0," As a viewer that actually went to TIFF and witnessed this film and didn't want to believe the hype, it is an absolute MASTERPIECE and Phoenix is a certified legend.
",
1," Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen
"," Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.<br/><br/>this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen. "
2," The Hype is real
"," Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway. "
3," Must have put a SMILE of Satisfaction on Heath Ledger's Face, right in the Heaven!
"," Truly a masterpiece, The Best film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And TRULY the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
I don't understand why critics are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, when the title character is infamous for it and fans were already rooting for this.
OSCARS are on their way! "
4," Only certain people can relate
"," This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated. "
5," MASTERPIECE üòç
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime "
6," Went for a second time to watch
"," I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it. "
7," JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.
"," Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director "
8," A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick
",
9," Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.
"," It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience. "
10," Good lord
"," The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh. "
11," Venice 76 review
"," I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October. "
12," Finally, a REAL movie
"," This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.<br/><br/>If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you. "
13," Not a spoon feeding of CGI fueled faux drama.
"," The movie affects you in a way that makes it physically painful to experience, but in a good way. "
14," Critics are useless!
",
15," Oscar for Phoenix
", I will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting. 
16," One of the best acting performances I've ever seen
"," Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.<br/><br/>I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be. "
17," Best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises
",
18," Joker > Endgame
"," Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways. "
19," BELIEVE THE HYPE
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both. "
20," Masterpiece.
"," The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8. "
21," Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinema
",
22," Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seen
"," Phoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down. "
23," Snoby critics get over yourselves
"," NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>Great movie. Tasteful references to 'The King of comedy'. Somewhat in line with the Batman story line. Cinematography, acting, story, character progression, comedic tones... All perfect.<br/><br/>A good watch, highly recommended it. I don't know who is paying these critics to write such BS reviews. You're not original when you rate a good movie badly. We all know you are just doing it for attention/clicks/fame. Yours is a dying breed and the more pointless reviews you write the less we will care about you. Grow up. "
24," Requiem of a broken man
"," The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity""
&amp; Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips &amp; is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography &amp; backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack &amp; acting. A hauntingly beautiful film &amp; A Definate 10/10.
Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!. "
25," Movie of the Decade
"," The pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a ""good boy"". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it. "
26," ""That's Life.""
"," In an era of cinema so saturated with superheroes and gritty remakes, Todd Phillips and Phoenix somehow take a character so deeply intrenched in pop culture and create something compelling and unique. This film is unafraid to be bleak and scary without offering much to the viewer as a means of comfort. The only way we can deal with the harsh cruelties of the world is by treating it as a joke. Upon leaving this movie, you will not hate Joker, you will hate the world that made him.<br/><br/>Phoenix simply cannot be praised enough. He brings both sympathy and tragedy in the way he moves his eyes, the way he contorts his shoulders, the way he laughs. A lesser actor would be unable to swing his moods from as far extremes as Phoenix does nor add the layers that Phoenix intricately builds for his character. The way he twists and writhes his body is mesmerizing and brings even more tragedy to the Joker. This is Phoenix's movie.<br/><br/>As for the technical side, this movie is far different than any other super hero films of recent years. The cinematographer and director choose a shallow focus, giving Pheonix a) the undivided attention of the viewer and b) a more personal feel to the film. There are wide shots with deep focus, but they are used sparingly because this movie is about a character, not action or explosions. The color palette of this movie is intentionally composed of dour greens, blues and tepid yellows--- all of which gives the world a sickly feel. The soundtrack is used affectively, bringing waves of optimism to intentionally clash with our protagonist's angry depression. This film will likely be compared to The Dark Knight and DCEU films, which I don't find to be fair. This film is far more akin to The Machinist and The King of Comedy in tone and visual style.<br/><br/>I recommend this film, and I think anything short of an Oscar nomination for Phoenix would be disrespectful to the effort he gives. However, I have one gripe I would like to voice. I found the tie-ins to the Wayne family to be unnecessary. It came across as pandering to an audience that loves Easter eggs more-so than the story itself. In my opinion, I think the story would have worked even better if it had distanced itself from the Batman story. Other than that, I had little issue with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Joker is a movie that tells us life is full of sadness, and then gives us a character whose purpose is to spread laughter and joy. I was going to finish this review with a joke, but, you wouldn't get it. "
27," Probably one of the best comic book movies out there with a performance of Phoenix that will make you speechless at the end #Venice76
"," Still days after seeing it, I'm still stunned by this film. I was lucky enough to see this film at the night of August 31 at the 76th Venice International Film Festival with high anticipations, and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker was hands down the best of the entire year. His performance reminds me why we love to watch actors play other people, why performance is such an appreciated art form. His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck, a wannabe stand up comedian to the crazy prince of thieves, the Joker, was a thing of beauty to watch. Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, you don't see Phoenix on the screen, but the character of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix might has not topped Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion, but damn was he close and he deserves every acting award possible.
The film offers a dark look of 1970s Gotham City; a dark, griddy atmosphere where there is no joy nor happiness in this world, and in many moments, the movie gave me instant ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"" vibes - two of Martin Scorsese's best films - without copying both films, but includes elements from both films like e.g. all the political tensions in the city are definitely borrowed from ""Taxi Driver"" and all the bits with the stand-up comedy from ""The King of Comedy"".
The film was a deep character study of a man with some psychological and health issues who simply wants to bring laughter to this world by performing as a clown in e.g. child's hospitals and performing as a stand-up comedian. But his mental health and this broken, sad, depressive society that doesn't know any joy, do not let him be the way he is and all the people around him see him as too weird/different and simply want to put him down; in the streets, in his workplace, at his mother's house etc. to the point where he simply finds a breaking point and loses his mind every day that goes by, which leads him to kill people and then become a symbol of terror and chaos towards the end. And at every moment something bad happens to Arthur Fleck - and yes, a whole lot of things happens in his life aka. to him throughout the film - you just feel sad for him, you mourn for him since he never seemed to have any intentions of harming people at first so that the audience exactly understands the things he does throughout the film. I'm not gonna go any further into plot details since the film's not yet out and I believe - even if it wouldn't have the name ""Joker"" in the title - that everybody should go and watch this film because we don't get such deep sophisticated character study films like this everyday - especially if such films gets mainstream attention. I enjoyed every second watching this character slowly falling apart.
Although I do think that the character of Zazie Beetz was totally useless and lead to nowhere, could have been easily cut out. That's probably my only negative with this film.
But still; it's a thought provoking masterpiece that has a lot to say - about the current situation of society -beyond being just a comic book movie. It offers a completely different take on the character of the Joker with some similarities to ""The Killing Joke"" with lots of surprising twists (one word: Wayne) that even connects it with the Batman comics and will leave you speechless. And half the greatness of this film is thanks to the great performance of Phoenix!
I'm gonna say this: the scene in the third act where the Joker appears live on TV at the Murray Franklin show - which was shown in the final trailer - blew me personally away, the tensions, the build up, Phoenix's greatness and even Robert De Niro's acting, was a heartbeat moment to me. Not spoiling it, but it's amazing. I can't wait to rewatch it when it comes out in October...Check it out as soon as it comes out! #Venice76 "
28," CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived
"," 10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography.
Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care.
Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker.
I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors.
Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away
1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker. "
29," What a remarkable insight into those who suffer from mental illness.
"," This movie was sensational.
The actors, the cinematography and most importantly the insight into mental illness and it's victims.
There is such a stigma towards mental illness and watching this movie really highlights some of the reasons that an individual may develop a mental illness, and how someone's childhood and upbringing can effect mental health throughout there entire life.
The joker had serious trauma throughout his childhood, and it came to surface in adult hood as you can see in the movie.
The build up of the movie from start to finish was very intense and overwhelming.
It highlights the stigma people can have towards mental illness and should be an eye opener for those who are too quick to judge people.
Sensational movie. I would recommend this to anybody. Huge thumbs up. "
30," This is a movie that stays with you.....
"," The anticipation that I felt walking into this movie is very rare. I can only compare it to the same feeling of walking into a Christopher Nolan movie or Avengers endgame. It's an incredibly high bar of expectation and there was a thick atmosphere of excitement in the theater. I found this movie to be a masterpiece of film-making with an incredible lead performance. It covers the full spectrum. Wonderful storytelling and emotional beats, mixed with powerful dialogue and beautiful cinematography. The movie doesn't shy away from violence, and there is even some humorous moments of levity among the chaos and madness. I can't say enough about Joaquin Phoenix. He's a very special talent. The subtlety of his abilities are a joy to behold. He's a master of his craft. There are many standout moments in this movie and it tackles many very real issues - such as mental health awareness and social isolation. Highly recommended. "
31," Unparalleled
"," Incredible, believable depiction of not only mental illness but of a man who can be seen as a legitimate human being in the real world. Unlike Heath (RIP), this Joker is less of a ""performance"" and more of a legitimate depiction of the real mental illness GOOD people face. He reconstructs what ""good"" truly is and, in contrast, the powers that be define what ""good"" is for their own advantage.<br/><br/>Rant/related to movie content:
The wealthy make laws to ***k all the other people they deem inferior or unwealthy, and a lot of us really are ***ked by the likes of these elitist egotistical devils.<br/><br/>Anyways, enough of that. Watch the movie. "
32," Wanted to rewatch it as soon as the credits came up
"," The character development in this film is amazing. Reflecting on the person you saw at the beginning of the film and at the end are so totally incomparable. Heath Ledger set a high bar, and this film was a fantastic and different take on a story. It was totally gripping - one of those films you talk about for 2 hours solidly after seeing. "
33," Powerfull Movie!
"," This movie is a masterpiece. If you ever were bullied or have had depressions and felt like everybody is against you, you will feel with the joker through the whole movie.
This movie is unsettling from the get go and gets only worse from there on (but in a good way:)). As we witness how the character - Arthur Fleck, who will become the joker - is gradually sinking into insanity, caused by the selfish and cold world he lives in and by his own psyche.
The role of the Joker is delivered brilliantly by Joaquine Phoenix, who in my opinion, deserves an oscar for it.<br/><br/>But beware!
Its a movie unlike other superhero movies. This one is more of a character study of the joker, why he became who he is. I would sort it into the Genre of Drama/Thriller. "
34," Joaquin is fanatic
"," I'm just gonna say wait for the 2nd half.
Its a masterpiece. "
35," Cinematic Masterpiece
", I read reviews before watching the film and was not disappointed! Joquain's performance..... the cinematography..... the fact that it was relatable in regards to mental illness.... it was all-consuming and I was enthralled the entire time! I'll be going back to see this again in the next few days and I NEVER do that! 
36," Saw it tonight and had to make an account so I can tell everyone how good it is
"," Seriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time "
37," THIS IS HOW A DC MOVIE SHOULD BE!
"," This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Critics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!<br/><br/>And remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through. "
38," Incredible
"," The first time I've come out of the cinema in a long time feeling satisfied, excited and amazed. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie, with his portrayal of the joker being immersive and entertaining. Every aspect was amazing- great choice of songs, brilliant acting and beautiful cinematography. So impressed! "
39," BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR
"," The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end, Joker is the most difficult character to do and I think Joaquin did it!! "
40," Astonishing Masterpiece
"," What an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right. "
41," First time writing a review... that's how good this is
"," Please go watch this movie! This is the first time I've ever wrote a review on this app and I've been using it to read reviews for years! That's how good this film is. Very dark, grimy and disturbing, exactly how an origin film about the joker should be. I have no doubt it will win multiple oscars. Do yourself a favor and go see it!!! "
42," Oscar Sooner or later
"," W.O.W!!!
What can I say about how brilliant Phoenix act performance is ??
In shortcut,movie of the year üíØ/üíØüëè "
43," Stunning
"," One of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy<br/><br/>
Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene "
44," Stop comparing it with Endgame
"," Joker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :) "
45," Clear the Shelf for the Oscars
"," I am not a Batman fan nor am I particularly fond of Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie was truly exceptional. It started slow but built to a viscerally satisfying crescendo. I never thought I would be rooting for the Joker, but found that I did so throughout the movie. The Joker's pain was so palpable. I am filling out my Oscar pool card right now.<br/><br/>PS This movie is dark and violent and decidedly not a super hero movie. Leave the kids at home. "
46," Unbelievably Perfect
"," I've never wrote a review, I regret every rating I've ever given a movie because of the tens I've put that pale in comparison to this masterpiece. What an amazing flick. Words can not describe the brilliance of Phoenix. Masterful. Mesmerizing. "
47," It is 'horrifyingly beautiful'....
", I can't explain actually that how perfect this film is. 
48," A total 10/10.
"," Joker is the best movie to release this year. I doubt any movie releasing this year will come close to it. Joker tackles mental illnesses perfectly. Despite the brutalities he's caused throughout the movie, you can't just help yourself but to feel sorry for him. I'd be a liar if I said I didn't cry at least twice during the movie. Fleck really shows how one bad day can drive you over the edge. It perfectly depicts how mental illnesses can drive you to do inhumane stuff. The violence in Joker felt way too real, all the deaths in the film, the 3 Wall Street guys, Arthur's mom, Randall, Murray Franklin. I felt like I was there for the deaths. The death that hit me the most was Murray, it was so sudden and out of the blue. Arthur really looked up to Murray as a father figure, an icon. When Arthur admitted to killing the Wall Street guys, that's when he really turned into Joker. Arthur Fleck was long gone.<br/><br/>Joker really isn't a movie. It's a wake up call. It's a fictionalized documentary. It goes to show how one bad day can destroy your entire life. If you're suffering from mental illnesses, please don't hesitate to ask for help. "
49," A harsh and emotional masterpiece
", I just watched the Joker and it was so powerfull and its one of the only movies that makes you think about our society and our actions. Its such a masterpiece. A true work of art. 
50," Masterpiece with one flaw
", Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in a while. The one flaw it has was probably that it could of made the lines of what was a dream the whole time and what was reality smoother. 
51," The best thing DC has done since Dark Knight
"," Joker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters. "
52," Applauding audience
"," The moment the end credits where starting I had tears in my eyes and felt the urge to applaud, which is not happening in a cinema in Belgium ever! I hesitated but what a surprise: the whole audience started applauding and I could join anonymously...
I am a movie lover and 61. I must say that this is the most impressive movie I have ever seen. Pure melodrama. A true masterpiece. "
53," Better than it had a Right to be. (And its Right to be was Beyond Sky-High)
"," Nicholson's Joker was a Gangster. Ledger's Joker was an Anarchist. Phoenix's Joker...is a Human Being.
As a typical viewer I must say I am burnt out over Marvel's popcorn-selling machines called movies, and am always more for the gritty, challenging films which DC and Christopher Nolan had made. This is a film so realistic, so grounded in reality that I forgot it was based on a DC comics character. This is not an action film. This is not adventure. This is a character-study. It felt more like a biopic of a tragic character of a criminal- and that it is. It is a story of HOW the Joker came to be and less of WHAT he does. This film was better than I thought it would be, and I am glad we have it. It may not make as much money, but I am certain it will be better remembered than Marvel's ""Endgame""- and will reinvent this genre of film the way Nolan's 2008 masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"" did.
Phoenix and Ledger are the best Jokers- I refuse to choose one over the other. "
54," One of the most fascinating and engrossing films ever made
"," Joker is absolutely brilliant. It's gritty and utterly captivating. It's a tough watch at times and yet you can't look away. I would not recommend it for the faint of heart, but if you love crime drama, 1970s movies, or very early Scorsese films you might enjoy Joker. The film is getting a tough rap from the mainstream critics, mainly because it's very divisive, but also because it shines a harsh light on some very rough subjects, including class warfare, access to health care, and the mental health crisis in America. If any of these things make you uncomfortable don't go see this film. As for my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and so does the director. Yeah, it's that good.<br/><br/>One last thing, the photography demands that you see it in the best possible quality. Also, for goodness sake, don't let your kids see this movie. This is not a Batman film. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. It's a ""hard R"" crime drama. "
55," I created an account just to rate and comment on this movie. I am not a batman movies fan.
"," I'm not usually a fan of comic based movies. I was never a fan of batman because I'm having a hard time taking people in costumes seriously. I went to watch joker because all of the hype and I was genuinely expecting it to be a so-so performance. I went there watching the Heath Ledger's joker before, which was OK in my opinion, as I said, I'm not a batman movies fan.
However.
This movie is not about batman, is not about comics, is not about superheros. This is a drama film. A drama which touches you deep inside on a special level, a movie which you feel because at least once you will sympathize with the joker. You will find yourself debating inside, whether he should be excused for his actions. Seeing Phoenix portray Arthur, from a beaten man, to become THE joker, quite by accident, is an extraordinary journey. The movie deserves all the praise it gets, and some.
I can't recommend the movie enough, as it's just THAT good. "
56," Masterpiece
"," Yesterday was that day, when I understand, that I have touched history. This movie will drag you in your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering. This masterpiece will grind you, like a meat grinder and you will watch it in silence and with open mouth. Like the whole cinema will.
I don't like comics movie, marvel is very pompous, absurd and insipid. In my opinion. It's not an art, it's just an attraction. As DC movies was too. But now DC made history, the made art and made drama.
To be more understandable. When you watch for example Avengers or League of Justice you are eating McDonald's hamburger. But when you watch Joker you are eating 1000$ stake in the most luxurious restaurant in the world. "

", The ending is what matters in a movie. And this movie has a kind of ending which would leave many speechless. It's indeed a masterpiece:) 
59," Took my 65 year old mother to see it.
"," I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it's a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn't even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.<br/><br/>She loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the ""social commentary"" the movie conveys.<br/><br/>Her score: 9 / 10<br/><br/>Mom is always right. "
60," Perfect
", Creative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10 
61," I would not call it a masterpiece as some did
"," There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.<br/><br/>
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.<br/><br/>
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer. "
62," Amazing !
"," One of the best films I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for his portrayal of Arthur Fleck. The unraveling of a person suffering from mental illness was tough to watch in some scenes but I never felt his behaviour wasn't justified. I left the cinema feeling sorry for a man who'd always felt different and had been treated badly from a young age. JP didn't just throw himself into the role , he became Arthur. Not as violent as I was expected either so I don't reslly understand the controversy when it was released. "
63," This movie is no Joke
"," Thinking to Joker it is a haunting, beautiful film that shines in it's brutality. Not in terms of the violence, but more along the lines of witnessing one man's journey into madness. Each event, each action provides a great amount of weight along with an unease factor.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's performance was phenomenal and you can feel the heartbreak along with the mental strain that continously pushes him into a dark mind set.<br/><br/>The grittier nature of Gotham, combined with the beautiful score really help sets the mood, and the songs from Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante adds whole another of class in midst of the slums. The Cinematography manages to catches the beauty, and the despair of a Gotham city that is falling apart, not too mention that the score and licensed songs help add another layer to the film. "
64," Joker = Masterpiece!
", Maybe the best movie in about 20 years or so. I was just blown away. 
65," By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.
"," Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic. "

Thanks for making this film! 
72," What a movie...
"," Joker actually is a mix of different genres and elements who create something unique.
You can see the Taxi Driver or King of Comedy influences but Todd Phillips Movie has more things to say ... and Joaquin's Phoenix performance helps him to do that 100 %.
I think it's the best character development I've see in a movie and the screenplay it's artistic written. Even if doesn't follow the comic mythology at all and it's very realistic and less comic book movie, Joker has a lot of elements of Batman Mythology and gives some hint to DC fans. Dark, brutal, funny and sad at the same time ... Joker is one of the best movies of the recent years. "

If you are the type to have your nachos, check your phone or even go to the toilet in the middle of a movie then just pass on this movie altogether and save everybody the half hearted critique.<br/><br/>I have no idea how some have rated this 1. I mean even in my first visit, with my misunderstanding, it still was a good movie, just didn't realise HOW good!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Only after my revisit, have I realised that I am witnessing the emergence of a timeless classic. Its too much to take in. No movie in the past decade has managed to break into the top 20 rated movies of all time( IMDB)( With the exception of Inception ). Joker has danced his way into the big leagues with ease.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The writing is perfectly woven from start to finish. Everything in the movie adds up. It is a really depressing movie, a wake up call to those looking to wake up.<br/><br/>The 1 star ratings given to this movie are by the ones who enjoy sleeping I guess, or just too scared to face the misery of reality outside the borders of their beds.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This movie is just too much to comprehend. Your emotions will be tackled, your sympathy will be questioned, and your morals will definitely be in check.<br/><br/>We don't live in this world alone, but many of us rather live pretending to.
The symbolism is refreshing and the lessons are intimidating.<br/><br/>
It is a major mistake to compare Heath Ledger's Joker to Joaquin's. The plot and genre of both movies are totally different. Dark Knight's Joker was a cool, diabolic mastermind, a savage genius, full of charisma and dark humour. Not to take anything away from Heath's legendary performance, but the writing of Dark Knight, along with the sequence of events , really helped catapult Heath Ledger's Joker to an unprecedented summit. Imagine Heath Ledger playing the Joker with my writing? ... Exactly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Both actors have mastered their portrayal of Joker in their own way. No comparison is valid.<br/><br/>Both actors have shown the dark side of the Joker.<br/><br/>Joaquin was just too dark, too much.<br/><br/>I have read somewhere that a critic said something on the lines of "" the world is not ready for a movie like Joker"", well spot on. Might I add, the world is a circus and Joker is the elephant in the room.<br/><br/>
Lets just enjoy the fact that there are two Jokers in the top 20 rated movies of all time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is the kind of movie you would want to watch again and again and again. Not because you're insane, but because the world is, and your sanity is just too precious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Joke Uh<br/><br/><br/><br/>One last point:<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br/><br/><br/><br/>My take on the final Crash scene:<br/><br/><br/><br/>When mental healthcare is trivialized or overlooked ,(Ambulance)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Security becomes in jeopardy (police)<br/><br/>And in turn,<br/><br/>People will find it hard to move around(Taxi)<br/><br/>And society will ultimately become paralysed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Finally,<br/><br/>Don't forget to smile.

In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point. "

100," Spare me the ""best comic book movie ever"" nonsense.
"," It premiered last night in Sydney and I was lucky enough to watch this masterpiece first hand.
The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive.
The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.
Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to. "
101," Best character driven movie.
"," I was blown away by the script and performance.
Artistic, gritty, brilliant.
Oscar for Todd and Joaquin. "
102," One of THE BEST PERFORMANCE ever!
"," Wow, it takes a while to find the right words to describe this movie. It's different! It feels like a character study, almost like a documentary but at the same time as if you'd be watching a horror drama movie as intense as it is and realistic.
It touches on mental health issues which sadly this country is struggling with but won't admit to it. This film has the best character development I could possibly think of! Now I will say this:
JOKER is the last movie you'd ever want to show to kids! Not even teenagers should see this! It might be a tough one for them to see as it is brutal, bloody and might even be simply too much to handle. I saw some walk out of the theater and if you're a very sensitive person you might do the same! However, it is by far the best film and performance of the year and there's no doubt Joaquin Phoenix should win all awards for this including the Oscar! And in my opinion while it is a different take on the JOKER, this is the best portrayal of the JOKER.
Go see this with an open mind, and if possibly without expectations. This will definitely spark many conversations and most likely arguments as well. "
103," Uncomfortably Satisfying
"," To say it was satisfying would be somewhat misleading. Joaquin Phoenix makes you feel uncomfortable almost the entire time. I couldn't help thinking about Christian Bale in The Machinist and Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. With those comparisons, clearly I have some high praise on the acting.<br/><br/>The film itself slowly builds momentum, but when it builds...it's really builds. Those looking for traditional comic book action may feel it moves a bit slow, but it's pace allows for the transformation to not feel superficial. When you walk out of the theater you won't know exactly how to feel, but you'll surely want to know how everyone else feels about it. "
104," Cinematic Masterpiece
"," Acting, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips &amp; amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher. "
105," Without a doubt 10/10
", I have never been so moved by a fictional film. Truly amazing and im speechless. 
106," Joker: an outsider before a criminal
"," What's the most important thing that connect a character with the public? A deep, psycological interior drama. That's what brings this cinecomic upper from others similar movie. Joker is a protagonist that you'll never forget, I'll garantee you! More human and less fictional character: it could be a story of a normal man that try to survive in this mad world where there's no right or wrong and the real normality is to be mad, it's a Pirandellian concept in a way but that's the main theme. Even Gotham and the people who live in are seen in a new, dark, cynical and more actual than ever view. An origin movie that you'll never expect. I don't spend a single word talking about how perfect is every technical aspect because probably you know yet and of course, Joaquin Phoenix is a legend. Maybe the representation of Thomas Wayne could get a little bit angry the most passionate fans in a way but apart this, for me is 10/10.
I hope we'll talk about this in the future as a brother of The Dark Knight. "
107," Speechless
"," How can i speak something that my feeling cant even contain.. this is truly greatness.. a movie that moved you into something that you cant describe, so stressful, painful and sorrow, depressing, twisting, and oddly beautiful.

108," Disturbingly brilliant film making

109," This time thumbs up!
"," What a fantastic evening out - with son and daughter (both older than the lead!) and loads of popcorn to see Joaquin Phoenix give the performance of his life in Joker.
No spoilers and a huge amount to contemplate and revisit in further viewings. Suffice to say this is a slow burn movie with brilliant director, leading cast and cinematography and run down Gotham City staging that makes this a mesmerising movie experience. Everyone will be talking about their favourite moments - mine includes a certain door key!
Joaquin as the evil Emperor Commodus gave us the famous 'thumbs down' to Russell Crowe as Maximus in Gladiator but it is a resounding 'thumbs up' for his remarkable portrayal of mentally ill Arthur Fleck in his descent to madness to become the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.

"
111," Put on a happy face!!
"," To appreciate ""Joker"" I believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is (which usually comes from having gone through something traumatic, unfortunately). An example of dangerous compassion would be to, say, make a film made about the fragility of the human psyche, and make it so raw, so brutal, so balletic that by the time you leave the theatre you not only don't want to hurt anything but you desperately want an answer and a solution to the violence and mental health issues that have spun out of control around us.

112," Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know
"," Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.<br/><br/>Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.<br/><br/>The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.<br/><br/>Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker. "
113," Brilliant

114," Not everyone's cup of tea
"," If you are someone, who is a bit more sensitive and is scared of violent movies, this movie will touch you.<br/><br/>If you are someone, who expects a lot of action and does not bother with violence, this movie can be disappointing.<br/><br/>To me it feels that this movie was more about getting a message about nowadays society sent to everyone and also about getting a performance of a lifetime for Joaquin Phoenix than actually about the story itself or Joker.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it but expected more. When the movie ended, this is where I actually wanted for the movie to begin as it seemed like the actual beginning of Joker! "
115," A gorgeously crafted baroque film with a sheer hollow inside.

116," Why all the concern from the professional reviewers? This movie is so good!
"," No need for Deniro's name in ads. Phoenix IS the show. I am angry at so many negative reviews focusing on ""the violence"". Can't this just be a story? Does it have to teach some lesson? Does this have to include a discussion about mental health? Can't this just be a ""making of story"" about the most iconic villian in any comic universe? In the last 15 min when Arthur ""becomes"" , I found myself raising my arms, yes! As i walked out, I felt like i wanted to drive home at 90 mph! I loved this movie. I loved this film. I loved the director. I loved Joaquin. I didn't want to join any cause. I don't want to change my life. But days later, I am still amazed what a great movie this was! "
117," Kind of a letdown....
"," The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction....<br/><br/>....the film is kinda boring.<br/><br/>It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.<br/><br/>The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it.

Like a child who needs some love but has been deprived of it.<br/><br/>I like the hospital scene where the drops the gun and puts a finger on his lips suggesting the kids to keep quiet about the episode.<br/><br/>All these scenes still show that probably Arthur has some traces of innocence before he accepted the darkness inside. "
121," The rundown on why people may or may not like the movie
"," I loved the movie and believe it is one of my personal favorites ever, but many people are giving it bad reviews. This movie will please those who understand it and see the underlying messages, which makes it powerful, moving, entertaining, and real. But if you don't see the true meaning (or don't want to), it just seems like an unnecessarily dark and violent addition to the Batman ""franshise"". Another reason some people may dislike this movie and find it ""boring and too slow"" is because there is an extraordinary lack of CGI, which for me personally makes it all the better... and then some. If this sounds like a negative to you, please stick to The Avengers and don't waste your time, because you will. It's not cookie cutter, it's not a money grab, it's a movie that makes you think and can be perceived in many ways. Exceptional writing and a surreal acting performance turns this would-be great movie into something truly special.
There isn't a right way for Joker to be perceived, there is just a wrong way, and that's where the bad reviews come from, expecting something it was never meant to be, while missing/overlooking the greatness of this film. "
122," The best performance
"," One of the best movies i had ever seen , so dramatic .... great performance by Joaquin, it was one man show , definitely an oscar winning "
123," Everthing i hoped for
"," As a fan of Phoenix i was eagerly anticipating a stand out performance despite the disparaging comments about the bad protrayal of mental health issues...and i wasn't dissapointed. I cannot imagine a better actor to portray the Joker and the level of violence, whilst expected , wasn't in my opinion overdone. Not usually a fan of comic book movies...i am now decidedly more on board. "
124," Simply Perfect
"," I never write a review of the movie until today. This is the perfect roll for Joaquin
Phoenix, and i think it's because he didn't have to act too much. I must say that this movie made me look for all his rolls and is his one of the kind actor that he is highly underrated. This performance doesn't deserve number in grades, it desreve respect .But the real winner of this story is Todd Phillips, ( I bet he knoe what Joaquin can pool off, and he sow it right from the beginning), because it was a complicated story that only Joaquin could pull off; I really don't see another actor can make this role. And we can all wonder how many Joker DNA we have inside of ourselves, how much we become slaves to this system that can cannot import slaves anymore but they are sure that we are all be productive like they was before. "
125," Awesome
"," Absolutely awesome. Best comic film since The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joaquin's performance is simply perfect. Direction and soundtrack fit perfectly and storyline is well executed and well thought out. "
126," masterpiece!!
"," I don't really want to be a guy to tell, please go and watch this. I believe just a certain number of cinema lovers would really appreciate this film. I have not seen such great movie in years. Please cinema come back to good-old-days!! "
127," Not what I expected
", When Heath ledger played the joker he memorized the audience with such a brilliant performance. Not in a million years could I imagine anyone could do it again. Enter Mr phenoix if there where ever to be a real world joker this would be it. The dramatic character change from Arthur fleck to joker is unbelievably twisted and dark basically the Jokers middle names. The portrayal of the joker in this film for me deservers a standing ovation. 
128," Amazing from start to finish
"," As someone who's loved Batman (and the Joker, respectively) since I was a child, I think I was going to enjoy the film regardless of how it turned out. Despite the fact that I was so hyped, I still had low expectations. So when I got up after two hours in the auditorium, I was blown away by how fresh and riveting the film was. Joaquin Phoenix played the role perfectly, and the character and story was beautifully created by Todd Phillips. Some of the dialogue wasn't very memorable, but then I realised that not every line has to be. After all, this film was meant to be what could possibly happen in a real scenario, and not everything said in real life is poetic or memorable. So that being said, I really have no faults with this movie. It was everything I wanted and more. "
129," A Loser Kicked One Too Many..
"," I didn't intend to see this movie at all, because I thought what can a Batman movie bring anew, and I was surprised to read oldest cinema festival in the world gave it Best Picture award. It felt displaced.
Then I have seen the amazed reactions from viewers, saying it wasn't what they have expected, one was even (half seriously, half jokingly - hey, like Joker!) flirting with social uprising in his comments. (Joker says he's not political. He's just one of the lowest, being pushed one too often. The lowest masses can identify with that, so some audiences around the world joined in spontaneous applause. In less confident societies, such movies got banned.)<br/><br/>So, I have decided to see it, and yes, it's not your usual blockbuster from the Batman franchise. Such a movie, with main character having mental issues, societal issues, family issues, relationships issues, sort of Turrets Syndrome issues as a nervous tick, younameit issues, would usually fit the Sundance or even more alternative, indie, heavy movies festivals, not receiving praises from mainstream audiences, having a 9something rating on IMDB and breaking the overall October opening record in domestic market. Youth is filling the cinemas to see it, although there's not one flashy gadget or usual CGI scene from the franchise. Have the times really changed and will newer generations demand a wholesame approach to all the disadvantaged (and the Earth)? Oscars buzz all over the place. Perfect songs to perfect scenes. The atmosphere and ambience of the movie is visually depressing, pressing down on a drowning, smiling hero. If you gotta go, go with a smile.. Modern society is convincing an individual, that success is in own hands, while individual and life are in fact a summary of ones experiences. Joker is a recognizable character, every loser trying not to be one, can identify with him..
When Joker says, he's got nothing left to loose, before loosing it, after he's been trying really hard to be a good and normal, contributing member of the society (even trying to have an intellectual career as a stand up comedian, although not realistic, yet also doing demeaning jobs like a rolling sign; not demeaning for a teenager/student job..), and whole movie convinces you it's society's fault he became the monster we know, you start thinking it's surprising all those homeless people don't start killing everyone. Maybe they still have more decency as a person, than society, that put them there. I can also understand the already expressed worries, movie might send some troubled mind on a shooting spree again.. Mistreated persons might go crazy. Because this world secretly prefers failures, that is common already from primary school class dynamics (if everyone around you is a failure, it makes you more of a success).
If the movie reflects worrying reality of the world, the problem is in reality, not the movie.. "
130," Absolutely fantastic! Ignore the sniffy critics
", I never get swept up in the hype of films. But this film is worthy of it. An absolute masterpiece. Phoenix is magical in his performance. Seen it twice already! 
131," Engaging from start to finish
"," This film was engaging from the very first moment to the very last. That is not to say every moment was a blockbuster high action event, but the acting, pacing, and staging of every scene was so dynamic and carefully crafted that one feels engaged at all times, regardless of energy level. Joaquin Pheonix is truly a master of acting, and his ability to completely transform into Arthur is astounding. The piece that truly sells his role as Joker are his eyes: he truly has a madness in his eyes and they pierce through the screen. This film does not seem to fit into any one genre (horror, action/adventure, comedy) but rather is more like a character study and artistic demonstration on the formation of Joker in Gotham City. This is a modern, self-aware, psychologically relevant perspective on a traditionally outlandish, wild, and inexplicably wild villain from DC cannon. This sets a new standard for DC films, and puts the previous flops to even greater shame. "
132," Scary thoughts comes from funny minds
", Nothing to say just to congratulate Todd Philips on this masterpiece 
133," Don't know what stopped me to Review the Joker ?
"," Joker Review i<br/><br/>Hamad Saif Al Reyami<br/><br/>
Still after 3rd time watching Joker I do not know what stopped me from reviewing this Film? I will try my best to Review it! Although There are many Reviews and videos published for Joker but what I will say it will not be a spoiler .<br/><br/>The story from the Joker perspective:
My name is Arthur, someone who is undesirable in this society. Even my lean body doesn't attract anyone! My mother is a sick person and I take care of her and she is the only person who I admire in my life.
I enjoy watching (Murray ) program on television, which adds to me some kind of tenderness which is lost in my life .
A new life starts for me and I get to know my feelings clearly and what I need gradually forming.
The rest of the events I will not tell you here and it is better to identify it by watching the film, and Hamad Saif Al Reyami will complete to explain my and everyone performance who worked in making my character.
Since the Joker film has become an important phenomenon in the world of cinema and entered the atmosphere of the Oscars there are so many opinions and gossips has been talked about the film, so let me first to talk about the negativities of this movie, yes there are many negativities from point of some called critics!<br/><br/>Some said that Joker glorifying crimes and born more criminals in the so city. My answer is simply: Did (Godfather) which is considered one of the most beautiful works in cinema, trained criminals on how to shoot the gun and kill people by cold mind?
what about (Robert de Niro) character in (Taxi Driver) who have obsession with anti-society, where he became a criminal of nothing, did this character contributed to deployment a large number of terrorists, and this is also one of the glorified films in the cinema ?!
Therefore, the subject has nothing to do with artistic criticism. The conflict came from critics who may be professional in expressing their views on the political or economic issues of society. Some of them can conduct workshops and seminars on family relations. They didn't criticized Joker artistically! so this topic finished , some general public and viewers, who didn't like Joker were in small numbers and this is their right, but if we get to know each other closely, we will find most of them fans of (speed) or (super heroes) movies, I belive they were shocked by the Joker who is radically different from all the characters which been played in the series of ( Batman) and some of them come to the cinema hall just enjoy eating popcorn with a loud sound from their mouth , so how they can follow the film carefully! here I will start my critical review this movie.
What did Todd Philps done to make this film so special?
There are several important points exploited by Todd Philps the director of Joker which made me lay and magnetization my mind for two hours!
Todd used many technical skills I will mention some of them by my point of view :
The colors of the curtain in (Murry) show is similar to joker colors. A number of scenes, which contribute to the publication of special pictures and posters of the film in an elegant and mixed.
Every scene in the film looks like a picture from beautiful photograph album because the angles of the (Lawrence Cher), let us me capture now some scenes from the Joker you will find that you got an album from a professional photographs why those scenes looks so beautiful ? it is because of the colors and lighting and deliberate choices of places which fit to come out beautiful, such as graffiti or dyed characters in the window of the bus and make the streets wet and choose places that would copied in our mind like stairs and the metro stations, also he chose winter time for filming this movie to show all characters in thick clothes with multiple colors which match with the Joker mask.<br/><br/>
Moreover, most scenes were filmed at night to add the atmosphere of the film Grief and melancholy<br/><br/>.
Technical things can be handled easier than before and this may be a small percentage to make this film attractive, which was written by Todd and (Scott Silver) since 2017, joke character is completely different from previous films of ( Batman), so that is the challenge In writing the this kind of character<br/><br/>In order to prove this thing, the writers of the film have drawn characters and scenes in depth as I mentioned about visuals work ,here you will see new things in the character of the Joker like his laughing styles . anger lough, laugh sarcastically at society
, a laugh of pain and sorrow, and of course laugh just for laughing.
Each of his lough has different tone and a different of sound and there is a sad smile full of grief that we didn't feel in previous Joker characters.
The character of the Joker was painted on paper as Lean body to show a special aesthetic across the screen and this makes viewers involuntarily motivated enthusiastically to encourage this Joker, especially when he has the feeling of freedom from restrictions.
A special dance scene was added to the Joker, which is also a deliberate addition to explain his psychological state.
Blending psychological things in the film such as laughter when joker is in tension this thing never been written before in any film! Mostly those kind of situation used to show criminals in this kind of laugh scenes just to show the fierce character! but here you are very sympathetic to the Joker and laughing because of mental illness, this The behavior made me to study this character, through which you can deduce many things from human behaviors, whether positive or negative and here I find negativity more which is often the dominant and this contributed a lot in the sympathy with the character we see across the screen.<br/><br/>To support Joker story writers imagine this character in the beginning of the 80s were in which the revolution was fabricated in New York and of course in the film was based on the fictional city ( Gotham ) known in the Batman series ,some real events used here, Such as a commercial featuring Clint Eastwood in his age of 40s, as well as the title of a movie outside a cinema theater called (Zorro, The Gay Blade ) Which was released in 1981.
Soundtrack and music has been very appropriate in this film, when we talk about music and songs in Hollywood we recall romantic films like the legendary film (Titanic) with the famous song of (Celine Dion) or the music of the most famous gangsters film in the history (The Godfather) which carried special music
It stays as an echo in our ear And whenever you hear it anywhere, the godfather returns in your imagination<br/><br/>So this dark film( Joker ) carried songs and music from Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir<br/><br/>, all songs are accurate and was great choices in which made perfectly for the situation like the song (It's Life) comes in a scene that represents the life of Joker who made a decision for himself.
In my opinion, the bath dance music will be remain as one of the best art in the Hollywood music because of the aesthetics of the scene which beautifully directed by balanced dance, this was one of the important scene in the film and of course the instrument which is used for this tune was effective its called (Haldorophone)
Hildor coordinated her melody and experience for years until she made this to the joker.<br/><br/>The cast may have been less importance because of the the Joker character, but every character in the film present something important, Robert De Niro, who plays a comic television presenter which character remind us of the comic artist in the early 1980s (Robert Babkin). The fact that we did not get used to watching him in these roles, but from the 1st scene of him he enters with a musical welcoming which made me feel that he entered the mode of this character watch him in the climax scene with joker where he deliver great impact! Zizi Betz in the role of Sophie and her analogy with the formation of the fingers of her hands as a gun which is similar to the (taxi driver) character has a special role in the film, Francis Conroy as Arthur's mother does not have many dialogues but her impact is important in the conduct of the Joker life, Brett Cullen plays the role of Thomas Wayne Candidate for Gotham City is an important role in the formation of the Joker character.Joaquin Phoenix, will be known as Joker by many people even for who do not go to the cinema , he Calculates and estimates his role which was written on the paper, the control on his face, especially when he smile and laugh, and the style and the tone of his dialogue delivery is completely different from his previous films, I became watching him in two parts in the film, but you can recognize him by sound of laughing, His lean body is perfectly consistent with the character whether in the movement of walking or jogging as well as his face properly formed at the height of his cheeks up after the smile feel it is a perfect image of the character of the Joker which gives you the impression that no other actor can be suit to this role, honestly Joaquin made this role Immortalizing in the memory of Hollywood Although it is early to say that, but what Joaquin done is not seen for several years from any actors ! it will be so difficult for anyone to bag the best actor award this year from Joaquin ,will they need a miracle indeed for that!
Director Todd Philps has succeeded in giving us important lessons of feeling different cinema experience , the Paranormal world of DC comics has adapted the dramatic and human art very well , the question is whether DC will be continue to work on this ideas for other characters or it is just in case for the Joker?
The movie may be two hours long, but you will live with it for a long time. For those who refused Joker, They have to watch it again so that they will not lose the chance to savor this film which difficult to have in our time!
5 stars out of 5</div>"
134," I get tired of over-hyped movies
"," So many movies have been over-hyped. Like Inception. A great movie, but it was so built up, a slight let down was felt, and as usual the movie fell short of the incredible hype.<br/><br/>Joker is not that. It meets, nae, exceeds the scuttlebutt. If cookie cutter comics are your forte, better come without those glasses on.<br/><br/>This is a way to complete the Joker personality. There is no ambiguity now. He is a chaos loving psychopath. He doesn't love sticking it to the rich, he doesn't even love killing, he loves causing chaos, and stomping on those who garner the famous Joker laugh. Unfortunately, society at large, except a few truly underfoot souls, may be on that list.
Riviting in every way. "
135," A Masterpiece and critics are really off this time
"," This movie is so incredibly well done that I am writing a comment on IMDb for the first time. I truly have no words, or more like I want to say so many things that I dont even know where to begin.
Please watch it if you havent already, its the best thing you'll watch in a long time. "
136," Best,awesome,fantastic
", That was a best movie..acting was awesome..i like it..so nice...i think this movie can get oscar 
137," Beautiful and brilliant.
"," Having watched Hollywood decline alongside with the latest trend of the dumbing down of nations (as I call this phase we are in), has made going to the cinema more of an empty distraction than a meaningful experience for the past number of years. Thus, when I sat down to watch this movie my expectations were low, as usual. It turned out that this movie was one of the best movies I have ever watched on screen.<br/><br/>There is never going to be a Joker movie that can surpass this one - this was pure art scripted and performed by real talent. Joaquim Phoenix is also a real actor, unlike your usual dumb as hell, painfully overrated cadre of overpaid Hollywood pretty boys - who can't act.<br/><br/>10. "
138," What have i watched ?!
"," A great great movie with amazing acting
Best movie in a long time .
Best movie for this year for sure . "
139," True masterpeice
", Joker is a movie with few flaws. Phoenix performance is absolutely terifing and sympathetic at the same time. Throughout the movie you hear Arthur's haunting laugh the laugh is almost identical to mark hamils iconic cackle. The score elevates all of the situations with lots of tension. All in all joker is a fantastic film with best actor potential 
140," Outstanding!!!!!
", The best movie of the year by far and one of the best in years. The Phoenix interpretation is incredible. A movie repository for cinema.... 
141," Prodigious.
",
142," Highly recommended
"," One of the best films specially for a villain, Joker has reinvented the idea of the laughing clown and just gave a logic background for legder's Joker. "
143," Dark and profound.
"," I purposefully didn't read other reviews, as I wanted my opinion of this film to be my own. Did I enjoy it, possibly not. It wasn't entertaining or entertainment. What it was √† dark, very dark and deeply disturbing reflection of our dysfunctional society. A society where the most vulnerable in society are marginalised and don't get the help or support they need.
This is a film about mental health and seeing it on Mental Health Awareness day provided a more powerful message than all the items on the news, in the press and on social media.
Joaquin Phoenix in the title role was beyond description in the way he bought this character to life. Chilling, frightening and yet at the same time conveying the vulnerability of a man lost in his own world, where there is no one to support him and no one who will listen to him and understand him.
Don't expect to come out of this film feeling good about yourself, but don't be surprised if you find yourself asking questions about the world we live in. "
144," The best comic book movie ever?, maybe!
"," Well, I really don't know where to start, as Todd Phillips has clearly stated this movie has been inspired in the Batman comic books, but IT IS NOT, based directly in any comic o graphic novel ever published,Having said that, I consider this movie a masterpiece in every possible way. Undoubtedly one of the 10 best movies of this century, and also , without a doubt , one of the 100 best movies ever made in the history of cinema. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely incredible in his representation of the mentally ill Arthur Fleck, and as the Joker is, well, absolutely out of this world. The Oscar to best actor should not even enter the competition this year, it belongs to him. A stark portrait of the cruelty of modern society, a superb reminder that mental illness is real and affects thousands of people around the world. What more can be said? Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, and the rest of the crew and cast deserve a standing ovation. BRAVO !!!!!!!!!! "
145," For watch so many times
", This movie is a really art work! It's amazing! The best of 2019! Joaquin Phoenix always be live in our hearts 
146," Insane
"," Just come from a screening and must say this was an incredible film. Phoenix deserves all the glory he is receiving for the lead role. Philip's is restraint and proves he is quite talented outside the usual comedy film. This film is insane and the story beats are unpredictable. As a modern day comic book film, you must admit WB has taken quite the gamble and it has paid off. A darker DC was promised by Snyder, but BVS was a mess of ideas. Joker is interesting and you'll either enjoy or dislike the film. Ambitious and a film with longevity. Will Ratcatcher be introduced in future films? "
147," Bleak and brilliant
"," Bleak, brilliant, horrendous and fantastic all at once. "
148," Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix!
"," This was just brilliant! It's been a long time since I enjoyed a DC film. Got no words, Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance as the Joker. "

151," Took joker to a different level
"," Phoenix's joker is definitely different than Heath's joker . Took joker to a different level. But the main thing , do not compare the two jokers. Both show two different phases in the life of Arthur Fleck. "
152," its a dark chocolate comedy
"," Dark and rich melting in my mouth yet tastes creamy leave the strongest memorable perfect senses after the movie ends, will love it forever, Oscar will bring perfection 10 score ! "
153," SPOILERS I REPEAT SPOILERS
"," This movie is one of the best movies of all time. Jaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck really well, how he laughs and he is trying to express that he doesn't want to laugh, how he turns into a psychopath by killing his mother and the 3 guys on the subway how emotionless he becomes, killing Robert Da Niro and stuff. And I'm really happy that this movie was kept rated R because without the gore it wouldn't as great. I think that they should make him into a Thanos figure for a new DC universe where he appears in post-credit scenes and where they have a big movie where all the new heroes and Joker will go against each other in this bloody movie. "
154," Don't listen to the critics
", This film is incredible. It's harshly criticised for no reason. This film will impact modern cinema. 
155," Masterpiece!
"," The hype is real , Once in alifetime experience üíï "

"," This is so far one of the best movies I've ever seen. It shows you the real world. The real emotions of people, and how strong they are even if you are not able to see that. "
158," Masterpiece ... Worth The Hype ü§°
", My first ever review on IMDB and it's worth it .. The amazing Joaquin Phoenix had a difficult task on this role(Joker) as we will always gonna compare him to Heath Ledger and everyone who played the role before.<br/><br/>The outstanding acting and the mood that Phoenix's is going to take you through is just phenomenal. Yes the movie was inspired by Scorsese's Taxi Driver however the joker has his own and unique act.<br/><br/>I guarantee you won't feel the 2hrs of the movie GO AND WATCH IT ..!! 
159," Mind-blowing !
"," I truly believe that this is more than acting , a great great film "
160," Visceral tension throughout
"," A jaw dropping masterpiece of filmmaking. I kept waiting for it to get violent as the media hyped this to be something that would trigger would-be psychopaths. And though it had a few intense scenes, what made Joker a film that put me on the edge of my seat and caused me to forget to breathe was those moments when Arthur Fleck was so alone with his thoughts and fantasies; that he allowed himself to dive headlong into, making the audience question of what they were seeing was really happening to the character. I often found myself empathizing with the pain Phoenix placed inside of the character. And I could almost never anticipate what he was going to do next. That is what made me afraid, for two hours, to draw my next breath. "
161," Whats wrong with all those marvel kiddy fans?
"," The movie was a masterpiece , phoenix's acting was outstanding.
The movie tells the origin of the joker and people are mad cause there wasn't that much of ""joker scenes"" or ""joker moments"".
If you just want to see violence and killing/blood, go watch john wick or any action/no story movie "
162," Brutal piece of art!
",
163," Must see!
", It's a work of art. Everything from the music choices to the acting to cinematography and story progression is absolutely astounding. It gives a massive amount of background in his life and what turned him into the beautiful mess he becomes. I'll definitely be wat Hing this again and again. 
164," Great moviee
"," Best comic movie up to date ,amazing performance by jaouqin pheonix.really emotional "
165," What a movie
", Just brilliant and with great parallels to Christopher Nolan's Joker and Batman movies. Phoenix.... How can you be that good and actor? 
166," An Absolute Classic
", Joker is the film of the year for me! DC is killing it with their latest movies. I love marvel but this one is on another level. Give Phoenix an oscar! 
167," Something elseü§°
"," Just seen Joker.
What can i say....<br/><br/>I loved every second of this beautiful and depressing movie. Yes it's Phoenix from beginning til the end, but he playes Joker so convincingly, you could only feel for him, care for him and love him.
(And no, i am not mentally ill)<br/><br/>The entire movie is exceptionally well made, the story, the setting, the music and yes... Joaquin's portrayal of the joker is undoubtedly the most disturbing, I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Do not compare with Nicholson or Ledger (still favorite) just watch and let this Joker do the laughing.<br/><br/>No joke, the Oscar goes to..... "
168," Joaquin Phoenix IS Joker.
"," There have been many a Joker - from live action adaptations and animated adaptations - and this one, by Joaquin Phoenix, is the best one next to Heath Ledger's Joker. With this film released late in the year, perhaps Phoenix is a shoo-in for Best Actor. An excellent character study of a man battling a plethora of mental illnesses. Also, for those who have seen this movie, one question remains: How much of the movie is rooted in reality, and how much of it is in Arthur Fleck's mind? It's difficult to differentiate reality from fantasy. "
169," *This Surely Puts a Smile On My Face*
"," Tbh I have only one thing to say about this movie,
""Justice have been served"" "
170," üÉè üé∂ Send in the clowns ü§° üéµ
"," I.... I.... I have no words.... Because words alone couldn't describe how beautifully this movie is made... This is the lowest a man could go... While we do sympathize with Arthur, they also show us why we should never take the path he took.... The Joker's path... Every single actor nailed their roles and Joaquin must definitely win the academy this year... We could actually feel and go through his struggle and his pain... Like I said... Words doesn't do it justice... Go watch it... Experience it... And the last act of the film just blows your brain away (spoiler alert!!) "
171," An amazing collaboration- Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really done it!
",
172," Just amazing
", Very graphic and disturbing but you won't lose focus for a second. Astonishing performance by Phoenix. 
173," Masterpiece
"," My two cents: The message is that people can be as disturbed as can be, but the only thing that will lead them to the light is kindness. Let's see what happens if a person gets the oppossite.<br/><br/>Wrapped in a great movie with the greatest actor of our time. "
174," Reality of Society
"," This is not a movie to be enjoyed or entertained but taken as strong message to bring the humanity. I was expecting it to be great movie but it turned out to be 'one of the greatest' movie. This movie deserves multiple watch. This movie is all about how a man who is disregarded by the society, bitter treatment from society, abandoned by society, and failure as a comedian made him a serial killer. Never ever we should step into crime world because of the dark society. We always should seek some help from a trustworthy guy instead of stepping into crime world. But a major point which can't be neglected is 'dark society'. In a place where this Joker tries to spread joy and happiness has got him only kicks and punches not just on his body but on his inner self, too. This wounded him deeply. This filled his life with loads of pain, depression, mental disorder and what not resulting in a 'serial killer' and 'chaos' all around. Society can't be blamed always. Both society and the victim should be blamed. Both society and victim should vomit all the darkness.<br/><br/>Ending with my single line thought:
What society need is good heart to understand and love each other. What victim need is love and warmth hug from the society.<br/><br/>joaquin phoenix, lead actor of this movie, wore the role as his own skin. "
175," When you hear claps then you know it is amazing!
"," So it literally blew me off...phoenix has given something to cinema which was missing from a long long time!!
The movie got released today, and imagine a theatre full of people (in india) and clapping during the film means it deserves every applause.. "
176," Jaw-dropping film, Joaquin Phoenix ascends to GOAT status
"," 10/10. The direction, the cinematography, the score, the overall acting and tone. This movie would have been great based on that alone, but the protagonist brings something never seen before on stage. I have watched almost everything there is to see, and I had never seen a performance like Phoenix's. Words can't really do it justice. Must watch. Oh and by the way, apparently, it is a comic-book movie. Not that you can tell by watching. "
177," Defenantly second actor to get an oscar from the joker, a dark masterpiece
"," This Is without a doubt the best protryal of the joker, the way he slowly gets turned by society and becomes skinnier and crazier,defenanrly one of the if not the best movie of 2019 "
178," Utterly Brilliant acting
", Joaquin nailed the joker character. Who would act so well without becoming one? The transformation is remarkable and leaves an image in me. Could not get the beat off from me. 
179," Led by a stunning Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is an instant classic
",
180," One character, one movie and more substance than the whole MCU
", Phoenix provides the best acting ever. It's not the movie of the it's the movie of the DECADE. 
181," I know the reasons why you wouldn't like this film.
"," The problem with this movie is that it is too real. Maybe way too real for some people to absorb. Maybe it scares them, maybe it intimidates them, maybe it sickens them, maybe they are forced to see some things that they are not ready to see or forced to believe some things they are not ready to believe. But not for a moment does it change the fact that it is REAL.<br/><br/>This Joker IS NOT your typical 1st gen or 2nd gen Comic Book villain. This film does not follow your typical MCU, DC adaptations of Comics. This is no adaptation of anything you've read. There are no CGI effects. No half hour long fight sequences. No alien races coming to help. There isn't even a Batman to this Joker. This joker doesn't birth from a chemical accident, but rather from the conscious actions of a cruel society to a point where you have to make your imaginery comfort zone... then losing that too.<br/><br/>The loneliness, the darkness, the emotions, the fall from grace so beautifully captured that it haunts you. The fall in darkness so black it upsets you. It poses questions that hurt your conscience... answers to which you would rather avoid.<br/><br/>You can't watch it, and he lived it. And that is Joaquin's Joker... a monster made by YOU. "
182," A true ""kino"" experience; the most revolutionary and subversive film since Fight Club
",
183," Amazing movie
", This movie gave me goosebumps and kept me on my toes for its entire duration. Joaquin Phoenix made me believe that he WAS the Joker himself which is actually insane. 
184," Masterpiece with an important message
"," Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we face today in the world. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated and what role we play in helping mentally ill people and how they're treated. The best part about Joker is that it never takes a position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is a surreal, out of body experience. Some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance where you don't even wanna blink while watching. And these are just my thoughts on the film, Either way, go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say. "
185," One of the Best Films I Have Seen in My Life!
"," One of the most amazing films that I have ever seen in my lifetime. Phoenix, De Niro, and the entire cast are fantastic. Phoenix's acting is ""off the hook"" amazing. Rarely have I ever left the movie theater mesmerized by what I just saw. I am just simply glad that I saw a masterpiece like that in my lifetime...and it proved to me that the film industry, one that has been sadly fixated on CGI and special effects, is still capable of making a film that can penetrate the soul of the audience with a great script and amazing acting. "
186," One of the greatest films. Period.
", I went in with high expectations and came out absolutely blown away. A timeless piece of cinema with one of the greatest acting performances of all time. 
187," Absolutely Fantastic
"," It's hard to believe someone doesn't understand the violence and the villain formation in this movie. The script doesn't try to make the idea of a redeemer violence it's a lunatic story, it touches in sensible points about human mind and our destructive behaviors. Transcendental, Joker is the truly villain, not just a purple guy snapping fingers. "
188," An amalgam of emotions
"," Joker takes you on an emotional, disturbing yet a magnificent journey. Joaquin Phoenix puts on another brilliant show and the greatest character continues to live on as the favorite super villian. "
189," The best joker actor
", What i saw was the best movie I've ever seen since long time 
190," Best Movie from DC so far
"," Finally DC movie who come with DC's DNA since Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, superb action from Phoenix and 'out of the box' plot, something that Marvel will struggle with.... "
191," What an amazing performance!
"," I can't find words to describe Phoenix performance, just amazing! What a movie "
192," The best movie of 2019
"," This movie is phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just play the Joker, he became the joker and the slow burn story was not boring if anything it was the perfect rendition of how the Joker came to be. So realistic that you feel bad for Arthur Fleck and you just wanna give him a hug. "
193," Masterpiece
"," This is an absolute must watch, it's a dark movie about the injustices of society "
194," This was mind blowing!
"," I have second thoughts before watching that movie. But after seeing that, absolutely amazing!
I'm sure Heath Ledger will give thumbs up in the sky!
And the actor should get an Oscar 100%!!
I recommend to watch you wont regret! "
195," Uncomfortable, disturbing, thought provoking. A must see.
"," Dark, uncomfortable, thought provoking film. Gritty, dirty, well observed cinematography. A commentary on our times, broken systems, abuse, lack of care; be it societal, physical, mental or pastoral. Owes much to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Takes Heath Ledger's Joker deeper and darker. All in all a fitting origins (back story or prequel, whatever) tale or stand alone movie. Complaints about violence? Meh, I've seen more in a Avengers movie...at least it has context.
We genuinely feel for the Joker, is he a misunderstood hero, a figurehead for a anarchic uprising or a monster?
Or is he what our uncaring, unpleasant society has created....?
There's more humanity in this film than the whole of the Nolan Batman franchise.
Does he save the girl on the train with his maniacal laughter distracting the abusers, not able to bear seeing another human abused or can he just not help it?
As he descends deeper into madness, seeking solace in his delusions, finding release in violent acts, you still empathise with him and despise what society forced him to be.
Watch this, love the streetscapes, colour palette, edgy soundtrack and fine method acting from Joaquin Phoenix - Oscar? Oh I think so. "
196," The Perfect Joker
"," Joaquin Phoenix's acting is heartbreaking and horrifying; he gives a tremendously physical performance and it is easily up there as one of his best.<br/><br/>I found the film astounding: the cinematography is beautiful, the pacing is flawless, the tension builds to breaking point. The whole film comes together brilliantly in a character study that is so believable and gritty that I held my breath the whole way through.<br/><br/>I know this review is coming across as gushing, but honestly I cannot imagine how the character could have been portrayed any better. It might be my favourite Batman movie to date, and the Batman is not even in it! I hope this movie is a taste of things to come for the franchise; it makes the Marvel universe look trivial and childish. "
197," Best movie this year so far
"," I was so hype after the trailer, and kinda expecting to be disappointed because DC you khow... but well it turn out even better than what the trailer had shown, and im grad its.
The acting in this movie is too good, hat off to the new joker Joaquin Phoenix. He deserved an oscar for this act.
The story line is still kinda classic joker's but its darker and a lot more twist, i cant count how many time i almost jump off my sit by suprise and excitement.
And there is sooo many dark joke... i love it. "
198," Can you introduce me as JOKER?
"," Critics have just spoken. ""JOKER"" is already the ""#1 Movie in the Whole DC Universe"". It's an ""incredible DC film to watch"", Joker is now the ""Winner Golden Lion Best Film 76 Venice Film Festival"" ""Joaquin Phoenix is Astonishing"", it's ""Exhilarating"" ""A Masterpiece"", ""A Wild Card"", ""10/10"" ""Five Stars"" and it's now the ""#1 wining Major Oscar Buzz, at the Box Office, for the Best Joaquin Phoenix's Joker"", and Todd Phillips just dominated Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". This is why you go to the movies, and put a smile on your happy faces to enjoy. "
199," Joaquin deserves the Oscar
", The best movie of this year. The best Joker I have ever seen. Very realistic 
200," Joaquin Phoenix delivers but the story doesn't
"," While I enjoyed the film, it felt pretty short. When ""The End"" appeared on the screen I couldn't help but think - ""That's it?""<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic with his new take on the Joker, and it's mesmerizing to see his facial expressions keep changing. And his Joker laugh is unique - sinister and full of Joker's madness.<br/><br/>However despite some minor plot twists, most of interesting bits in the film have already been shown in the trailers. Don't expect much action like in The Dark Knight trilogy. Despite the much hyped gun violence, there are less guns in this movie than in any other Batman flick.<br/><br/>This is not a bad film, but it's not a great one either. Watch it only for Joaquin's performance. "
201," joker was best movie ever
"," Cinematography and acting was perfect , and they story depend on personal perception , it will get deep in your soul if you put your self in arthur situation . "
202," DC's masterpiece. Although a huge risk for the studio -- it paid of. A lot.
",
203," 10/10
"," The Joker won. Absolutely tremendous, what acting skills are we talking about ? It is amazing! "
204," Uncomfortable,Disturbing,Genius!
"," I haven't sat through the entire credits in stunned silence since ''let the right one in"" baring no resemblance to this movie whatsoever I was left completely speechless as to what I'd just witnessed. The term masterpiece is thrown around alot these days but Jaquin's nailed on performance of one of society's forgotton tormented souls that inevitabley arcs into the fragile but brutal criminal psychopath we know as the joker is understatedley 'perfect' to a level where the viewer is left to almost encourage Aurthur's inevitable wrong doings and sucker you into morally second guessing yourself with 'is he actually doing wrong?'
I could go on but there are many other reviews for you to read that will say everything I would have said about the cinematography, music, sound,direction,set pieces, un-nerving tension, the violence, the twists and every other reason we love movies which Joker pulls off so so well.
If you've not already booked to see it just drop what your doing and book.
Just dont expect a superhero movie. "
205," Finally a movie THATS REAL! LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH I HAD TO REVIEW. WHICH I HAVE NEVER DONE!!!! EPIC
", AMAZING üòç GENIUS!! A REAL MOVIE. WILL WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
206," SOLID! But don't believe the hype...
"," Joaquin Phoenix's performance is excellent, but the film is flawed, the main offenders being a second act twist that's visible a mile away and a small scene during the ending that feels tacked on.<br/><br/>However, you should see this film at least once. "
207," This is not just a movie, it's a mental exercise!
"," I went in the movie expecting a basic/ straight forward origin story of the joker and how he would fit in this universe Gotham. But I got something else, an experience like never before from a comic book film. After the first watch I couldn't grasp everything, but after watching it for the third time, there are so many things happening that you would not even think of are happening, or ask yourself are they even real? The more you watch this film the more it grows on you, maks you think about the reality. The movie doesn't end on a straight forward conclusion, but keeps the mystery intact, and is open to interpretation. My take on this one is that, this movie is not about the joker which we know from the comics and live action movies, but it's about a man who impregnated this chaos in Gotham which led to hundreds of followers from which the real joker was born who became the arch nemesis of the batman. Joker is not about who is behind the mask but about the chaos which still passes down and is beyond his death. "
208," People get this movie all wrong
"," You're not supposed to relate to the Joker!
You're meant to realise that some people are in pain. That people that act strangely should not be mocked, their life might have been horrific.
Be kinder, be more tolerant. Don't help create a real life Joker. "
209," Flawless
"," I couldn't find a negative thing about this movie.
It's bold and brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I have ever seen.
You have to go and see this. The only reason it has negative reviews is because some people were expecting another superhero movie with action - thank god it's not. "
210," Joker movie we deserve
"," Amazing acting from Phoenix!!! Absolutely solid performance. The score was equally incredible. My only complaint was there was a lot of build up time to becoming Joker, not a lot of Joker time. I understand this is an origin story, I just feel that I wanted a bit more in the end. But all in all amazing movie, you must go see it! "
211," Best Acting Performance of the decade !
"," I'm mesmerised , overwhelmed by the sheer beauty of Joaquin's Acting. The best cinematic experience I hve had in a long time. So glad I watched this in theatre. "
212," All It Takes Is One Bad Day!
",
213," ""Did you ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?""
", My only issue with the movie is the lack of this line 
214," Fantastic movie
"," Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian has got be the worst film critic on the planet!
How did he ever get a job doing this.
He is clueless.
Ignore his review .
This is a brilliant piece of film making "
215," Speechless!! I cried!! Joaquin = Heath
", At loss of words. Legacy of Heath has continued finally someone picked up where he left. Wow what a performance. I can still hear the laugh. 
216," Masterpiece!!!
"," This film is definitely a masterpiece. This is probably the most realistic film I've seen since The Dark Knight. The color grading, the soundtracks, the costumes, and overall EVERYTHING is phenomenal. Truly an Oscar Worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, and others. This film mainly depicts on mental illness, rich vs poor, and what would happen to a person if society doesn't treat him/her well. NO JOKE YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS FILM!!! "
217," Crazy Good Story
"," Joker was not only a fantastic story that was filled with emotion and intensity, it also portrayed mental illness as something that should be taken care of in the real world. When you watch Joker he does all these crazy things in the movie but the story isn't necessarily telling us to forgive him for his acts but more or less understanding him for what he did.<br/><br/>The story was so well put with emotion and heart breaking agony for the main character and joker made it seem as if he couldn't take it anymore. Phoenix took his acting to a whole other level for this film and him and this film definitely deserves an Oscar "
218," A classic master piece already!
"," Words don't do justice to describe the amazing script, dialogues, story and superb acting in this movie. I am not going to bore your or steal the thunder of the movie with a long review, but let me tell you so far what you know through the teasers and trailers is simply the tip of the iceberg. There is a bigger arch and captivating story in this movie. I just watched the movie, and I am definitely going to watch it at least couple of more times before it is taken off the big screens. "
219," Anti-hero main characters have never been this good (to be bad)
"," This is an origin story of a famous superhero villain, and not quite. You don't need to have extensive knowledge on all the lore of DC supers because Joker is a fresh new take on the very popular character. It is a film with an anti-hero protagonist, and an anti-superhero in terms of its overall tone. I must say, it is storytelling at its finest. "
220," The other side of a pretty dark coin
"," Well, this was certainly quite an anticipated movie, and just to think that it was made by the guy that came up with The Hangover. Then again this film is certainly not a pleasant movie by no means, but that certainly does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Yeah, it is meant to make you feel really uncomfortable, and in a way you sort of also feel a lot of sympathy for the main character. In a way, by the end of the film, I am really wanting him to actually become the Joker, though of course this is all left in Limbo with the way the ending actually comes about.<br/><br/>One thing I have to say is that Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely outstanding. I remember people suggesting that nobody could ever top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker, and of course there was Jared Leno who came along with Suicide Squad, yet Joaquin Phoenix truly moves this character to a completely new level. Yeah, we all suspected that the Joker was crazy, but the way Phoenix captures the dark insanity of the character, the way he captures his mental illness, is absolutely outstanding.<br/><br/>Thus, what begs the question is, could he actually be the Joker that we all know and love (and if it wasn't for the fact that the Joker is a much loved villain we wouldn't have got this movie - in fact I'm not at all sure if there is any other villian out there that could literally have a movie of their own). The reason I say this is because Phoenix's Joker is seriously disabled, yet when we encounter the Joker elsewhere, while he might pretend to be crazy, he all know that he has his wits about him.<br/><br/>The thing is that I don't believe that Phoenix's Joker could actually be the 'clown-prince of crime' because, well, I'm not entirely sure whether he is actually capable of interacting with people, let alone being the calculating criminal that he is famous for. The reason is that he really doesn't seem to be capable of being able to interact with people. In fact, he is more of a symbol, this is something that slowly becomes relevant as the movie progresses, until we get to the end. Of course, the ending is very ambiguous, and some of the suggestions that he is a joker as opposed to The Joker, really doesn't sit with me all that well.<br/><br/>However, in a way it sort of makes sense, him being a symbol and all that. One suggestion, and it is a suggestion that I sort can agree with, is that he actually died in the car crash (something that isn't all that surprising considering he was hit by an ambulance on the side of the car in which he was sitting), and the crowds removed him carefully, as if he was some sort of martyr. Sure, the final scene certainly doesn't suggest that he is in heaven or anything, but the thing is that many characters literally take on a force of personality, one in which the actual person could never fulfill, and Arthur is certainly no leader, not in that sense of the word, and as such he can really only exist as a symbol.<br/><br/>Yet we must remember that there is so much about this film that we simply do not know what is truth and what is hallucination. The thing is that Arthur is seriously disconnected from reality, that becomes pretty clear with the 'relationship' that he has with the woman down the hallway. Yeah, once that becomes clear, and it should not have been any surprise as all, it really throws into a lot of doubts what is actually happening, what is real and what is not. Then again, there are a lot of scenes going on in the background, which do give us hints that there certainly is a reality that is unfolding, which means that he certainly did kill the three men on the subway, and murdered Murray live on national television.<br/><br/>Yet even Thomas Wayne, a character that is certainly not held in such high regard in this film, has an ambiguous side to him. Then again, in the other Batman films, we see so little of the character that he is seen as some angelic figure. Yet in this film, once again, the truth, and the reality, are two completely different things. Still, the whole question of whether he did have an affair with Arthur's mother, and that Arthur is actually his illegitimate son, is certainly thrown into a lot of doubt.<br/><br/>So, yeah, this is a pretty awesome film, and it is certainly one of those films that is going to leave you thinking and trying to understand it for quite a while after leaving the cinema. Honestly, it is pretty good that we are starting to see more of these movies come into the cinema now, after a very long drought full of a bunch of quite sub-par action flicks. "
221," Character Study in the tone of Taxi Driver
", This was a wonderful study of the what could be behind the Joker. It is also a great commentary on our society and times and how the Media and the 1% create all of the problems that the rest of us are expected to deal with. Thomas Wayne is a great representation of the elite political class and how they think they know what is best for everyone. 
222," Certainly not Jack's ""Joker"" or even Heath's still an excellent and dark artistic performance from Joaquin that had my face smiling and that's life!
",
223," Phoenix is the same level as Ledger
"," Phoenix fitted so we'll in his role as The Joker, reminded me of Health Ledger. "
224," Its not a film its Art
", It would take me hours to describe my feelings for this movie.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema expecting to see a great performance from Phoenix...but...it wasnt just him....Everything was great the story the music the photography directing...Phoenix will win the oscar (im sorry for the rest of the contestants)..<br/><br/>Everything is just WOW about him ...what a great movie ...<br/><br/>Just a reminder to Hollywood that a great script with a great acting has no need of special effects or cgi or action scenes or whatever to make the top...Go back to movies like that ..make sure the story is good and the acting is good and forget about the rest<br/><br/>Congraz to everyone for that masterpiece...and we the viewers thank you! 
225," The best movie I never want to see again!
"," Let's just get this straight......if Joaquin Phoenix does not win an Oscar for this performance than there is something wrong in the world. As for the movie? Disturbing, thought provoking, fascinating, inciteful and just brilliant. A comic book movie that's not a comic book movie. I never thought Heath Ledger's performance as the joker could be matched but Phoenix's version is simply outstanding. "
226," Amazing!!
"," This movie is absolutely amazing!! Those giving it a bad review obviously have no clue what an origin movie is about. It is slow at first but obviously it's gotta work it's way up by telling us the story of how he became. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't disappoint in this movie, he nailed the role. I loved every bit of it. "
227," Mesmerizing!
"," Joaquin""s performance was over the top perfection. Want 2 C it again for things I missed!
OSCAR...absolutely! Amazing! "
228," Cinematic masterpiece - Best movie I've seen this year!
"," Firstly if you are a cinema fan and appreciate the way a story unfolds; camera angles; character development then GO and see this movie! You will enjoy it immensely.
Now I had high hopes for this movie. Phoenix is an incredible actor and all the early reviews looked great. What I wasn't prepared for was the emotional connection I had with such a dark piece of film. The way you are drawn in as a viewer to the plight of Joker's character is fantastic. The set created a real feel to a 'comic' movie which is often missing. The story is actually close to the bone when you look at modern society; this only adds to the brutality. Fantastic film with all the right elements and casting. You will hear people say this movie is too dark but that is the exact reason the movie works so well. I would be surprised if Phoenix was denied an Oscar nod. I would say this is the best movie of 2019 so far. Bravo to the team behind JOKER. "
229," WOW!
"," I always thought of Joker as a evil demonic clown who loves terrorizing people to get his rocks off.And I always wanted to see a really cool back story for him to see what turned him evil but this just blew me away.never ever has a movies protagonist/antagonist made me feel so weird inside how is it it possible someone can be so evil and yet we can sympathize with him ,such a weird feeling I can't stop thinking of it.Brilliant cinematography ,score ,acting ,story ,twists &amp; everything.10/10 "
230," Do you want to hear a joke?
"," Growing up I've seen all the iterations of the Joker character. From small screen to big screen. All of them are unique in their own way. Don't compare Phoenix to Ledger as the two Jokers are simply two different interpretations of the same concept. This is the story of the Joker from the inside out. There are no punchlines, no gimmicks and no silver lining. There is no hero in this film. This is a study on the concept of the Joker and how he became who he is. This movie is dark, terrifying, introspective and raw. Phoenix simply disappears in his role and you never wonder where he went. Everyone knows that the Joker is insane but never have we ever seen inside his mind like we do here. From top to bottom this film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Phoenix has already won the best actor Oscar. It's just a matter of time before they hand it to him. "
231," Epic Movie,Don't listen anybody's words just watch and enjoy
"," Joaquine Phoenix is a Gem when comes to this joker act,he definitely deserves Oscar award for this movie must watch movie "
232," One word: masterpiece!
"," I truely hope Joaquin Phoenix wins an oscar for this.
What an incredible performance.
The movie has a very dark atmosphere from the beginning til the end.
You also sympathize with the joker, you feel sorry for him.
This is not a hype, this is a masterpiece. Go and watch. "
233," Deeply Unsettling
",
234," AMAZING!
", The best film I've seen in a long time! Absolute amazing!!! Definitely recommend to go &amp; see it! Would definitely go &amp; see it again! 
235," Send in the clown...
", Is anything real or is nothing real... as he descends into madness he has more and more intense psychotic visions... is any of it real? Or is everything just the inside of a psychopaths mind... I don't think any amount of deciphering of this movie will be able to understand it. Thats why it is possibly the greatest movie ever made. 10/10 is a low score... ha.. ha hahahah 
236," People don't understand it.
"," Some people say that it is too dark for their likings, and made them uncomfortable. That's the point of the movie. It let's you litterly stand in the shoes of a mentally ill man. If you don't understand the movie then you should probably not even review it because if you missed the movie's mark all what will come out of your mouth is bull bull. "
237," Masterpiece.
", I'm 47. I've been around. I've been to the cinema a LOT. Never been to see a film twice though. Joker I've seen 3 times it is THAT good. Well to me anyway. 
238," The Perfect Storm portrayal of American society
"," A country that makes mental health care treatment unaffordable to the poor (great surprise many of them are...), and blames poor people for being unsuccessful, thereby pushing them to the edges of society. Add to that the second amendment and handing out assault riffles to anyone, and there you have it The Perfect Storm.<br/><br/>The most symbolic scene in my opinion is when the Joker puts a gun to his head and we see his face painted in red white and blue...<br/><br/>An important movie, that will hopefully emphasize the problem, paving a way for a solution. "
239," Why do so many critics hate this movie?
"," It's beyond me why so many critics have panned and even encouraged people to skip this picture. I'm not exactly sure of why the vendetta's so personal; it's obviously struck a nerve . I'm taking critics less and less seriously since they rave about tripe like 'Lady Bird"" while trying to bludgeon a masterpiece like 'Joker'. This is the first ten I recall ever giving to a movie. "
240," #!%! Bruce Wayne!!!
", Thank goodness I didn't bring my little one with me. Me and my older kids enjoyed it. This movie is very dark and violent. One of the best prequels I have ever seen. Mr. Phoenix really deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. This one of my top two movies this year. Almost two and a half hours long but worth it! 
241," Amazing!
"," What an actor! Absolutely brilliant, loved it ! An Oscar winning performance for sure ! "
242," No punchline
", Cause it's not a joke.<br/><br/>Marvel fanboy is crying right now 
243," A true masterpiece!
"," I'm not a fan of Batman movies but went to see this with my teenage son. It's truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have never felt a movie to be PERFECT, but this movie truly I s. They just don't make movies like this anymore with the perfect story, script, cinematography, score, acting! It will be revered as a cinematic masterpiece.
And I do appreciate the political statement it's making. It's not condoning violence. It's trying to reveal what harm mental illness which is ignored by society and even bullied and ridiculed can do.
Just saw it for a second time tonight! Will watch again! "
244," Is there any way to rate this movie more than 10 stars?
"," What can I say? This movie speaks for itself. It's amazing, it's mesmerizing, it's dark, it's brutal, it's the best movie of 2019 hands down. At first we see the sufferings of the main character Arthur Fleck. Then we see his journey into madness and accepting his identity, Joker. The ending was magnificent. It's a movie you just have to see to experience how good it actually is. "
245," Masterpiece
", In a time of over saturated comic book movies it's a beautiful irony that this is the film currently attempting to push boundaries in the genre and break out of the comedy infused entertainment formula we have had for the last decade is the one film about a clown. 
246," If anyone is deserving of an Oscar, it's Joaquin Phoenix
"," Even if you are not a fan of dark, psychological thrillers, there is no denying that Phoenix has set a whole new standard for the acting world. Phoenix portrays the joker like never before, leaving the audience to pity the character. I have seen the movie twice since it's release date on Friday, and can say with confidence that it is an instant classic for sure. It opens up new doors for film and actors. Arguably the best acting of the past decade. "
247," Nothing short of a performance of a lifetime
"," Wow just wow, I was skeptical going in thinking anyone would come close to ledger or hamills jokers, but this THIS is nothing short of a performance of a lifetime by phoenix, he has BLOWN ME AWAY! "
248," An Epic movie for a Legendary villian
", A movie worthy of an oscar. One of the best movie in superhero genre since The Dark Knight. Phoenix is the actor who was born for this role after Ledger. 
249," Dangerously uncomfortable,
"," One of the most brilliant acting performances I have seen this year. Joaquin makes sure every eye is turned squarely on him, whether in the story or in the theater. You find yourself empathizing with Anthony in the first third, with the world against him, being kicked by young boys in the very first sequence, to losing his job. He's a nobody, and you feel for him. This starts to unravel in the next third, where you're struggling to find justification for why you sympathized with him, and the last part hits you hard, making a fool out of you for trying to justify a violent dangerous man's actions.
Joker is a masterpiece, carefully balancing Anthony's everyday actions with an almost eerie background score warning you of potential danger that lies ahead. It shows the destruction of a man into a new entity, who is remorseless, broken, dangerous and unpredictable- the Joker.
I loved the portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a typical rich businessman, and not the hero we're led to believe with the previous films, was brilliant, because the movie is from the point of view of a lonely lowly man like Anthony. I also loved the interaction between Bruce Wayne and Anthony, you could see the hunger and jealousy and the resentment in the eyes of Anthony when he talked to Bruce, believing that Bruce's life could have been his.
I love the parallel of showing how Bruce's innocent life ended with his parent's lives, and at the same time, Anthony's life too ended, in a way, by him fully accepting the Joker persona.
The movie is one of the best there is, without the use of CGI, without it being 3D, it's just a trodden man's descent into madness that is shown masterfully. Superhero/Origin Story fatigued? This breaks the shackles.
PS. Joaquin has played the Joker better than Heath Ledger, and this is the highest compliment I can give him. "
250," Joaquin pheonix as the Joker an Absolute Masterpiece!!!!
"," As an DC fanboy lost hope on DC when they made JL, but i eventually started going back to the cinemas after Wonderwomen and Aquaman. When The Joker film was announced as Joaquin pheonix in the lead i must say i had my doubts. I was pretty sure noone could even match Heath ledger's Joker.. I was wrong. This might be the best DC film ever made! Joaquin pheonix did the impossible. Mindblowing performance as the joker! The best after Heath Ledger! Movie of the year! The laughs, screams, craziness and the dark psychological sufferings of the Joker will haunt you for the rest of the year. I must say The Joker is back! Trust me on this!
9/10 on this one!<br/><br/>P.S This is my second 9/10 for a DC movie after TDK. "
251," That's life
"," Such an incredible reimagining of a fan favorite classic supervillain. This movie is set in the 80s but consistently feels like present times, which is a triumph in itself. Joaquin Phoenix again cements his immense range and talent as he completely absorbs the audience with his commitment to the character. Director Todd Phillips also proves once and for all that he too has a wide range of talent as a director and can take his films to the next level.
<ul><li>Astonishingly beautiful score written</li><li>Completly grasping and thrilling plot</li><li>Thought provoking message about mental health and the underprivileged in this country.</li></ul><br/><br/>10/10 Would Highly Reccomend "
252," Don't listen to critics. Great Movie!!
"," Out of this whole year I have never watched a movie that played with my emotions quite like this film. Joker is a character study on one of the most famous villains in the dc comics but this film is not what you expect. It's more of a story of a man who has a mental illness and just keeps going to the more extreme side of insanity. This movie does that so well and Joaquin Phoenix has one of the best performances of this year and deserves on Oscar. Robert De Niro, though having a small role, has an amazing performance as well. The story is very much inspired from taxi driver but is very different as well. This is a much watch movie for any person comic fan or not. MUST WATCH AMAZING MOVIE!!!! "
253," Salute to Joachim Phoenix
", Joachim Phoenix is the best. how can someone act so good. just speechless. 
254," A comic film so real it feels imaginary
"," As heath ledger's joker said ""madness is like gravity all you need is a push"" Joaquin through his performance has proved it. Through the movie one will witness the fall of a man and the rise of the Joker. Brilliant performance by Joaquin. "
255," A MASTERPIECE üíØ
", This joker Standalone movie is a Masterpiece and the acting of Joaquin Pheonix makes it Oscar Worthy. I think it would be unfair if this movie and Joaquin doesn't gets the oscar. 
256," So real it's uncomfortable
"," This movie is depressing, brilliant and so real it's uncomfortable to watch. That being said, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting I have ever seen and this movie delivers a very realistic look at how the unfortunate, mentally ill, weak and awkward live as well as how they are treated. By the end of this movie, I found myself actually cheering for The Joker fueled by the compassion and sorrow I had for his hardships and the lack of support he sustained from a society that not only failed him but made it clear that no one really cares. It leaves you with the realization that yep, this is the world we live in, the real world, where the rich and privileged rule. I wanted The Joker to make his official appearance and cause an uprising of people who are so sick of being ignored and treated like dirt that they find a hero from a crazy, violent, broken man. This movie does not hold back, it comes at you full force and stirs emotions that are confusing. We're not supposed to cheer for the villain. But then, who is actually the villain? "
257," WOW!!!
"," Best DC/Marvel movie by a mile! Best Dark movie ever! Phoenix's performance as good as I've ever seen! If he doesn't win the Oscar then the Oscars are a Joke (pun intended)! OK, some parts are predictable but who cares! Too good to miss. Takes Dark to a whole new blacker level! A must see Masterpiece!! "
258," WHAT A MOVIE! One of the best movies ever!!!!
"," That movie got me like no other has ever had. I couldn't even breath at some parts. What a great actor, what a great story. The movie was only started for 10 minutes and I was already like ""WHAT A GREAT ACTOR"". I've missed movies like this. You can't get distracted by anything while watching this movie, is just amazing. Have no words. What a movie... INCREDIBLE! Give that man an Oscar, please!!!! "
259," Critics = Idiots
"," Before talking about the movie, I must first say that movie critics are absolute airheads. Unless a film has a happy plot and positive message you can almost guarantee that it will get bashed by multiple critics. IMBD is the only rating you should go by because it is based on us the people and not some idiotic judgement by a pompous critic. Anyways enough of that, this movie is absolutely amazing! Everything from the acting, music score, and setting is none short of perfection. Joaquin Phoenix has set a new standard for acting and if he does not win an Oscar for this then the movie industry is doomed. I felt every emotion that he worked so hard on to display to an audience. Which I must applaud because the level of dedication displayed here deserves to recognized. I won't spoil any of the movie but, I will say to just go see it! You will not be disappointed!<br/><br/>10/10 - I apologize for being blunt but if you are rating this low. Then stay off this page and stick to your brainless (new MIB, Oceans, Ghostbusters etc. ) movies filled with CGI crap! "
260," People Severely Missunderstand What This Movie Is About
",
261," Masterpiece not a movie
"," This. Was. Simply. BRILLIANT! Everything seemed so well thought out, so remarkably executed and so on... Would love to go and see this movie once again for sure. "
262," Brilliant
"," Hauntingly Brilliant , a hard watch at times as Athur struggles through a torturous life.
The Brilliant soundtrack and Dark tone of the film which all DC films should have makes it easily slot in as a prequel to Christopher Nolan .. The Dark Knight
Time line would be out or would it ? Depending how you explain the ending "
263," 'I'm an Agent of Chaos'
"," Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is undisputedly going to win an Academy award for his performance. The way this film deals with the central character and the plot is brilliant. It may seem to glamorize mental illness or gun violence but this is a Joker origin story, Batman's nemesis and we see his story unfold with his very own eyes and the movie succeeds to do so.<br/><br/>You can feel the pain he goes through trying to survive in this cruel and dark world and what laughing at wrong things can do to a person. We're not supposed to sympathize with such a person but you can't help feel sorry for what he's been through and what goes in his mind. There are really tense moments in the film along with moments of relief and solace.<br/><br/>The people of Gotham were already fed up with the elite and rich. The way things turn out by the end of the movie reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker line 'I'm an agent of chaos' and that's certainly what happened. He aggravated the people, introduced anarchy and total chaos. Being very authentic to the character of Joker.<br/><br/>The score is just perfect, it tries to capture the loneliness when a mentally-ill person gets thrown away by society and the descent that follows later. The visuals, lighting and cinematography couldn't be more well suited for the theme of the movie. It feels kind of liberating what a person can achieve and disrupt the persistent nature of individuals, make them see true their colors no longer held accountable by society or the rules and go haywire. This movie as a Joker origin story is nothing less than flawless and phenomenal. "
264," An amazing movie in the overly commercialized industry
", This is my first time ever writing s comment and this definitely worths a 10. The story is told in a such a contradictory way that can be so touching at the same time. 
265," The upcoming Oscar winner
"," This movie will earn Oscar best Actor.
My concern is this movie makes you feel sorrow for the criminals.:) "
266," Unmatched performance!
", Absolutely stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Joker is so realistic and gripping. Emotions overload. 
267," Exceeded expectation by FAR
"," Going into the theater I already had a very high expectation, but it was no where close to how good this movie and the acting actually is.... This movie is an art piece. "
268," Amazing Movie
"," Very good movie. The first half of the movie was slow, but second half was amazing "
269," Best movie in past couple of years
"," It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The dark, tragic and well planned development of an innocent lonely man towards a brave symbol of awareness, resistance and revolution. Editing, soundtracks and direction was brilliant and breathtaking. "
270," Just amazing
", Do I have to say more? It's everything I thought it would be. This is tye jest movie of 2019. 
271," This is not some brain dead action movie this is a masterpiece!
", My expectations for this movie weren't very high (DC just has been lacking lately) but man this movie is a masterpiece that has to been seen by all. 
272," Just give Mr. Phoenix all the awards for 2019.
", I don't need to elaborate more - A masterpiece performance to the highest order. This is psychologically revolutionary portrayal of a deranged character. 
273," A Masterpiece
"," An epic masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix gives his best performance ever. Best comic movie ever and also one of the most favorite movie, loved it. "
274," A political incorrect movie
", A political incorrect movie but it real happen everywhere and everyday! The best movie this year. 
275," one of the best movies of all time
"," This is my first review on this site and I must say 10/10
Just saw it a while ago. No words to describe the phoemix¬¥s job
Yes! Its one of the best movies of all time
and the oscar goes to.... "
276," Phenomenal
"," Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen, and will see again...I enjoyed every twist, turn, and the furthering of the evolution of the character and the slow and drastic turn to violence and chaos at a whim. Fantastic movie! "
277," If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this, We confirm that the whole industry is fake!
"," This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC. "
278," Good acting.... Disappointing over all film
"," Brilliant acting for this film, found myself I was waiting for something to happen, get the message about mental health and how bad the system is, but something missing for me "
279," Absolutely not a 10
"," Strong fanboy and hype rush going on.
The movie is good don't get me wrong, the cinematography is amazing, the acting is brilliant, but the story is a bit predictable if you have an iq above 90. Its also really slow paced which can be annoying at times. Deff has it flaws and is in no way even comparable to Batman the dark knight. The movie is a 7 but I gave it a 6 to compensate for all the fanboy 10s "
280," Great portrayal of joker but a slow film and overhyped
"," Some great moments, doesn't really live up to the hype though.
Phoenix's prediction of Joker's descent into madness was really interesting to watch and he will get many plaudits but the film felt like it was missing something. A few plot holes and areas where you feel like it's being dragged out longer than it needs to be. Definitely worth a watch, but don't go in expecting to see a 'film of the year'.
Ledger still on top. "
281," Greatest movie of ALL TIME!
", What a performance by Joaquin. The way they build the character is mind blowing! Loved Heath Ledger but Joaquin has actually outdone him here... 
282," This movie is for woke people
"," Not for noobs,
Pros are cordially invited.
The movie is based on the reality and the truth. "
283," Don't listen to critics
"," It's pretty apparent the modern generation of critics are here to pader to big dumb billion dollar movies. This is an excellent take on the joker and keeps its focus on a mentally ill mans fall into absolute madness. Its dark and requires attention to follow the plot. Unlike your majority modern movies which tend focus on CGI and explosions with brief plot overviews. It also doesn't try to tick boxes to appease the 1%. It focuses on mental illness and the joker. No LGBTQ, Racism, Gun Control, Police Brutality, Women's issues etc... "
284," A true Masterpiece better than any MCU film
"," A engaging story, some splendid cinematography, stellar acting. Joaquin Phoenix gave the best performance as a villain since Heath Ledger as Joker. A true Masterpiece "
285," Incredible, just incredible
"," Few modern, mainstream films today can be considered art, but this breaks the mould.<br/><br/>I spent the first two thirds of this film in tears, it provoked a very painful reaction from me. Society, in particular, the worst parts of our society, were represented in an extreme way, nonetheless it did depict how we treat each other and especially how we treat people that are different to us.<br/><br/>By the time Joker was unleashed, I was actually glad that he felt freed, confident and enacting his revenge on some of the worst people imaginable. By the end of the movie, I was rooting for him. Very odd given the things he was doing.<br/><br/>The way in which this film was shot is mesmerising, the cinematography, score and Joaquin's acting are flawless. The film retains the comic book feel but is very real.<br/><br/>I've said several times that no interpretation of Joker could eclipse Heath Ledger's, but Joaquin is just next level, some of the best acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Joker is a masterpiece. "
286," Best of all time...
", Full of emotions and performance of actor is world class definitely Oscar getting movie 
287," Best of the best
"," An.outstanding performance from Joaquin Phoenix, serious masterpiece, a beautiful soundtrack, quality scenes. The best movie of the year and one of the bests of all time "
288," Salute to the Joker!!
"," Dazzling performance, every moment shown can be happening to so many of us. Nerve breaking acting. This movie will remain one of my favorite for ever. Everyone needs some importance in life. Thank you for making it so real. "
289," What do you get when you cross a brilliant actor, a meaningful movie and the best supervillain in comics?
",
290," Best Movie in 2019
", Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen 
291," Flawless masterpiece!!
", This is one of the best movies ever. What a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix (Oscar winner) Todd Philips is genius (Oscar winner). Everything about this movie is just perfect. 
292," Definitely worth seeing
"," Not only was this movie a masterpiece, but Joaquin Phoenix's acting is PHENOMENAL! Hands down the best movie on the year. Very dark and beautiful. Explosive and exciting. "
293," He made revolution by his smile , his jock and his mask
", It's a fantastic movie and deserve the Oscar prize 
294," Unreal
"," It's the best movie I've seen, at least in the last decade. It's the easily conceivable story of a man who has been abandoned by the system that is supposed to protect us from people like him. "
295," Definitely recommend
", Great movie. It is is the mind of a person with a mental illness. 
296," WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE
"," Where do I start with this.... the storyline, the acting, it was just incredible. Hats off to Todd Philips, he made all of us viewers jokers as well, cuz whenever he would do something that isn't right, we would get happy and laugh with him. This is one of its kind!! "
297," The start of something very special indeed...
", Possibly the best comic book character depiction ever put into film. You feel the transition coming through every scene in the film and the wait is amazingly worth it when the joker finally arrives. The scene on the steps when he's become the joker was spine tingling because you realise this really is the Joker that your watching in the flesh. If this is the only version of Phoenix as the joker I'll have to accept it but if they can replicate this quality into a sequel it will be spectacular. What a film! 
298," For the first time ever I will be returning to cinema to watch this again
"," I admit it. I did not expect much from this film. But my god It was a nice surprise! Positives is by far the transformation of joker from start of the film to the end. It's incredibly dark and probably too distressing for some people to watch. The violence happens now and then but each time makes a huge impact! The negatives are obvious the main one being of course the late heath ledger, he left quite a high bar to jump! I personally believe phoenix matches him and does jump that bar. People just need to realise this is a different actors approach and different take on a character from a different universe. The second negative is the one that got to me the most. I personally believe part of jokers charm is no one has a clue who he is where he's come from or how he got them scars. I did eventually accept the origin story of course and I ask other hardcore comic book fans to do the same. As once you pass this hurdle this does become one of the best films ever. I will be returning to the cinema to watch this again which Is a first for me. "
299," A Masterpiece
"," From the moment I watched the trailer I was intrigued by the portrayal of this Joker. I loved that they created a backstory for this villain, it made him human. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing, his performance throughout was astonishing, from contorting his body, to dancing, his glance very strong. I also loved the choice of his outfit (and colours) when dancing down the stairs, just perfect. The music, journal writings and silences were powerful. I cannot remember the last time I admired a movie this much. "
300," Amazing movie
"," 10/10 it is unfair for this movie because he deserve more
Special thanks for all the crew in the movie "
301," What a Performance
", JP is so good that it hurts watching this stellar Performance. I grew up reading DC and Batman in particular... this movie leaves me speechless and this Joker Origin is just perfect. I will cry myself to sleep tonight... 
302," Simply brilliant
",
303," Best ""superhero"" movie
"," I am reluctant to see ""superhero"" movies. I this case, I would see it again and again. Joaquin Phoenix is just an Oscar winner actor. "
304," Master-peace...
"," Guys just go and watch it in cinemas, this is a master-peace. I dont have any words to say, incredible work. Thank you. "
305," Well-crafted, tragic, and dark work of art
"," This is one of the movies that you watch and end up thinking about for a while after.
It's very rare that a movie makes you truly terrified and yet understanding of why this villain is the way he is.
The acting is absolutely incredible, hats off to Joaqin Phoenix for this legendary performance.
The soundtrack was haunting, eerie, and heavy. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's choice of using cello as the main instrument allowed for a very dark and churning sound that perfectly captures the turmoil inside of Arthur. Bravo!
The cinematography is breathtaking, the visuals are stunning, and combined with the meticulous directing and attention to detail, the final product ends up being a true masterpiece. "
306," In one sentence
"," This movie will make you sad, make you angry and maybe it'll make you a little bit crazy too. "
307," Over the top!
",
308," Brilliant!
", I was numb on the first half of the movie. Shouldn't have watched it because now I can't get over it. I will lose faith in humanity if Joaquin Phoenix is not winning Oscar for this. 
309," A movie not made for all
"," Ive been lucky to live and witness both Heath's and Joaquin's performance and till now the feeling is still surreal.<br/><br/>It started with a slow pace, detail by detail describing how Joker became. Story telling was superb as it covered every aspect of the film. In short every question was answered from the start till the finish.<br/><br/>I tell you this movie is not made for all. It is very dark and it will leave a mark on you when you finished it watching. An instant classic for me! "
310," You guys want another joke ?
"," What do you get when you cross a Perfect Actor and Excellent Director
I'll tell you what you get...
You get a Oscar worthy masterpiece! "
311," This time Oscar is definitely yours.
"," You finished a very great performance, I just want to say thank you Joaquin Phoenix!!! "
312," Powerful and emotional
"," I don't often write reviews for movies, but this film is just incredible. Joaquin plays the role better than anyone ever has, or ever could. You really do put yourself in Joker's shoes, feeling so many different emotions throughout. Joker exceeded my expectations in ways I didn't think possible. 10/10 performance! "
313," Be polite and kind to everyone.
"," The one lesson I learnt from this movie is only if he had one person whom he could his friend, Joker would have had something going for him.
Be nice to people, you might be the only one for a person. "
314," MASTERPIECE!!!
"," Love it, not a waste of time at all. Love the story, the acting,... everything is great and i CANT LET MY EYES OUT OF IT. "
315," I loved it.
"," The story is fast paced and the cinematography looked great. No unnatural dialogue, no fabricated bland romance - just awesome acting and a fascinating story. "
316," Very good movie
"," Well done, very well acted, good direction, good soundtrack, all in this movie works and its very interesting. Bravooooooo "
317," Masterpiece
"," The film introduce us the idea of the joker and it can be inspire be everyone who have a mental issue not you should fall in a chemical tank to become the joker, it's all it need just a little push "
318," Masterpiece
"," I'm not a fan of DC in fact I Watched most of marvel's movies (Marvel fan) But this Movie is different, The building of Joker's character was magnificent their was alot of references for Batman I think U shouldn't watch the Joker if you didn't watch batman Dark Knight Trilogy or if u not familiar with batman/Bruce wane Story.
This Movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen. "
319," Brilliant from start to finish!
"," I was super excited for this movie ever since I heard Joaquin Phoenix was playing the Joker, I was not disappointed. The best Joker portrayal to date in my opinion A++++ "
320," Masterpiece!
"," After 11 years, the legacy has been revived. Heath would be proud! "
321," The Greatest Joke Ever
"," I'm in awe.. Absolute awe. I just have no words. Joaquin Phoenix was born to play the Joker. The cinematography, soundtrack, acting, sets.. Everything was just pure cinema brilliance.<br/><br/>This movie is truly worthy of a sequel and it would be an absolute shame if Phoenix never played the part again. "
322," Outstanding writing and acting, phenomenal production design
"," Truly a masterpiece of filmmaking. I would without a doubt argue that Joaquin Phoenix holds one of the best performances of all time, this may even be the best performance I've ever witnessed in cinema. Truly truly a masterwork. People say it's violent but the world is violent, just most people who can afford to go to the movies are lucky enough that their bubble keeps the darker parts of the world out, but how long can we stay at such peace? Is the peace we hold real in the grand scheme of things? Or are we just fooling ourselves? "
323," Never ever seen before
"," Since 20 years am alive on this planet but to be true I have never seen any movie like this. This is a type of movie which comes once in every 50 years, it's a pure art depiction of how a mentally ill person lives and finds it's true self. For those who don't know this movie is not taken from the comics nor it is related to the Justice League universe. This is a fresh take on the Joker character. "
324," An easy oscar!!
"," One of the best movies I've seen my entire time , already watched twice and going for a third time next week "
325," Masterpiece at Last
"," I have just returned home from watching the Joker without reading any reviews or listening to comments prior too, what I have watched tonight is a cinematic triumph, I could go on to use all the usual clich√©s but I won't, I actually commented to my wife as we drove home claiming we have just watched a modern day classic, a film so well crafted visually that it is actually faultless, from style to gritty disturbing focuses on character creation to beautiful cinematography that leaves you both moved and uncomfortable but so glad you watched it in opening week. This film will be the topic of many a discussion for years to come Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising and equally the most disturbed Joker I have watched. Hoorah at last for something that's truly changed my opinion on modern film choices. But a huge congrats to those brave enough to endeavour in rebelling in film making in a world gone politically mad. "
326," Raw and Intense!
"," I must admit I was hesitant to see Joker on my own. I didn't know how I'd react to it knowing the film has sensitive material about mental illness. I braved it out anyway; I left the cinema shook!<br/><br/>The film was a raw and honest depiction of what a person with mental illness goes through. The line that hit home is one written in Arthur's journal: ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""<br/><br/>The film shows how society do not provide the resources for people with mental illnesses which make them turn into baddies. In reality, most would rather turn against themselves than to others. The film almost comments on how society fails to nurture people with mental illnesses.<br/><br/>Suffering from depression myself, I understand what Arthur is going through. That does not make his actions justified though. He is no hero; he is a confused man denied the care he badly needs.<br/><br/>I am lucky compared to Arthur, fortunate than most for getting the treatment I needed. I always had the support of friends, colleagues and family. Arthur isn't that fortunate which led him to spiral down to a bloody life of crime.<br/><br/>Joker is a brilliant film you would want to see from start to finish. Credit both for a superb acting from Joaquin Phoenix and a genuine and powerful story! "
327," Great
", I just love the way he acts the way he cries he is better than any joker 
328," A chilling masterpiece
"," Joaquin Phoenix is utterly phenomenal portraying the birth of Gotham's greatest villain, the Joker.
This is a story of man slowly losing faith in humanity to the point of madness. We get to know the Joker first as Arthur Fleck; a sad loner who isn't well liked because he makes people uncomfortable. He doesn't have friends, or a special someone in his life, only his mother who he still lives with and cares for. Arthur does the best that he can, working hard as a party clown but he is down on his luck and the world he lives in is brutal. On top of that his dream of becoming a comedian is shattered when talk show host Murray Franklin shows a clip of Arthur bombing at a comedy club. Meanwhile tension in Gotham has been mounting as the poor have been suffering and they turn their anger towards the rich, who seem completely indifferent to the struggles of those living in poverty. It's the perfect recipe for disaster and chaos.
This haunting tale is definitely a must-see! "
329," Perfect in every way!! WOW üëèüèºüëèüèº
"," Not a huge Phoenix fan, or Phillips fan.. but wow did they ever work hard on this! Phoenix stands alone and takes this film in as his baby. The acting / cinematography / violence / character development / setting.. all perfect!<br/><br/>We don't deserve this film<br/><br/>11/10 "
330," Not overhyped at all
"," I though I was going to be unimpressed with this movie honestly, 'cause I had really high expectations, but I wasn't, it really is a great movie.
Joaquin's performance was truly AMAZING, give the guy some awards people, he deserves it. "
331," A perfect comic character based film - JOKER_2019
",
332," An instant classic, with the best performance since Ledger's Joker. Also, it has the most impactful last 15 minutes of any movie ever.
"," I was on board for this movie since day one. When the first trailer came out I was shocked by how you could see the the care and detail in every shot of the movie. And, Phoenix's performance looked insane. After the final trailer I was sure this movie was going to become best movie of 2019. And, when I finally coud watch, all my expectations were fulfilled. From start to end this movie just cannot stop. You will laugh, you will get shocked, you will even cry. This is the best character study I have seen since Taxi Driver. Simply, magnificent. And that ending, well... "

334," Cinematic Masterpiece
"," Joker is one of a kind comic book movie. Packed with top notch cinematography and Phoenix's career best acting, this movie is the best to come out in years. "
335," Phenomenal!!!!!
"," Amazing story, writing and acting. A superb comic book and regular crime drama movie. It's the origin of Joker from Detective comics #1 in 1940 by Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson, the deep dive character study of Taxi Driver with story elements of Kings of Comedy.<br/><br/>10/10 "
336," Best film I've ever seen in a cinema
"," Hands down. Oscar worthy on many fronts. Phoenix really raised the bar on Joker with a stellar performance. Critics are out of touch, partisan, narrative pushers who couldn't review anything objectively if their life depended on it. Off to their beloved gulags with them and into the cinema you go. "
337," Never been so captivated by a movie before
"," This movie or Shawshank Redemption takes the number 1 spot of my favorite movies. Seen it in thereaters twice. Masterpiece, well done Joaquin Phoenix, supreme acting. He must get an Oscar for this!<br/><br/>I cannot wait for Joker 2.<br/><br/>10/10 "
338," A masterpiece like no other.
"," First of all I will say it from the get go, go see this movie. There isn't a single thing missing. The direction, the cinematography, the acting, the scores and the feelings that this movie portrays all blend together perfectly to create the masterstroke that this movie is. Many critics keep complaining that ""there isn't a clear point"" that the movie tries to make and it confuses me. The society's marginalization of people with mental illnesses and the unjust economical inequalities are for me the crystal-clear points that this movie made. Cinematography at it's purest form. This movie is a gem like no other. 10/10. "
339," Amazing tragedy
"," Dark, twisted and amazingly disturbing. Arthur is such a complex character. This movie isn't just abou t him as a character but an example of how a mentally ill person lives and wants to be normal. I have a mental illness as well and I relate to Arthur perfectly, people have let me down, I've felt like my life was worth nothing. And we mentally ill people we just want to be noticed and understood, and that's what Arthur really wanted in his life, I perfectly relate to him. This film also tells us how bullying can affect the victim and what a cruel world this is. Otherwise, the film felt heavy and tragic. I watched it 2 days ago and it's still bugging in my head. Could definitely watch it again. "
340," Possibly the best 2019 movie
"," Maybe it's not connected to the comics or it's source material, but for the love of god, THIS movie is everything i ever wanted for a movie about the infamous clown prince of crime.<br/><br/>Joaquin's performance is beautiful, scary, depressing, and violent. From Phoenix' laugh, you can actually feel his sorrow, to be honest i feel sad everytime he laughed.<br/><br/>Also a plus point for the cinematography and scoring, both score and visuals made a prefect blend.<br/><br/>This movie diffuses illusion, dreams, and reality into one, so it's kinda hard to tell which is which.<br/><br/>So it's a 10/10 from me. "
341," A masterful play between the lines of insanity and tragedy
"," This truly is Phoenix's magnum opus. Few films are able to have such strongly resonating and impactful displays of violence that over the span of the film, through such an emotionally developed character, creates an uneasy feeling of genuine consequence to each driving action that Arthur performs in the creation of his alter ego.<br/><br/>Phoenix's performance is so unnervingly raw the viewer is left perplexed by the deep insight into the constantly decaying mind of the man behind the makeup. A pleasantly surprising dedication to a role prior known only to fans of the character as a chaotic evil. "
342," Simply Brilliant
"," The whole movie, starting from the very first scene, connects to you deeply. It is a rare movie, I'd say, these kind of movies are made once in a century. It has all kinds of emotions, lows and highs, ups and downs, everything. The way they connect the story between Arthur Fleck (early Joker) &amp; kid Bruce Wayne (Batman in future) made so much sense and had so much meaning to it. The script, story, screenplay, direction, everything in the movie was on point. The Music Director - Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir completely nailed the BGM.<br/><br/>I don't think we can find any fault in the movie, because there was not even one single actor who acted a bit off. Everything in this movie, was simply, perfect.<br/><br/>Hence, Simply Brilliant. "
343," What a movie

344," Good Performance and Story!!
", I can tell Joaquin Phoenix doesn't looked like he is acting in the movie but he already dominates the role of the Joker himself and that is why he is an Oscar-Worthy. And actually the storyline is a little bit slow but it's very perfect.Great job!! 
345," Disturbingly Beautiful
"," This film lives up to the hype. It was superbly crafted and I can smell the Oscar nominations already. I will also say it was probably one of the most psychologically disturbing films I've ever seen and I'm not in any hurry to see it again any time soon.
But do yourself a favour, see it on the big screen, it'll add to the intensity. "

351," Movie was so good and twisted I had to review it
"," Joker really is a movie you should think about watching before you actually do see it. It's twisted, demented and true to art imitating life. I squirmed many times due to how close to reality it was. Never expected a movie about a villain to be excruciatingly beautiful. It definitely isn't for everyone and that's fine. Joaquin Phoenix did Joker justice to the point where I was happy to how he came to be. "

Go ahead and watch it, it really worth it,
I've already seen it twice in three days. "
366," Incredible and captivating
"," One of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. This movie has a lot of levels. The psychopath construction is uncomfortable and attractive. It brings an invitation to ask ourselves if the concept of ""good and bad"" makes sense. Because all of us have the potential to become monsters when we're not able to control nor understand our own demons. But only some can exploit their true nature by being precisely a monster. And that keeps me thinking about the bravery and its shadows. It's a movie that hangs onto you and assaults some proper ideas during a burst of laughter. Joaquin Phoenix does an unbelievable job, he's one of my favourite actors and his work impressed me deeply. Incredible art direction, the colours and photography are the perfect apology for Mr Todd Phillips's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Incredible and captivating. "
367," Great origin story
"," Wasnt sure if I'd be a fan of seeing the jokers origin story on the big screen specially as half the appeal to the joker is the mystery of his origin baring the red hood origin anyway. Thought it was a brilliant watch seeing his slow decent and learning how his tragic upbringing molded him. The ending when emerged as the finished product ""the joker"" honestly dont think an origin story could of been none better and the acting performance from Joaquin phoenix was top notch! "

Best movie i have seen in years!!! "
374," A MUST SEE MOVIE
"," I went in for the second time for this movie because of how blown away I was the first time and how bone-chilling the experience was, the second time was no different it only made me appreciate the movie even more. An absolute must see, one of the greatest movies ever made in the 21st century with one of the greatest acting performances of all time by Joaquin Phoenix since heath ledger in the dark knight!

377," Amazing. Captivating. Immersive. Raw.
"," I am typically a fan of what Marvel has done, and initially saw no point to this movie when it was announced and couldn't see Phoenix doing the role justice, particularly after Heath Ledger's brilliant take on the Joker.
How wrong was I? This movie starts slowly, and draws you into Arthur's world without you realising it until you can't look away from the screen for fear of missing a single second of it. It is raw, it is personal, it is disturbing, it is sad, and it is deeply resonant of some of the troubles we are experiencing today in the world. This is the Joker, arch-nemesis of Batman, yet you feel empathy for him, and can't completely disagree with his actions. He only hurts those who he perceives hurt him, even if his justice is fatal and doesn't befit the crime. ""Wrong me, and you are dead,"" is not justice, and each of his victims display their own weaknesses and frailties, and aren't inherently bad people.
This is a brilliant movie. One of the few I went back to the cinema to watch again. It deserves Oscar recognition for Phoenix, Todd Phillips, cinematography, and the score.
Congratulations all round! "
378," Cigarettes and Mayhem
"," A very dark movie with superb Acting and Cinematography. I felt all kinds of emotions all throughout the film. Laughter, Pity, Aggression, and finally validation for Arthur fleck towards the end. I can't wait for how they will develop a sequel to this story. "
379," send in the clowns
"," In the first 5 minutes, Arthur cried twice. that gasping, uncontrollable laughter was actually crying. he cried and nobody realized. people, stupid people asked ""what's so funny?"" when he was actually crying and beat him when they didn't like how he made them feel.
I dont know about other countries but I have never seen a cinema, in this time of day, in Egypt this crowded except for avengers endgame. more shocking is people laughed! laughed with the joker. I don't know what it says about mental health here but I have concerns.
we live in planet so bent on denying bad thoughts. someone brilliantly called it ""toxic positivity"". saying ""cheer up"", ""just be happy"", ""smile!"" and ""think happy thoughts"" is just so cruel. Arthur telling the stone faced social worker ""you don't listen, do you? you never listen. you just ask the same questions every week. are you having any bad thoughts? ALL I have is bad thoughts"".
the real wakeup call here is we know from the comics that Thomas Wayne was good guy, he was sincere in his wish to save Gotham and I'm assuming Murray was a good guy too bc I waited for big villain reveal but he seemed genuinely nice. if that's how nice people treat mental illness, HOW WE TREAT IT??? the answer is resonating yes.
Alfred explained to Bruce in batman the dark knight how some men just want to watch the world burn. well, monsters aren't born, they are created.
in the end, he danced in hallway after killing the therapist, he wasn't escaping, he didnt have plans. the joker is very simple man indeed. he wishes to watch the world burn and he is the villain we deserve. "
380," Way better than I expected
"," I loved the movie, great actor great acting
It was soooooo good
Sad and depressive
But cool "
381," Joker = A Masterpiece
"," If you haven't known already, this is an in-depth review of the 2019 movie Joker and it will contain a lot of spoilers. I strongly recommend you to check the movie out before reading this because it really is a masterpiece, and you should respect it by watching it in the theatres. I personally give this movie a full score as it really exceeded my expectations on all aspects of the movie. However, I understand that this movie is not for everyone. If you're more likely to watch action movies, then I don't think this movie will suit you. Here are a few criterias that I would like to talk about which made this movie an overall dark, disturbing and mesmerising masterpiece.<br/><br/>First of all, let's talk about the cinematography and the score of this movie. It undoubtedly uses a bluish constrast to create this sort of a cold and chaotic city feeling in the early 80s or 90s, much like the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"". In my opinion, this is brilliant as it sets the mood for the movie that we're about to experience and the surrounding condition for a story that revolves around a man (Arthur Fleck) and his drastic descend into insanity, caused by the broken society. As this movie symbolises Arthur's depression, it is important to let the audience know and feel what it's like to be him, and how he view the outside world. The score in this movie is extremely phenomenal. I don't think this movie will give out such a big impact on me if this score wasn't there. What really surprises me is that you can actually feel Arthur's depression through the score, like it's secretly giving out information to you. The score gave the sort of impression where Arthur is a sad, depressed and miserable person inside a clown's body. Finally, I also think that the score serves as a signal which makes the audience feel like they are the joker. For instance, the audience is so used to hearing this music when something bad happens to Arthur that they will attach this music to a bad occurrence. As a result, supposedly a mentally-ill person is very unpredictable in some ways will be predictable now as the audience recognise the score even when something positive is happening. They kind of know when Arthur will finally snap.<br/><br/>Secondly, let's dive into the story itself. As a summary, Arthur fleck is an innocent guy, working as a clown and a standup comedian who is driven crazy by the society. This character is portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix who, in my opinion, is one of the best actors working today. One aspect of the film which I thought is extremely brilliant, is Arthur's laugh. In previous Batman movies, the character Joker laughs all the time because they are psychotic and laughing pleases them in certain ways normal human cannot comprehend. This Joker, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. Arthur has a condition which causes him to laugh uncontrollably due to nerve problems in his brain. This, I have to salute to Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix for taking the risk to approach this Joker character in a different way, much different from any Joker films ever made. Every laugh, you can feel Arthur's pain and loneliness. This is very important to create and emotional attach for the audience to Arthur. I personally think that Phoenix can win an Oscar just from that laugh sequences alone. During the first act, we follow Arthur through his daily routines. He works, then he comes home to his mother. every day. This tells the audience that Arthur is still a normal human being and not some psychopath from the very beginning. Then, things get rough and he loses his job for dropping a gun at a children's hospital. There's the subway scene where he was physically attacked by a few Wall Street guys. Due to the immense pressure, he killed all three of them using a gun which was given to him by a colleague of his. Although we are suppose to feel terrified by all this, we feel a sense of victory and satisfaction because that is how Arthur feels after killing them. This is also the scene where the gap between Arthur and the Joker narrows down. There is also this scene where Arthur realised that he was imagining his relationship with a neighbour of his, which was revealed later on in the movie. Although some people think that the reveal of this scene should be at the very end of the movie, I still think that it is perfect where it is. By putting this scene hanging in the middle of the movie, it will cause the audience to not be able to distinguish what's real and what's not. They might be thinking, the past isn't real. But, there are still a few more acts in the movie. Are those still real? I also like the fact that the Murray Franklin Show is very realistic. For example, laughters can be heard when Murray says something that is funny, much like a real talk show. As a result, when Arthur kills Murray at the very end during the talk show, it creates a very disturbing but realistic portrayal of an interview gone wrong. The audience no longer sites Arthur because they are deceived by Arthur's choice and they no longer recognise the man they once sympathised for. The last act is simply extraordinary and I cannot put into words how amazing it is. This is the part I simply don't want to spoil because it is your own choice how the story unfolds. There are no correct or wrong answers to what really happened to Arthur at the end because the audience is the Joker in this sense.<br/><br/>Lastly, i wrote this review in hopes that people take this movie seriously. This is not a superhero flick or any other sort of a trilogy. It's a stand-alone film and a character study of Joker. I sincerely hope that this kind of movies, although violent must be exposed to teenagers that are not the age of 18 as well. It's a very mature film and it can get teenagers nowadays to realise and be prepared for what's ahead of them. Do not fall into the wrong hands. Be wise and know how to manage your stress. If not, you're going to be like Arthur. That's what the movie is trying to say.<br/><br/>That's all. I hope you find this review helpful. "

Tod Phillips made it like every joker fan wanted, if Joaquin doesn't get Oscar then we must check the last oscar winings! "
385," Juaquin is impressive, Joker is not
"," How is this Joker suppost to stand a chance against Batman? I thought what made joker such a great villain was his intelligence, his manipulative ability and his ability to see the inner fears of his rivals. How far will he get by only being crazy and unpredictable? Juaquin could problably get pretty far (all the way to the Oscars stage), while Joker can't even enter through a door. "

389," How DC movies should be
"," Forget about the critics! They always bash DC for being too 'dark' and, in this case, for promoting violence and mental illness.<br/><br/>Enough with the lame joke-infested Marvel type of movies targeted towards kids. The world needs to appreciate the more serious movies that tend to focus on crucial cinematic elements (in particular, plot and character development).<br/><br/>This film is no where close to boring as it really shows you the Joker's transition whilst emitting a disturbing vibe that will leave you cringing simply from Joaqin's phenomenal acting. "
390," Brilliant
"," The movie is very good. A unique story, and Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb and definitely on par with Heath ledgers performance in the dark knight (2008). While the movie is slow in parts, you are always on the edge of your seat. Amazing film. Would love to see Joaquin as the Joker again! Nothing but a 10/10 "
391," Masterpiece especially in IMAX - The audience applauded!
"," Best Joker adaption ever, everything dark you'd want from such a character and I smiled throughout! Well worth every penny. Perfect amount of madness and incredible soundtrack. I don't even have complaints I am very satisfied - I absolutely love the profoundness in it. Joaquin Phoenix and Health Ledger are the best Jokers we'll have. I really hope this get nominated for the Oscars I'd dance a wild jig! Also this is my 550th review which is really cool! "
392," TRULY A MASTERPIECE
"," All the props to the team that made this fantastic movie. I have no words to express how i'm feeling about this movie, it was shocking, terifying and beautiful at the same time. I had high expectations about this movie and it delivered! The only movie i was not mad that i paid to see it in theatre. I don't know who are those people that the news say they walked out of the theatre because Joker was bad, or too violet, but they have no idea what they are talking about. This movie is perfect, from every scene, the cinematografy, the acting, the lighting, and omg, the MUSIC. 10/10 Best movie i've seen in the last 10 years. Give it a chance, don't let negative reviews fool you, you should watch it and decide for yourself it it's good or no. "
393," An exceptional study of human unhappiness and turn out!
"," A thought-provoking, disturbing 2 hours long journy will haunt you for a long time. Thanks to tod phillips with an diffrent style of telling a story with an impeccable performance by Joaquin Phoenix, it is an unbelievable cinema experinece with creating a new genra of cinema as art! "
394," Dark but Entrancing
"," I'll first start by saying this movie is very dark. It's the type of movie that makes you uncomfortable at some point in every scene. That being said, it's exactly the way this character should be portrayed. Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix as he takes you through the journey for Jokers evolution. This isn't a movie full of action packed fighting or battle scenes. Instead, it's a real life example that mirrors our world today. Amazing performances. Amazing film. "
395," It's just so dark and so awesome
", I was just stunned after watching the movie . A sure nomination for the Oscars !!! 
396," Thank you
"," Just saw the movie in a midnight premiere in our local and favorite movie theater, and all I can say is thank you! Thank you Mr. Phoenix for a truly awesome, lovable and emotional performance, thank you Mr. Phillips for your creativity and writing. When it comes to Batman and all of Gothams citizens in the movies I'm always pretty sceptic wether they'll be played and portrait right, but when Mr. Phoenix was announced as the next Joker I knew there was no need to worry, then came the first teasers and trailers and my hope grew bigger, and now all I can say is thank you!! "
397," Great !
", DC finally gives us a good movie after keeping us waiting for a long time. 
398," This is absolutely amazing
", Phoenix is a best joker ever he deserved oscar<br/><br/>This is a best movie of this year 
399," A classy character study on rise of the Clown Prince, Joaquin Phoenix & Todd Philips both deserve to be applauded
"," Aw it yesterday in India (it released here on 2nd October).. My opinion: Brilliant film helmed by Todd Philips with an Oscar worthy turn by Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. This movie is more ""class"" than ""mass"". This is a very unique take on the character, very different from the Dark Knight's Joker that was played so awesomely by The late Heath Ledger. The film stays with you long after the end credits roll. I would like to add that it would be unfair &amp; unnecessary to compare Joaquin's Joker with Ledger's Joker, since the same character is written differently in both films, and both these brilliant actors succeed in leaving their own unique impression on the viewer. And yes, the violence in this film has been totally overhyped some of the media outlets, the film is more a character study/drama with only a few scenes of violence that have been placed in sync with the story. Those expecting an ""action"" film, are likely to be disappointed.
Though this movie was planned as a standalone, I hope the success of this film inspires a Sequel.
My rating: 10/10 "
400," Dissappointing and Underwhelming
",
401," Movie of the year
"," This movie shows the true origin of the joker that has never seen before in cinema. I went in expecting non-stop action. But I was wrong, it is more subtle and takes important aspects from the source material. JP's acting is incredible and the trans-formation from Arthur to the Joker is portrayed remarkably well. The laugh he makes added with a great selection of sound and style of the movie makes it that much creepier. You sort of feel sympathy for Arthur and what he's been through even though, he is committing terrible acts of violence. There is elements of dark comedy which blends well with his character. The plot is strong and the director has done a very good job. This stand-alone movie pays great tribute to previous installents and will be go down as one of the best DC movies ever made. "
402," WoW!!!!

"," Casting was really good. No crazy surprise breakaway performances - everybody fit their parts and held their own (which is hard in the face of Phoenix and DeNiro).<br/><br/>But the way the story unfolds, the foreshadowing, the grand revelations - absolutely masterful! Nobody would ever expect such good writing to be invested in a comic book villain origin story, but alas... "
405," Beautiful. Haunting. Hard-hitting.
"," JOKER review:
A brilliant movie. Outstanding Phoenix. Genius Todd Phillips. BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING. "
406," Good Film but nothing to do with the Joker
"," The performance of Joaquin is excellent but the story simply don't have anything to do with the Joker, it's more about a mentaly ill man struggling with his chaotic enviroment until it's overwhelmed and snaps. I would be a much better film if the title was ""Arthur"" or ""The Clown"" but the fact that it's forced to be related to the batman universe it's why i feld it didn't work. "
407," The stuff
"," This was easily the best movie I have seen in so long. It is pure art from the beginning to the end. From the camerawork, to the plot, to the acting, this movie is far better than any of the junk on the market right now. It's worth Every single penny trust me. So good. So good. Sweet Caroline so good. Enjoy this once in a. Lifetime experience boys and girl/z. You won't regret it mwah "
408," A masterpiece
"," This movie felt...different. it felt truly as if I were watching a movie that was very unique. Loved every bit of this movie. The cinematography, score, dialogue and etc was great. Joaquin was excellent. If he doesn't win an oscar, the academy is a joke. He deserves it for sure. This movie shows a great way of how someone mentally unstable was affected by the world that he was surrounded by. This movie in no way tried to justify what he did. The only scene you could say that maybe tried to justify him was the ending from how everyone was cheering him on, but they weren't good people clearly as they were burning down the city and causing travesty. Anyways, great movie, a must see for sure! "

412," Amazing movie, has so many reflections.
", I don't see why people find this movie dark and cynical. I honestly don't find it the most depressing movie to watch particularly because it is reflective of many aspects of our lives that are far worse. The movie is all about Joaquin Phoenix and how brilliant he acts. Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen. 
413," Possibly the most underrated film ever.
"," While I usually find the argument ""Don't listen to the critics"" childish, I will make an exception for this movie. It's FAR from the violence inciting slop the media is painting it as. Joker is a near masterpiece that, while definitely borrowing elements from other films like Taxi Driver, stands on its own as a fantastic film. Joaquin Pheonix does an incredible job and delivers one of his greatest performances as Arthur Fleck/The Joker. Pheonix really makes you feel sympathy for Arthur even if the things that he does are morally wrong and not defendable in the slightest. If you wanted a comic-book film that was more grounded in realism and 100x grittier than The Dark Knight trilogy, then this might be the movie you've always dreamed of. But the brutal violence and disturbing nature of the film is so masterfully done that it can't be dismissed as ""disgusting"" or bad because the movie is simply doing it's job well. It didn't exactly get me emotional, but it was very hard-hitting at times and some scenes had me on the edge of my seat. I think if it was a tad more original in some areas then it would be a damn near masterpiece, but overall, Joker is an amazing film that should definitely be seen at least once. "
414," The film shines a mirror on society, and society does not like what it sees.
",
415," Perfect Movie!
"," Everyone should watch this one, because in my perspective of view is the best movie in the last 5 years. Joaquin Phoenix did his best perfomance and created his own incredible Joker. In addition, you can find many aspects that involves our social life, and this aspect is very important for us, because we have the chance to see and in the sequence, discuss about the subject and how deep is this masterpiece. "
416," wow...just...wow
"," I've never been a Joaquin Phoenix fan, Til today that is. Finally, for once, the reviews on IMDB were truthful. There's a reason its rated an overall 9 on here. Not sure how anyone can rate it less than 10, but whatever, i'll take it.
His performance in this film as Joker is nothing less than Oscar-worthy. I never thought I would actually be #teamjoker but I am. I'm not a comic reader so of course I never judge a movie based off of that. It was beautifully directed, and pointed a grim picture of what led up to Joker becoming Joker. Twists and turns in every direction. People complained that it took awhile to get going. NOT TRUE. I'm not going to go into a full synopsis of the film because you can read that on the main page. I'm just giving my thoughts. Best film of the year...if not the last 5 years that I have had the pleasure of watching. Movies have been trash lately, so its nice to finally see a gem like this. I'll say it again... OSCAR "
417," In On The 'Joker'
",
418," Give him an Oscar
", Joaquin Phoenix exceeded with this performance. Never felt so uncomfortable watching someone perform. Yes I felt bad for him but there was a darkness in his eyes that stopped me from doing that too often. 
419," Comic book story telling for adults and intellectuals
"," Great performances from all involved. Phillips is awesome with telling the story he wanted and leaving room for interpretation. Expressing his own feelings of society. Conveying it through the tragic story of a person having been beaten by society, now choosing the wrong path. Letting go and giving into his own sick and twisted perspective of the world that treated him so brutally. Returning the hate and anger bestowed upon him. It's sad and wonderful, mischievous and marvelous all at the same time. As an avid comic book, movie , joker, nerd. I felt Joaquin captured his darkness that grew from innocence to violence. His quirks and ticks are exactly what I imagined a live Joker to be, without being cheesy. you see him immerse himself into the madness that lives with the Joker and becomes apart of you as you follow the rabbit hole of the joker. Great stuff, fascinating approach. "
420," Don't see it as a DC film.
"," Focus on Arthur. This film is on point with what they want told. I've seen movies that deals with the same idea, but this is just a lecture.<br/><br/>A very human society revolves around Arthur and sends him down a path full of conflicts and challenges. To understand why this representation of society can be considered normal, you have to see that this is what our contemporary generation has led to. Everything in this film is normal, normal because it happens and happened. We try to prevent it but its so normalized that it still happens. The problem isn't because of having either mental issues or normal issues, its the fact that we consider them two different things, and forget that the simple concept was to comfort the ones who are going through tough times, and just be there for them.<br/><br/>We have opened a network of wrongs and it will keep on breeding more wrongs, until we choose to stop and do something about it.

421," Joker Gets In Your Head & Never Leaves
"," Joker's like getting in a time machine and going back to 1983 and watching a movie that was made without modern restraints to be thought provoking &amp; entertaining, definitely NOT made to be PC, LGBT or appeal specifically to the Chinese or any minority. Joker was made for all mankind. The bought and paid for mainstream media critics will hate Joker, but true film fans will leave having seen something unapologetically original and unimaginably enjoyable. Joker resembles Taxi Driver or Platoon for getting in your head with brutal honesty and never leaving. "
422," On So Many Levels, In So Many Ways JOKER Is Cinema PERFECTION!
"," I have to fan geek out on this FILM! It is simply one of the most perfect efforts in cinema ever. If JOKER does not rake in awards or more specifically multiple Oscars I will be befuddled! Joaquin Phoenix always delivers a masterful performance in all of his movies however this performance is truly magnificent. I was spellbound by him and by so much more. This music is phenomenal and high praises to Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir!!!!! I will be seeking this brilliant composer to listen more of. Lawrence Shers' cinematography was beautiful and the film color/saturation was so spot on!!! KUDOS! Editing? Beautifully done!!!! Thanks to Jeff Groth and his team if he has one! I could keep singing about this movie but I will spare everyone....but damn, the man who brought it all together, director Todd Phillips. Masterful job!!!!! I wanted to stand up and cheer during the credits.... :) LOVED IT! "

425," most important message of tis time - better then Ledger?
"," This movie is astonishing,
This movie managed to tie all loose ends. The outstanding acting makes the movie so much more believable and realistic, and every character is designed perfectly and have major role in the plot.
The camera shots in this film are perfect, mostly wide blurred shots slowly creeping in making it so much more disturbing.
Plot - This movie is so disturbing and gritty just as it should be, it shows what really can happen in life when a person with mental health issues or even a healthy person that has hit rock bottom and has no one to help them 'back' up.<br/><br/><ul><li>The message is perfect for the times we live in, in 2019, the rich and healthy should not be separated from the sick and poor; from the mentally challenged. We should live in a society where anyone can be helped and anyone can be heard no matter what level they stand at, before they spiral.</li></ul> "
426," Must See of 2019!
"," Joaquin Phoenix was amazing. I wanted to give him a standing ovation at the end of the film. If he doesn't get all the awards for best actor next year, people will probably riot on the streets with clown masks on.<br/><br/>I have to say, the setting, cinematography, music, the acting were all so brilliant. Although I understood why some of the critics gave a bad review, especially on how the film makers drew inspiration for Martin Scorsese's past films, this movie was exceptional in its own way.<br/><br/>The only thing I thought of after finishing the film was how the plot was a bit basic. However, everything else was just too good!!<br/><br/>Must see of 2019! Also I hope there won't be a sequel, let this beauty become a legendary standalone film, PLEASE! "
427," This movie is truly a masterpiece.
"," I have never in my life felt a movie like I did the joker. This movie is truly a masterpiece and it made me feel something I have never felt before. I cant stop thinking about the movie after I watched it yesterday I am just completely blown away. The music, the actor, the story.. Truly something else. My expectations were so high for this movie and the movie was far better then I ever imagined. Jesus Christ if you haven't seen this movie you are in for a treat. Im gonna go watch it again bye. "

Some people claiming the movie was odd, too dark and pacing but, in my opinion The odd and pacing on this movie was necessary for the public to understand what is mental illness. Photography, sound track and direction is delightful. Definily a must own movie, watched for second time already and I will many more.

"," I am not a fan of the dd batman universe, I am never interested, but they recommended the movie and I do not regret those 122 minutes I spent watching this magnificent piece of art. The direction, photography and lighting is brutal and accompanies the progress and development of the plot and the character. Phoenix played the joker spectacularly and magnificently, I loved his performance and I found the best selection. The development of the joker and his thankfulness is incredible, his important moments were well managed and he loved everything about him. Frances conroy great as always. If you did not see it, watch it, even if you are not a fan or have not seen other movies, just watch it, because it is not essential. One of the best movies of the year "

"," When you're at the beginning of the movie, you think that you've got it all figured out: Arthur's mental illness, Sophie and even his mom, but when you progress through it you start seeing things the other way; you start doubting everything and every theory you had about his life and his motives, was everything you saw really happening or was it just a product of Joker's crazy imagination, was he even there or was he in the Arkham Asylum imagining it all. That's the beauty of this movie - it makes you wonder. That's why I think that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar and that's why I rated it 10 out of 10. I could go on and on about how perfect and fitting was the music and choreography but let's just leave it at that. If you didn't already, go watch it and have your mind blown! "
439," Best Since the Dark Knight
"," One of the best films since the Dark Knight trilogy came out. So incredibly profound that I left the theater appreciating it more and more as I couldn't stop thinking about all the subtleties in the script and acting that made it perfect. I've never seen another movie like it. Going to see it again soon and will buy the blu-Ray when it's released. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Do not listen to the critics and do not think ""it's just hype"" go see it for your self and see how incredible this masterpiece truly is. "
440," Cinematic Masterpiece
"," Even days after watching this I literally cannot get Joker out of my head. It's one of the best films I have seen in years. It's dark, menacing, chaotic &amp; yet beautiful.

I laugh at the controversies surrounding this by people with no clue as to what mental illness is or lack the capacity to know the spectrum it covers. See this movie. You will walk away having been impacted by one thing or the other. 
449," PURE ART!
"," The story is immerse and is filled with emotions. Joaquin Pheonix completely sweeps you into joker's sufferings, rage, grief with his incredible performance. The movie forces you to think about living life from emotionally troubled person's perspective. It's a must watch movie. And the ending is one of the greats. "

"," In my opinion this movie should be the example for future films, because it proved that good movies can be created without cgi. This movie contains a profound character, and plot. Furthermore, Joaquin Phoenix's play is exceptional, and his devotion for this role can not be ignored. I can recommend it to those, who want to know the origin of Joker. "
452," Joaquin Phoenix does the role of his life.
"," It's a masterpiece. Simple as that. Joaquin does the role of his life in this movie. It felt so real, Arthur really is a troubled man and boy did we get the perfect man to play him. The writing and directing is also amazing, Todd Phillips really makes you feel the Scorsese-Taxi Driver vibes. It's so dark and it makes you sympathize with Arthur when you really shouldn't in a way.<br/><br/>I am going to watch it again, for sure. Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. This will be a classic. "

459," Beautiful cinematography, slow and steady build up with intense character development
"," Such a different kind of film it's hard to describe, but I'll try. Dark, twisted, humanly relatable, psychotic realism from the point of view of an impoverished society letting its citizens fall through the gaps. It's the perfect combination of uncomfortable, awkward, sad, and funny. I'm pretty sure I felt new untapped emotions without current names, like discovering a new species of animal. It's a work or art, not a super hero of anti-hero movie. Many will be disappointing, as a little of me was, but most of me was very very satisfied. Don't walk there with any expectations, just an open pallet and soak up the paint as it's brushed. "
460," Way too many 10s. This was a technical masterpiece and Phoenix was great.
",
461," A perfect film that is so entertaining, so emotionally and psychologically touching and so thought provoking!
"," I couldn't care any less about comics and I went into this blind without knowing about any of the hype expecting a ""meh"" movie. This is now my favourite movie of all time. It is one of those movies that makes you want to run back home to search for any scenes that might be available on the net and re-watch them again and again. Every scene is so powerful, gripping and fresh. The music, acting, dancing and cinematography is mesmerising. ""Joker"" is a masterpiece. "
462," Will Hopefully Be Talked About for a Long Time
",
463," No wonder critics are afraid of it.
"," See. Its been such a long time since there has been a movie which is not supposed to make you feel happy or just give you moments. I am so happy that I got to witness this and see it. It will hit your soul. It will make you ask questions. It will make you think so hard, which is something we don't get in movies anymore.
Also, even though this is called ""Joker"", I hope people don't forget about Arthur, because I think that's what's important. The journey of Arthur to whatever he becomes.
I am glad I am alive in 2019 to witness this masterpiece. "
464," The Academy owes Phoenix an Oscar for this role
"," Everyone is talking about how violent and disturbing this film is... well, what's violent and disturbing is the REAL WORLD out there!!! American politics must change!! That's the message!! That's the films critic to society!! Mental health needs to be addressed!! Guns must be regulated!!<br/><br/>Congratulations to the team who make this masterpiece possible and without any doubt the best performance of Joaqu√≠n Phoenix in any roll and the best Joker characterization of all time. "
465," Not ledger but wow
"," One of the best movies this year and pay attention, this is not a super hero movie. Joaquin performance is outstanding but it's not as good as heath's one.
It's one of those movies that it's totally worth it to go see it on a cinema. The intense songs when gooes louder it makes a good and dark feeling into it. A fantastic movie, and an incredible performance by Joaquin. "
466," A Great Movie
"," Phoenix really did this role with a new style. It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY! I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it. The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message! Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great. "
467," Mesmerizing and Disturbing at the same time!
"," If I have to speak about acting after you have scrolled down the star cast section, I would do a disservice to the actors and the director.<br/><br/>So, we would talk about the outstanding story, wonderful script writing, surprising cinematography and marvelous character development- things that we do not talk about that often.<br/><br/>
This movie shows how you can make a Shawshank Redemption kind of film from a comic book character.<br/><br/>Make Todd Phillips the creative head of DCEU and you will have more such masterpieces. "
468," For Joaquin Phoenix
"," This movie is nothing but showcase of Joaquin Phoenix acting skills. He took whole movie on his shoulders.
And That laugh. You will get goosebumps, everytime he laughs. "
469," Masterpiece give us Joker 2

Just incredible. "
471," One of the best films I have ever seen...
"," I had heard bad reviews from critics on this film but after deciding to go see the film, I do not regret seeing it one bit. The story telling of this film is something the film industry is lacking these days. "
472," The only top 10 iMd movie... with non green critics score
"," I will never listen or read to critics. For the first time in my life, I didnt want a movie to end. Time was not enough, I wanted to see more of the Joker. "
473," Phoenix Gives His All
"," A true tragedy that shocks at every turn. Watching a broken man fall further into brokenness and eventually madness. Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance that brings the Joker character to life in a visceral and gut punching way. Along with a horrifying score and beautiful cinematography, Joker is one of this years must watches. "
474," In line with Heith Ledger
",
475," Joker is a representation of modern societies troubles
"," The masterpiece behind Joker is multifaceted, which is exactly why it is a masterpiece. It has flawless acting, perfect directing and real, gritty revelations of real life. If anyone thinks this movie is bad because it suggests we should feel empathy towards Arthur despite his evil actions, they are part of the system which caused this trouble in the first place. Mental health does not exist in a vacuum; it is interrelated with a society and a system which does not care for people with disadvantage. Crimes rates soar and the community demands protection and justice; justice is served by detention and alienation. The cycle repeats itself until society is tricked to believing that there is a singular person to blame, but the imperfections of the system and lack of support from society is creating more Jokers than one movie discussing its subject matter. For this reason, Joker is bold, novel and technically perfect, it is a movie for the Ages, akin to that of There Will be Blood and Taxi Driver. It is a character study like no other! "
476," Shockingly bad... in a good way. A very good way!
"," This movie is as dark and morbid as they come. Don't expect this film to have anything to do with Batman or even the joker. They could've just made a film about a random person that struggles with mental health issues and it would've been a winner. Yes, it's a film about how the Joker came to be but for me, it was more than that. There's a much darker yet relatable story that it tells. It's almost a documentary about the very real illness that MANY of us face but are too scared to reveal until breaking point. The addition of the Joker, well, that's just a bonus. It's not often that a film can make you sympathise with the villain especially after some of the gruesome acts he does, yet, somehow by the end, you can't help but be on his side which actually makes you feel a little uncomfortable after the movies over. Brilliant film, incredible acting and certainly plays on your mind for a while after. "
477," Make Batman good again
"," Why can't the producers of Batman movies make it as good as this movie? Like it was on Dark Knight. DC should learn from the success of this move. Stop tryin to be like Marvel, have your own style, dark, gloomy and thrilling. "
478," Joker begins
",
479," Amazing
", Really good plot and GREAT acting just extremely dark 
480," This is how DC movies should be made
"," This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time. "
481," Epic !!!
"," Oscar for Joaquin !! Such an epic movie, Joaquin is truly Joker "
482," Masterpice
"," Everything about this movie is perfect,if Joaquin Phoenix won t win the oscar I will stop watching movies. "
483," The hype is real.. Best acting material in at least 10 years
"," Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and in Joker you get to see his real acting material, he's amazing he's great he doesn't hesitate to give it his best and more. Joker movie is the best 2019 movie so far and probably in most recent years, from directing to the writing to the acting to the score, we were mesmerized the whole time, i give it 100 over 10, an American classic that will be talked about for many years.

"," This movie has to be one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar, without a doubt. The amount of work that he put into this film paid off. Such a dark and creepy movie. Will definitely be going back to theaters to rewatch. Loved it! "
486," The Damn Trailers...
"," Holy hell this turned out to be a good movie. Really enjoyed it in the theaters. One of the few comic movies where you actually start feeling something for the main character. The empathy is born from the good writing and the phenomenal performance of Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>The only thing mildly bad stuff about the movie -which isnt an issue about the movie- are the trailers. Dc did it again with the ""lets expose almost every scene in the movie with trailers"" mindset. Dont get me wrong the first teaser with the ""Smile"" piece was really cool and got me hyped for the movie. But it felt like I kinda knew what was gonna happen already. I dont mean the whole scenes itself but where Arthur is gonna in the next scene and stuff.<br/><br/>Even if the trailer kinda ruined my first watch I whole heartedly recommend this movie to everyone. "
487," The best in the world
", Best story in the year .. The joker will win the best film in the year .. 
488," Great drama, with a stand-out performance from Joaquin Phoenix
",
489," Good bit not great
"," Just came home from the cinema. My five cents: It's basically taxi driver 2 with a Joaquin phoenix overplaying pretty much every scene. I thought it was entertaining and beautifully shot, but not my favourite movie of the year. And come on, that ending with him at the show admitting killing those three guys without anyone doing anything. That was a bit too much. "
490," It was Awesome worth the hype
"," The acting,the story,the music, and the cinematography it was all awesome it was perfect looking forward to seeing this movie again with friends and familyü§°ü§°ü§° "
491," The best film of the year and possibly the best of the 21st century
"," What to say about this film that does not reflect the title, is the best we have been able to enjoy lately, everything is wonderful, the exquisite photography, the right atmosphere, the amazing and unsurpassed script, all seasoned in addition with a sublime direction of Todd Phillips, which shows that we must follow him very closely in future projects.
And I leave a point exclusively for Joaquin Phoenix, the guaranteed winner of the next Oscar, in my opinion it is one of the best male performances in the history of the seventh art, I do not think there are concrete words to do justice to his interpretation, therefore I will not say anything else.
Everyone should watch this movie. 10/10 "
492," why hate it?
"," This movie defines the reality of pur society we r living in
Now a days people just enjoy movies like avengers based on action and fight but dont like movies which based on their lives and the society they r living in "
493," Unreal Performance...
", If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an Oscar for this it will only be because Hollywood is too sensitive. Probably best portrayal of the Joker yet...even though I still love Heath Ledger's version. This is just on another level! Would only warn against seeing this if you can't handle disturbing images/violence/dialogue. I have seen some of the worst cinema has to offer and I still got nervous sweats and felt incredibly uncomfortable the whole way through. Good luck! 
494," Heath ledger would be proud
"," Joaquin Phoenix literally changed the game with acting as the joker. Left the cinema in amazement. I was virtually nearly off my seat for majority of the movie, and the movie definitely relates to what is going on in the world right now. "
495," Joker is not a movie. Its a phenomenon and a rare phenomenon.
"," Went to watch the movie as a Heath ledger fan, came out as Joaquin Phoenix biggest fan. Best perfomance I've seen for any character. The movie is a bit slow at times but thats how character building is done. The movie absorbs you in itself with each upcoming scene.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended. "
496," Stunning, disturbing and one hell of a good film!
"," First let me start by saying that this is the least ""comic""-book movie made. There aren't any big and bombastic fight scenes, no set-up for sequals. This is a piece about a man who has been abused his entire life and finally decides to snap and do something about it. I know it is easy to get lost in todays world and the way that people treat this movie is unfair. It's not a political piece, it's not a movie about the ""good sides of violence"" (as some people have called it). It is a movie about a man struggling to find love, job and joy in his life. And Arthur's transformation in the famous Joker is beautifully done. When the movie starts you can see how uncomfortable and awkward Arthus is but by the end (the last 20 minutes when he is actually the Joker) you see everythyng has changed. His movement, the way he talks, his actions and you just see how in control he is.
They way the violence is done in this movie has something personal to it. There are comments about how violent and gory it is. Complete lies, movies like Logan and Deadpool are way move brutal than Joker.
And now of course the star of the movie JOAQUIN PHOENIX. Oh man was he amazing. From his first line to his last you can see feel everything he feels (anger/passion/fear). And the way he handles the role is perfecr, other actors would have chosen to go big and scream a lot and use ""scary"" voices. But not him, he is tame and you can tell he has done his homework.
Overall I did not have any major problems with The Joker. I think it is beautiful, frightening, intense and it fully immersed me in the rotting world of Gotham.
10/10
Words can't do it justice so just go and see it with your own eyes. "

503," Ignore the critics, this is the movie of the decade!
",
504," Phoenix has outperformed Ledger... sorry ;)
"," Joker is a beautifully crafted character study following a man called Arthur as he descends into madness following the events of what he describes as, ""a bad day"".<br/><br/>Phillips has managed to create an entirely original and incredibly thought-provoking origin story that keeps some of the Joker's best comic book moments at its core, whilst also altering certain things that have very rarely been changed in the past such as turning Thomas Wayne into a rich snob that looks down on the working class rather than portraying him as a prestigious Doctor, as well as changing not only the Joker's colour scheme but also his face as well. I fell in love with this new rendition of the Joker and I couldn't think of any appearance that would better suit the title of 'The Clown Prince of Crime'. I'd even go as far to say that the Joker's look in this film is probably my favourite Joker look of all time.<br/><br/>Initially, the thought of giving the Joker an origin story seemed strange to me, however upon watching the movie I realise that Phillips has been able to make this origin story as vague as possible; was the story itself a literal depiction of what we saw on the screen or was it another story that Arthur made up and told his psychiatrist whilst being locked up in Arkham State Hospital. It could be either, but in my mind, as much as I love the events of the film, I believe that the story of Arthur Fleck becoming Joker is just another story that Joker uses when he is asked about his past. This would then follow the idea explored in 'The Killing Joke' about Joker preferring his past to be, 'multiple choice'. Also, some events of the film are revealed to be delusions taking place in Arthur's mind, such as his relationship with Sophie, and his first appearance on the Murray Franklin Show, so what's not to say that the film itself is just one big delusion.<br/><br/>Hopefully a sequel is on the cards, however I can also understand why they would want this film to be a solo flick. It's very rare that you would find a film as artsy and as well created as this to have a sequel. That being said, I do hope that Joaquin Phoenix returns to this role as I would love to see what he can achieve portraying the Joker for the length of a full film rather than just in the the third act. "
505," Overrated and overhyped
"," Story was just really unconvincing. Nobody really cares that much about some random dude who is as ineloquent and uninspired as the joker is. The hype portraying the movie as painful and cruel is just cringe. To see this rated better than ""One flew over cuckoos nest"" that shows way better cruelty saddens me. "
506," Just OK
"," Watched the movie, it was a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but it was a performance of a man going insane. The story being about Joker is an offshoot. The Thomas Wayne character is overdone and cocky. DO NOT see this movie as a DC comic version of the Joker it is not. "
507," greater than the teaser..!!

509," Believe the hype!
"," Do not let the matacritic score fool you ! It is comprised of people who are quick to label the film edgy jusy because it touches on social matters, people who in my opinion should not be able to publish a movie rating as professionals. Everything that has to do with The Joker is done in a perfect way. Not only is phoenix's performance astonishing but the cinematography and climate of the film are perfect. It is truly a drama that makes an excellent background story for the character and has you on your heels everytime Joaquin is on the screen. Plus the violence felt very impactful and carried a message instead of simply being a way to make the film more intense. "

511," Believe the hype
", I almost didn't go to see this as I've always had a problem viewing movies that have so hyped. But to be honest this is one movie worth seeing. I have been a total fan of Heath Ledgers Joker since it came out but to be fair this is worthy of being right up there with it. Phoenix's Joker is mesmerising and I found it hard to look away no matter how difficult the situation. I felt a lot of things during this performance and didn't need the whole box and dice of CGI trickery to get me there! Just stunning performances by all concerned. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone

"," Every year I deal with one issue - less new movies that deserve to be called art. But Joker is a rare example of what you can call art in every way.

"," I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role. "

"," We watched Joker tonight, and I expected good acting from Joaquin Phoenix, wasn't sure about the story and everything else but I was willing to see how it will go. What I didn't expect was that I wouldn't blink an eye throughout the movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just give us good performance, but made Joker so real. Like he is one of us, and as my friend said - scary part was that you could relate to him and be on the same track with his thoughts. Everything is perfect in this movie - story, acting, photography, music... hell even the colors of this world are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix carried the whole storry on his back - it was an one man show that took all your attention, imagination, stirred all your feelings and emotions and left you speechless when The End letters came on the screen. The best movie this year for sure - Phoenix deserves Oscar for this one and any other reward he can get in this world. BRILLIANT!!!! "

"," I am just amazed at how this only 69% of critics liked it, but it has a 9.0 here! I admit that it's not as good as Heath Ledger's Joker, but it's still awesome. The funny thing is that there's a good reason why the movie isn't called ""THE Joker"". The creators said that the Joker might just be a persona various people took. Batman does in fact appear in this, but only as a small child. He's worked very well into the plot.<br/><br/>I could really associate with what Joker was going through. He had been taking all these medicines yet none of them worked. He was angry at the rich for oppressing the poor. Him killing rich people at first really does inspire people. It really was a great study on the status of the richest and treats the story as very mundane. That was kind of already done in ""The Dark Knight"", but the focus is done so well here too. ***1/2 "

"," I haven't seen such a masterpiece for a long time. It's unbelievable. I don't know if it was right to still call this acting, as it seems to have been brought from another dimension.

", What can I say? I'm a massive Batman fan and a little obsessed with the franchise. I wanted to watch this movie to get a background on the Joker to complete my Batman experience. I've watched every Batman ever made including the Adam West TV show as a kid.<br/><br/>I came out of this movie in absolute awe and to be honest a little emotional. It was a beautiful portrayal of a beautifully mad man. I feel emotional after watching it. It spoke to me on so many levels. What would happen if we just let go and have in to the voices in our heads and ignored societies restraints? This was what happens.<br/><br/>Hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt. Heath Ledger looks like Bonzo the clown compared to this. As for Old mate from suicide squad he needs to never do another one.

540," Not a Joker film, however...
"," I guess the people not happy with this film expected a typical ""Joker"" movie. It's not. It's a film about the man who 'becomes' the Joker. A character study. This is not a feel good movie and don't expect to leave the cinema feeling happy. It's depressing, it's bleak and it's quite uncomfortable to watch at points. It has a constant fog of dread hanging over it that's heavy.
You feel sorry for this person, probably even root for him and that's a real weird thing as we know what he eventually becomes, but I suspect that was the point.
The music score is outstanding, adding massively to the film in no other way I can think of than how the track from Jaws impacted that film so much.
The filmography is also top not notch.
Phoenix is absolutely electric, you cannot take your eyes off him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, he might as well pack up and forget about it. He could do no more.
Best film I've seen in a long time, which is a weird thing as, again, you don't leave with a feel good vibe, but it's all the better for it.
Outstanding. "
541," A perfect tribute to the Joker!
"," The character of Joker received much more love even though being an antagonist in The Dark Knight Trilogy. Todd Philips did a phenomenal job of creating an origin story for Joker and had the guts to present a standalone movie to the public. This movie leaves you in a shock for a moment and makes you think a lot. Some shocking moments that totally grips you, I find no reason as to keep this movie reserved for only 18+
Camera movement and the shots taken are so cool that they deliver a story without a single dialogue being said. This movie keeps you glued to the screen till the end credits roll in.<br/><br/>It is a must watch for all Joker Fans and I believe the count of these fans will increase all the more! "
542," Do i need to say more OUTSTANDING
"," Phoenix showed me what it is to be a joker. i watched the whole movie with heath in mind.one scene actually showed me heath . the transformation is brilliant. mother sentiment is beautiful.
Gripped me from the beginning.Arthur fleck /Joker is definitely will be in mind for a long time.
much awesome direction from todd phillips. Stunner "

", This movie is an absolute master piece. I have always related myself to the Joker and this movie mirrors how I feel on a day-to-day basis. This movie could not have been made any better. 10/10 Why s0 s3r10s? we really do live in a society. 
545," Brilliant film, difficult watch.
"," First let me start by saying that this film is absolutely award season material. The tone, music, story and jaw dropping performance by Phoenix should be seen by anyone who is a fan of film.
Having said that, this is one of the darkest films I have ever seen. There is little to grab onto for anyone who is an optimist or likes neat happy stories. It's a difficult watch, that for the excellent story and performance by Joakim Phoenix would have many not lasting until the final credits. I'm so glad I saw this movie, would certainly recommend this movie but i felt upon leaving the theater that I needed to wash my brain and would not view it again for a good long while. "
546," Tough watch, but solid film
"," The entire movie is well done, entirely plausible for someone struggling with mental illness to spiral out of control given the circumstances. Just be warned that it's a tough slog through two hours that will leave you questioning society and maybe even your very own self. "
547," Unreal
"," Before you go to watch the movie you think it's gonna be overhyped, but no it lives up to all expectations! Firstly the acting is amazing amazing Mr. Phoenix may just get shortlisted for the Oscar IMO! The plot packs a punch at every twist and every turn, for me there was never ever a dull moment. I'm not going to go into much detail you have to see it to believe it an absolute masterpiece! THATS LIFE. "
548," A movie you could watch again and again
"," I'll be honest , I didn't think Joaquin Phoenix was going to be right for the role, I kept thinking of his role in Signs and Gladiator when I first heard that he would be playing the joker several months ago. DC having changed direction with its movies and flavour , the joker Heath Ledger played was a new level of amazing that probably wouldn't have ever been matched but I think that dark and chaotic feel really came out with this movie, It made you really empathise for the joker .it felt very real and it showed how Gotham created the joker .<br/><br/>Great movie , best I've watched all year. "
549," More outstanding than the hype!
"," A masterpiece! Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a pathetic loser in Gotham's fractured society circa early 1980s. By day a clown-for-hire and by night an aspiring stand-up comic Being a successful comedian he could better care for his sick elderly mother living in a rundown apartment. Arthur has a neurological malady that has him breaking out in screeching laughter at inopportune situations. Suffering humiliation and raw despair, his comedy is flat and tends to lead to violence. When the dysfunctional comic gets his hands on a gun discovers what talent he possess is not for comedy. One bad decision after another brings Fleck to the center of a chain reaction of chaos giving a new origin myth of Batman's notable supervillain opponent...The Joker!.<br/><br/>Phoenix's performance is pure brilliance. Also featured are: Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Shea Willingham, Frances Conroy and Brett Cullen. "
550," Masterpiece
"," I can't imagine this Joker fight with a superhero. Like a DC or a Marvel movies nowdays
But have to continue this masterpiece. "
551," Horribly brilliant, I wish I could unsee this film and watch it again.
"," Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, this is the best movie you will see this year.
This movie is a visual treatise on mental heath, abuse and social marginalisation. It has not much to do with DC and the fictional character. It perfectly explores how a human being can unravel into a sociopath. They could have easily called it 'Making a madman' or something.<br/><br/>Not sure why they picked the 1980s but it worked well, the music is excellent and quite diverse in parts. Grimy downtrodden NY/Gotham looks awesome and suits the story.<br/><br/>Heath Ledger was excellent previously but this film is rooted in brutal reality and it is so different to everything that came before that it is justified as a standalone masterpiece. "
552," Magnificent
"," After the credits started rolling I sat in my chair thinking is this real? Did they really make such a movie? Are they even capable of making movies like this? This is easily the best movie I have watched in God knows how many years. Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar "
553," A cinematic achievement in the 100 years of cinema.

554," Not only is this a masterpiece, but Phoenix totally rivals Ledger
", Saw this movie in the after noon the week after it's release. Yea very disturbing and unsettling but what do you expect from a movie that has a mentally psycho clown in the front and center? I freaking loved every minute of this movie. Even Gotham looked fantastic and I think this is the best looking Gotham ever. Sorry Chris Nolan even though you made the best Batman films. Phoenix really sold it. His portrayal of the Joker was completely realistic and all of his laughs were so well done. The story was great as well. I highly recommend this film 
555," WTF is wrong with the media
"," Everything that has to be praised has. Joaquin's performance and psychological angle. But, the media seems to think the message of the movie is to spread violence and chaos. It's not, the message is to show kindness and compassion to others because you're negative actions could create a new joker. "
556," Masterpiece - Joaquin deserves the Oscar
"," Best Movie of the year. A must see for all cinema fans. Joaquin's performance is mind blowing. Joker is ""the rare comic book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world"". I see it as a good representation for today's bullying and how evil, we are as human beings. "
557," In the presence of true genius
"," I left the theater stunned speechless. There really isn't an adequate way to describe Phoenix's genius portrayal of the Joker. I can say there were an abundance of moments when the hair on my arms literally stood up, moments when I could not breathe. See this movie for no other reason than to watch the mastery of his work. We will never meet or know a character like Joker, but Phoenix will bring you as close as you can be to true madness without losing your life. If he does not receive the Oscar for this role, it is only because of fear. "
558," Jaw Dropping!
"," From beginning to end, Joker will have all of your attention and you will be blown away. An origin for the ages! Dark, stark, harsh and real. "

"," A brilliant use of current problems in capitalist societies, sheer the rich want to get even richer and so they demand governments and councils use austerity on the masses to fuel tax cuts for the rich.
One specific result is the cuts to services that help those with mental illness. Hence Joaquin Phoenix's character depends into an abyss from which the Joker emerges.

"," Eversince Phoenix was attached to play the iconic Joker, I was eagerly waiting for this film. I had high expectations in terms of acting in the film and I was completely blown away after seeing it. This film is the best of the year and will be a cult classic in coming years. Direction is near perfect and cinematography is beautifully poetic as expected from a DC movie. You dive into the 80s Gotham and see the world through Arthur's eyes. You witness his transformation into the Joker and the reasons behind it. The end of the movie will make you think what's real and what's fantasy as they say joker has a multiple origin stories. Not sure about Best Picture but expect Academy Award for the Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix. "
572," Current and essential viewing
",
573," Deserve Oscar
"," By far the best movie this year. This should be the starting story of creating the Joker. It's supposed to make a new movie where it relaxes that tension and creates a sick mind of something resembling the Heath ledger joker. Where he becomes a psychopath but leads a group of people off the street and is the most evil supervillain. This type of dancing smoke bomb, pistol and all those magician clown stuff that go with it. With some kind of horror puzzle mix, but it hasn't been copied. "
574," An all time classic was just made.
"," Loved it. Hard to describe. It is rare these days that they make a movie that is more art than commercial. Phoenix's acting is sublime. He makes you feel familiar with the character. Like you know him personally, feel his pain.
This is going to go down as an all time classics and one of the darkest movies of our era. "
575," A must see Drama\Thriller movie
"," It's rare for me to give a movie 10 stars, but Joker is totally worth it.
It is a very strong drama movie that won't let you move your eyes for a second. the music and sounds affects are genius,
adding a lot to the general atmosphere - first when you get to know the Joker
and how everything is going horribly wrong.
It got to the part of the movie that there are supposedly comedy parts, but the director wants you to feel how it is wrong and not really funny.
The movie really make you get to know the joker's personality and creeps you out.
I watched it yesterday and I still get chills up my spine thinking of some of the scenes. "

"," For years is No Country for Old Men my #1 movie of all time. Anton Chigurh still makes me freak out every time he flips his coin. Is not different in this movie.
Actually I have the same feeling watching Joker and the second time I went to the movie it felt like it was even faster ended, which is a good thing.
Jomer is raw, painfull and has a very good message to the world. If you don't get your eyes opened after watching this, it can be the other critics got their message right, which is to not let you see what's going on 'til today.<br/><br/>About No Country for Old Men: it still has a special place in my heart, but I am pretty sure Joker will stay as #1 for a long time.

590," UNBELIEVABLE! Ignore critic reviews
"," Despite the fact that I went into this film with very high expectations I was still blown out of the water. Joaquin was amazing, the cinematography was outstanding and the writing was so perfectly linked to Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. How this is rated poorly by critics blows my mind it clearly shows that critics are biased. Some bad reviews spoke about how the film was too dark and sadistic but that's merely the whole point of joker. He portrays a sadistic psychopath who has been pushed around in an unforgiving place and causes him to rebel. 10/10 best film of the year. "
591," I just wanna say
"," This movie is an absolute piece of art I've never been Soo happy and thrilled to see a movie until this
it's defrent and real and just amazing "
592," People who understand love this film
"," I've heard a handful of people say this is a bad film
That's there opinion fair enough
Joachim Phoenix is amazing in this to the point I think he is a better joker than Heath Ledger which is a bold statement as I loved Heath as the joker
Phoenix takes this role and runs with it<br/><br/>I could watch over and over "
593," Something refreshingly different from DC
"," Despite being a DC movie, this is not your typical superhero vs. villain CGI fest.
This is a film about a man with mental illness who has suffered abuse, neglect and intolerance and his eventual decline into criminal insanity.
If you enjoy movies like Scorsese's Taxi Driver or King of Comedy, then this is for you. If your expecting another Dark Knight, you will be disappointed.
It's set in a beautifully shot dark and bleak Gotham City and is an absolute masterclass in acting from Joaquin Phoenix. "
594," Oscar-worthy and Movie of the Decade
"," This movie is truly a modern masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix does justice to Joker where Heath Ledger left off. But I wouldn't want to compare both their performances as many have already said, ""It would be like comparing apples to oranges."" But I at least know that Heath Ledger can rest easy in heaven knowing Joaquin brought the character under a new light with his phenomenal performance. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have really outdone themselves with this new take on The Joker. Joaquin and Todd bring a whole new aspect to Joker that has never really been talked about before, tackling the issue and importance of mental illness and a few other problems with modern society. And to address all the fear-mongering the media throws towards this movie, ignore it. Most of it isn't even relevant towards the actual movie and much of it are lies. I couldn't recommend another movie to watch over Joker. This movie will not disappoint. In fact, it goes above expectations (surely went over mine). Case in point, please consider giving this film a watch. I can't recommend this movie enough. "

"," Joker
2019

director : Todd Phillips
starring: Joaquin phoenix,Robert de niro, Zaze beetz,Frances Conray,Brett Cullen<br/><br/>overall rating 99/100<br/><br/>The joker is about mentally unstable Arthur Fleck ( Joaquin phoenix) on trying to reach his dream of becoming a stand up comedian. But when things in his life dont go his way and his mental health deteriorates the joker clown is unleashed.Wow this movie was a masterpiece in every component i never thought my favourite movie of the year would be a DC movie but this film really shocked me at its artistry and brilliance lets talk about why this is.<br/><br/>First of all the film had an absolutely incredible score. Wow the soundtrack really left an impact in the most important scenes in the film. When there was something uncomfortable or important happening on the screen the score got louder and louder. And i especially enjoyed the score when Joaquian phoenix became the complete joker. It made you excited for what he was going to do and added important to the final act.<br/><br/>Next the film was actually pretty funny. Some of the comedy jokes within the film mostly landed. And Robert de niro added excellent comedic moments to the movie as well as his fantastic acting. His sarcastic comments definitely drew some laughs from me despite him suffering the repercussions of making these jokes about Arthurs character i just thought he added a nice dynamic to the movie.<br/><br/>Next i thought the movie had excellent character development for the lead role and the female character (Zaze Beetz) was a great addition to the movie as well. I thought Zazes character did a really good job with what little screen time she had. She kind of was the main reason for Arthur not going completely insane for half of the movie and if she wasn't a character he would of went mad much more quickly. Next Arthurs character development was fantastic. To see his slow decent into madness throughout the film really left an impact with me. So many things in his life was going wrong that from my perspective i understood why he snapped. From losing his job to realising dark secrets about his mum it was really interesting to see how his mental health slowly got worse and worse.<br/><br/>Next the plot twist and final act were fantastic and definitely the best parts of the movie aside from Joaquin phoenix being fantastic. I thought the plot twist of Sophie never actually being beside Arthur was a really interesting twist. As she was keeping him relatively sane throughout the movie but with this twist it just proves he was mad all along so that was great. And the final act was just fantastic when Arthur transformed completely into the joker it was just fantastic. He had a fantastic script he looked fantastic and terryfying and the events left me satisfied with the ending. The gore also added a lot of impact to a lot of the scenes and added a fatality realistic portrayal of violence in modern society.<br/><br/>Next the film had an excellent balance between sympathy and fear of Arthurs character. With all the events that was happening to him at the beginning and the fact that he couldn't control his laughing to it being a condition you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But this sympathy soon turned to fear of what he is capable off when he is off his medication and the film did a brilliant job of balancing these two out therefore being tonally consistent. Adding onto that the film executed an incredible tense and uncomfortable tone throughout. Wow this film had you on edge throughout. Whether it was the haunting laugh of Arthur. Or his disformed body. The film really put you in a place of discomfort which i loved as that was i believe the directors desired passive reaction for the audience.<br/><br/>Next the cinematography and visuals were stunning. There was some really stunning shots in this film largely close ups of the joker that really were fantastic to look at. The films colour palette was fantastic as well it was just a very well shot and directed movie.<br/><br/>Now next is not a negative more like a realisation. Now i understand why this film is causing some controversy in some aspects but a lot of people are taking it to far. I can see how it can be taken the wrong way in terms of supporting violence and anybody who watches the film in a similar situation to Arthur may take the film very literally but in my opinion this was not the films main goal. As i believe it a more harsh and realistic portrayal of how dangerous modern society is and this themes was portrayed excellently. And really made me think and question about how mad and dangerous society and the whole world is in this day and age.<br/><br/>Now for my final two positives. Firstly i loved that they involved young batman in this story. His interactions with the joker was fantastic and it saddened me that they wont meet again on screen. And seeing his parents deaths again was sad to see but also bought back nostalgia from previous batman movies.<br/><br/>And finally the best part of this film was of course Joaquin Phoenix. Wow he was truly incredible here. He really put every escene of his being into making his interpretation of the joker his own. And boy did he do a good job. He found a way to differentiate himself from all the other portrayals and matches the legendary performance of Heath Ledger. He was commited to the role and clearly lost a lot of weight. And his acting was the reason the film had such a uncomfortable tone as it was so believable. You could see the madness in his eyes and that intensity and madness got more and more recognisable as the movie went on he definitely deserves at least an oscar nomination but really a win for this.<br/><br/>Overall the joker is a true cinematic masterpiece that is pretty much perfect. Filled with excellent performances/themes and visuals and it really proves that the standard of DC movies is improving rapidly. "

", I can't believe what happening here .. all I can say that's the movie is a masterpiece. 
599," Amazing masterpiece of 2019
"," This is kind of movies you watch over and over again, the soundtrack, the vintage footage of the 70s'/80s'
And above all the acting of Juaquin phoenix ... stunning ü§°üë∫ü§° "
600," Must watch if you like character study films or find mental illnesses fascinating.
"," It's very interesting to watch a talented actor depict a compelling and unique character falling into madness. This kind of movie heavily depends on the actor's performance so I was worried if Joaquin could pull it off, but he really exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>One of those movies that I couldn't get enough of after watching it, don't think I'll get easily tired of discussing about the it and watching clips or the whole thing again. "
601," Outstanding performance
"," The movie is too dark, awkwardness leaks in every single minute of it...<br/><br/>However, it delivers a very clear and strong message that cannot be mistaken.<br/><br/>The purely genuine performance of the Joker adds to its darkness &amp; beauty. "
602," Outstanding Movie
", I went along to this thinking it was a Marvel type offering. How wrong I was. Totally immersed in this film to the point of being overwhelmed by emotion.<br/><br/>One of the best movie experiences I have ever had.

"," MASTERPIECE!!! The acting, cinematography, script, and the original score is phenomenal!!! This movie is triumph. "
605," Dripping with style and substance...
"," Todd Phillip's Joker is strange, gripping, and unlike the films it shares its comic book category. Grounded by a world that's hard to look at, littered with sure-to-be-iconic character shots, fueled by a heart breaking performances, and sewn together by a near perfect score; Joker is sure to both divide and captivate audiences for decades to come "
606," Decade defining masterpiece. Anything short of an Oscar would be a disservice.

608," The movie of the past few years
", We needed a movie like this one for a long time and we got a movie that deserves all the wait. 
609," Outstanding
"," The Joker has always been Batman's main nemesis and he was also the single best character in the best Batman movie ever made: Dark Knight-so why shouldn't he have his own movie? Of course, this version of Joker won't be Heath Ledger nor Jack Nicholson, and thank God it's not Jared Leto. This rendition of Joker would be Joaquin Phoenix and I think he did a fine job.<br/><br/>This movie was the making of Joker--his backstory. What they did so well was create a mood. From the beginning the mood was set as somber, dark, despondent. Through the music, the camera shots, and the setting you got a feel of the environment that hatched the Joker. Gotham City was such that any person could have gone mad especially someone with just the right push.<br/><br/>The Joker was not born from a big bang like so many superheroes and supervillains. He was born from a series of small infractions, tiny iniquities, micro-offenses. Each little occurrence chipped away at his already fragile psyche.<br/><br/>By the time he'd reached Joker level insanity, it wasn't a flood gate that opened within him. His personality didn't dramatically change. We merely saw the man that we had glimpses of throughout the entire movie. When the door opened for the Joker to come out, he didn't storm out with megalomaniac level schemes and plans, he walked out with one simple plan and one simple target that just so happened to light the wick to a powder keg that was Gotham City.<br/><br/>The Joker didn't create the conditions under which he was made and under which Gotham City became a war zone. The Joker was what many of the Gothamites were waiting for and didn't know it. The city was simmering and bubbling just waiting to boil over when the Joker provided that final spark.<br/><br/>It was brilliantly done. The pacing, although slow at times, was even. The story was very cohesive with no noticeable gaps or flaws. The setting and the mood was pitch perfect. And the performance by Phoenix, which was a different Joker from his predecessors, was magnifique. He wasn't the effervescent Joker that we may be familiar with and it made sense. He was passive-aggressive, slightly muted, definitely delusional, and set to explode. He was outstanding. "
610," Masterpiece
"," This movie is a masterpiece. Best movie I've seen my whole life. Joaquin Phoenix is just beyond amazing, the best acting I've ever seen from any actor ever! Must see. "
611," Masterclass performance & Screenplay written ever...
", We all have known joker character from many movies(Especially my favorite Heath Ledger) but this one is the B!!!(I m not going to say that but hard to digest &amp; the hype is real) Well...what a character development... Specially the transformation to JOKER... Hats off to Joaquin Phoenix.. This guy deserves an Oscar really... 
612," A hug
"," I did not find a single scene that I did not like, the photography in this movie is excellent. I cried in the beginning, I only laughed 3 or 4 times (no forced jokes) and i left the cinema complete. You see the side b of gotham's past and although you can empathize with Arthur but only the politically correct thing could complain about such a jewel, it bothers them but we love it. The comic genre needs more movies like this and less comedy. "
613," AMAZING
"," I mean what the hell...
This is definitely the most amazing movie ever made about a comicbook supervillain.
The character development, the turning points, everything is just freaking amazing about this movie.
That ending, joker dancing on car's hood, putting that smile with his blood on his face. Goosebumps...
And don't get me started on Phoenix's performance.
Phoenix definitely deserves an oscar for his performance in this movie.
The best 2019 movie so far... "
614," ""You wouldn't get it""
", This movie is only boring to those that are used to action. This movie for those who really know the Joker. That this movie was a beautiful narrative told from his perspective. Highly recommend to keep that in mind if you don't know if you should watch it. 
615," I cried...i even felt empathy at one point..
"," I cant even start with this... Its simply a remarkable work...one that i feel so thankful with l√≠fe to be able to experience...
Joaqu√≠n Is something out of this World.. i dont know what the critics are smoking with their nonsensical reviews.. "
616," Outstanding! One Of The Greatest Films I've Seen In Years!!
"," I had avoided all the trailers and press on this film and in all honestly, didn't expect much from it. DC films haven't been the greatest over the past lot of years and here we are again with WB trying to go down another route to try and make something of it...<br/><br/>Well - I'm only glad they did.<br/><br/>Joker is quite simply one of the finest pieces of film I have seen in a long time - especially from Hollywood, which isn't too often. From Joaquin's incredible performance (just amazing), to the stunning cinematography and score, I just can't think of a single moment that lost me.<br/><br/>Well done Todd Phillips and team, and well done Joaquin for the greatest performance of the Joker ever! "
617," One of The best Drama Movies of all time
"," Masterpiece... , The acting is brilliant , the story is enjoyable , The Movie is just One of the best Movies Ever Made "
618," A masterpiece & brand new look at DC World.
"," A real masterpiece. I have been waiting for this movie since Joaquin Phoenix's laughing trailer came out, and i am more than happy to see well worth the wait. Phoenix's performance is hard to forget and we are lucky to see this performance with a great script on the big screen.<br/><br/>We watched Batman saving Gotham and sad background of Bruce Wayne's life million times. This film shows and asks a simple question; what if Gotham deserves Joker more than Batman?<br/><br/>Lastly; Joaquin Phoenix should win Oscar after this. I don't think any other option would be fair. "
619," Modern masterpiece - has got right under my skin!
",
620," Possibly the best movie of all time
",
621," It changed my life
"," If you just smile your life would be happier ....
this movie takes my mind and all in in my head are happy cause you mustn't give a damn about others when they make fun of you and say bad things to make you sad . Because that's life us the song of Sinatra's says some people get their kicks stomping on a dream<br/><br/>I don't say go kill others like joker but don't ignore bad behavior from others just strike back and have a smile !<br/><br/>That's life gentlemen "
622," As a fan of comics and good cinema, Wow!
"," As a lifelong fan of western comics, anime, TV sci-fi and cult &amp; masterpiece movies, this film truly is a historical landmark of cinema. Kudos to Mr. Phoenix and Mr. Phillips, they have achieved something no one else had until now in the superhero genre, true art (Except maybe Nolan's and Ledger's Dark Knight).
Superhero-wise, this Joker has been brought to us under an entirely different light. He makes you feel sorry for him, mad at society for having forsaken such a hurt man. Appaled of how the system can abandon a sick and lonely person in the time of most need. Truly despicable are crowds of people who mock a man dressed as a clown with a smile, but who cries inside. A cruel, bitter and tasteless joke this is. "
623," Great movie
",
624," Who's the real joker?
"," I don't understand the high ratings. I went to the cinema with high expectations, only to discover that the movie was slow as anything and was almost finished before the first killing happened. It was a dreadful time having to wait for something to happen.
But yes, once the movie was finished and I finally walked out, I got the cosmic joke; I was the joker, trusting the reviews and leaving disappointed in disbelief I actually paid for watching it. "
625," For those who gave out score under 10
"," This is not a normal superhero movie where you will expect glamorous CG. But it definitely gives you more thrill and excitement than the other superhero movie. A smile, a bully, a setback, a betray, a misunderstanding, a confusion, a lie, a chance, these are what life makes of. Anyone who gave out score lower than 9 repeatedly reported the lack of excitement from the movie, that's because you guys are lack of life experience to feel so. "
626," Unbelievably perfect
",
627," Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?

628," A masterpiece
"," This is one of those once in a lifetime movies that will make you move uncomfortably in your seat. You want to chear for him, you understand how he got to where he is, but your logic and morals don't let you connect. Truly a masterpiece, and fantastic acting. Life is cruel, people are cruel, and this movie slaps you in the face with it. "
629," Go watch it with an open mind
"," I personally loved the movie, you have to go in with an open mind. I agree that you can't compare Heath's Joker to Joaquin's. They're both unique and spectacular in their own way "
630," Best Joker Origin Movie
"," Amazing Acting , plot , directing everything is perfect .
one of the best joker origin movie "
631," Best comic book inspired movie, ever
"," The depth to which Joaquin Pheonix plays Joker is actually disturbing. This Joker is so very different than the gold standard Heath Ledger. In Heath's Joker, we feel unpredictable and scared or terrified, but Joaquin potrays a Joker which isn't as terrifying but it's downright eerie, disturbing and unnerving. It makes you sympathize with Joker, the most despicable character in comic universe, and makes you wanna help him. It doesn't make you justify Joker's choices but it will make you understand them, and by the end you will want to justify Arthur's actions, not Joker's but Arthur's. You wouldn't be able to justify them but you will have a hard time to condemn them. Also the story leaves you at an uncertain point open to any interpretation, just like the charachter and the comics it has drew inspiration from. It is a mind boggling, thorough, disturbing and unnerving charachter study that makes you question not only society but yourself too. "
632," Goosebumps!
"," This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just some mindless over the top action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is surely grabbing an Oscar for this one! What a performance, what a movie. "
633," Make me feel like I am in this movie
"," Love how Phoenix express himself as Joker, absolutely will watch this movie again. "
634," Outstanding
"," I made an IMDb account just to write a review for this film and give it the 10 star rating it deserves. JP plays the role of Joker perfectly. Dark, disturbed, lonely, angry, he just nails every aspect and his performance in this film just has to be seen. He 100% has to win the best actor Oscar when awards season arrives. I was hooked from the very first scene and was enthralled throughout. What an outstanding piece of cinema. Amazing. The best film I have seen in a long, long time. "
635," Perfection.
"," Watching this film was fantastic, you were so immersed in it and everything that happend had some real impact, to some even, relatable problems. The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was good and the way Arthur tries to be positive and find solace and happiness, everything is only made worse by lies, no help, no friends no nothing.<br/><br/>The reason for why for me it is a 10/10 is because i've been in a similar situation before, no friends, don't know how to get help or what to do. Sometimes these simple problems cause the worst of epidemics, ex: violence, mass shootings, suicides and so on.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty much a fantastic depiction of mental illness and ""society"".
Watch it, it'll open your eyes to alot of things and topics you've never been able to grasp in its entirety. "
636," That's Life!
"," I have no words really? I went to the cinema to see it for the second time today, it's even better now. I mean honestly, how can a person nail such an iconic role that good? Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker the we have always wanted. Don't get me wrong, Heath Ledger's acting will never be forgotten. BUT OH MY GOD!
Joaquin's performance is breathtaking! There's a little bit of everything in there. But one of the things that I love the most about his acting in this movie, is how he succeeds showing multiple feelings at once. You can see Arthur's sadness while he's laughing. YOU feel his broken heart.
The directors of this movie show you the life of a schizophrenic, lonely and a psychotic person. I think we all don't really know who's side were on, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? "

"," The Joker is basically a film about a man dealing with severe mental illness. You will watch him go about his daily life struggling to cope and deal with the world around him. You will see how his illness affects him, it's quite unsettling.<br/><br/>The Joker is dark and depressing throughout. It's an Oscar winning performance by Joaquin phoenix.<br/><br/>This film is about the Joker before he becomes the Joker. It's his struggle with mental illness while he is trying to find his place in the world and become the comic book character that takes on Gotham City. I don't think most people quite realise this before they go to see it. "

648," Future cult movie.
"," 'Joker' is raw, real. It does not seek to impress but it does, and in what way. Todd Phillips manages to give a new air to the genre of superheroes, and Joaquin Phoenix is sublime in his performance... Not only does he understand the complicated character but he makes it his own. Something very dificult considering the iconic performances of Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. "
649," Hauntingly Beautiful
"," Personally I was not ready for the intensity and the realistic nature of Jokers mental health. This version of Joker stands on its own and should not be compared to DC or Marvel. It's a Drama. I have never had a ""Comic Book"" movie give way to all the emotions I felt, questioning every part of humanity and how we treat each other makes a difference. I applaud this movie for asking hard questions. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic. It's a 10 stars in my book. "
650," Amazing
"," This movie was just absolutely stunning. I would recommend this movie to about anyone. Regardless of controversy, this movie is as good as it gets! "
651," 'JOKER' made me fall in love with the Cinema once again....
"," I was so excited for this movie ever since it was announced. And today I finally watched it. I travelled around 100 kms just to watch this movie. Because I just don't want to miss this one. And ofcourse I loved the movie. It's once in a lifetime movie. It is Dark, disturbing, intense. Yet undeniably a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix without any doubt is a real gem of the cinema. This one is not for people who like typical commercial movies and who don't like dark, intense and violent theme.
Robert de Niro's role was short but he did a great job as expected. The movie keeps getting dark. I loved the pace, direction &amp; cinematography. And the BGM is just fantabulous. From the moment when he puts a smile on his face with blood shows that Arthur Fleck is dead now and The Clown Prince of Crime is born. From that moment, He is no longer just a shadow, he's the light of those people to stand up against the oppressors of Gotham. Truly, I feel so overwhelmed by watching this movie. Loved it. "
652," Unbelievably good.. so much better than I expected!
"," I've just got back from the cinema and I'm still in complete shock how incredible this film is. The acting from Joaquin moved me in parts and felt uncomfortable but incredibly gripping at the same time, just amazing. I've never felt this way from any of the previous related films, but this one is very different. You truly feel empathy for Arthur even though he has none himself and this film not only helps to put the whole backstory into perspective in a way that's never been imagined before, but also truly unique and intense while retaining moments of dark humour even in some of the most depraved scenes. Absolute masterpiece! "
653," Joker is vary good
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime "
654," Amazing acting
"," You will feel the joker alternation of his metal condition, when you watch moive "
655," Definitely the BEST movie of 2019... What a story!!! MASTERPIECE!!!
"," I will start with the obvious... There is NO comparison with EndGame... Different movies, different styles of cinematography..
The whole thing is just a mirroring to the society at the current time.
Those who have power &amp; money stomp over the ""weak"" but cant see what these ""weak"" are capable of.....
The scene in the train with the 3 bullies is just WONDERFUL...
For the main character, I think that Phoenix goes it to another level. NIckolson was a caricature, Ledger was a maniac, but here we have all the aspects of the Clown Prince of Crime gathered.... Isanity, Paranoia, Pain, Suffering, of course Vengeance and cold blooded reactions...
In the 120 mins there is such a progression in Joker as a person &amp; character, min by min, scene by scene...
Beautiful direction &amp; photography.
There is no discussion for the Oscar of 1st male actor. If the movie is for 10/10, JP is for 12/10. "
656," Glorious interpretation
"," What an amazing interpretation by Phoenix!
Also the plot is brilliant. Well done! "
657," Performing this far is not easy. It's a masterpiece.
"," The fact that the film has the best giggle so classic of Joker's hysterical laugh makes this film deserving of an Oscar. It certainly is a masterpiece, far outperforming Dark Knight and actually deserving a place beside Taxi Driver. "
658," Every movie should be this good
"," In my opinion Joker is a flawless movie. The dedicated way Joaquin Phoenix portrays the character is so unique you just have to appreciate it. The character development throughout the movie is some of the best I've ever seen and the cinematography was absolutely stunning. I was hooked for the 2 hours the movie lasted. I think if you appreciate movies as a form of art you must think this is one of the best movies out there, if you're just looking for a superhero movie to watch then you probably won't like it that much. "
659," Wow...just wow
"," Probably the best, most compelling movie I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix is a LEGEND!!! "
660," Masterpiece..
", It's been a long time since Hollywood has put out a good film. This one will make you explore feelings you didn't want to and feel good about it. The story with Phoenix performance is historical. Every aspect of this was perfect. I can't believe how great this movie is. 
661," ""Joker"" is the pinnacle of comic book film
"," Now that the Joker has had a couple of legitimate outings, I think it's clear to say that Joker may be that best outing. I know that Heath Ledger is known to have the best performance, but wow does Phoenix deserve an Oscar. His character goes through such a terrifying and disturbing character arc that you don't want to see, yet can't look away. All the performances are sensational (including a couple of twists) and a brilliant ending to wrap everything together. The score matches it clearly, taking that ""Joker"" persona very clearly. I can't think of anybody that can match what this character may be. If Phoenix wins an Oscar, then this means that the Joker is one of the most complex and interesting character ever in film. All in all, Joker makes the viewer believe that everything he does is okay (but it's clearly not) and keeps you on the edge of your seat through brilliant direction and a sensational character study. "
662," Best movie of the year so far
"," Phoenix gives an absolutely phenomenal performance as the joker, in my opinion the best that has ever been put to screen. The story goes places you would never expect it to and plays around with the Batman/Gotham city lore/characters in interesting ways.<br/><br/>My only slight problem is that I think it takes a little too much inspiration from taxi driver, and that a certain character feels wasted or unimportant but they're not in it for that much anyway "
663," 10/10
"," One of the most incredible performances I've ever seen in the theater. This acting, the brilliant shots, haunting score, ...this movie deserves every award. "
664," I want to smile and cry at the same time
"," The title of my review is how I imagine the joker would want me to feel.
I want to smile as the directing and acting is flawless. You believe every scene and quite frankly you would be an a****** to try and pick holes in it.
The crying is how at the centre of it, Arthur actually has a good heart, but was screwed over by society, work and family. What you're left with is the result of someone who looks at life with a glass half full coming to the relation that life is actually a glass half empty. "

", Very nice in my opinion it is the best story about the joker 
668," Good Acting Doesn't Make it a 10
"," I enjoyed the movie it has a grittiness and indeed the acting is top notch. My problem is the story. Though the story of how the Joker becomes the Joker it doesn't do much else. I would expect the story to contain something more, some great lines, memorable moments something to keep the tension heightened but it doesn't. Yes it's well acted, and one of my friends tried comparing it to Taxi Driver but coming out of the movie I asked him to provide me one memorable quote/line and he couldn't (I can provide you several for Taxi Driver that I watched over 20 years ago). So yeah it's a good movie and worth seeing but don't expect a lot to happen, and definitely it's no masterpiece. I gave it a solid 7. "

",
671," Troubling, dark, engrossing
"," Was never into the whole comic book thing (the last Batman I saw was played by Michael Keaton) but this film was sold to me on the basis that it's more a portrayal of one man's descent into madness than a CGI-fuelled superhero adventure.<br/><br/>Comparisons with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy certainly helped (not to mention the presence of the star of both of those films, Robert De Niro), as well as the leading man, an actor of whom I'm quickly becoming a devoted fan, Joaquin Phoenix. With all this considered, I armed myself with the extremely scant knowledge of the Batman universe that I possess and off to the pictures I went.<br/><br/>Well, what I and the packed cinema saw was an acting tour de force. I never saw Heath Ledger's legendary portrayal of the titular character but I really don't know how it can beat Phoenix's portrayal here. Admittedly, I think I'm right in saying that Ledger portrayed Joker whereas for most of this film, Phoenix is portraying Arthur Fleck and perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much. There's no denying that Joker is an intensely interesting character but for me, seeing the human behind the face-paint and his tumultuous unravelling is far more fascinating than the monster he becomes.<br/><br/>Much has been made of how dark this film is and that is certainly true; how it is a 15 certificate is more a sign of the times than anything because this film pulls no punches. The violence is, at times, extremely graphic and the portrayal of a man so troubled is often deeply unsettling. All of which, set against a relentlessly grim Gotham backdrop, is utterly necessary to give the film the atmosphere and the feel it requires but I did wonder how this film will sit in a franchise that, while not explicitly aimed at kids, nevertheless appeals to younger audiences the way Batman always has. 'The Dark Knight Rises' was a 12A; Joker should really be an 18 and trust me, you really don't want to be taking your kids to see it if you want them to get a good night's sleep afterwards.<br/><br/>What isn't in any doubt is the extraordinary performance Joaquin Phoenix delivers in the title role. He has always been a very dependable actor and has given some incredible performances over the years ('Walk The Line' and 'You Were Never Really Here' to name but two) but here, one gets the sense that he is throwing absolutely everything he has at the role. As well as a physical transformation (he clearly lost an awful lot of weight to attain the skeletal physique required), Phoenix brings a manic intensity to the part that is, at times, hugely uncomfortable to watch but is never anything less than utterly fascinating and absorbing.<br/><br/>It is unnerving because even for someone like me who has such a flimsy knowledge of the Batman story, there is a strange contradiction in the sadness and pity felt for a character who one knows is going to become one of pop culture's great supervillains; a murderous madman who will come to thrive on anarchy, violence, death and destruction. For most of the film though, he isn't Joker, he is Arthur Fleck, a sympathetic character exposed to the violence, the mockery and the ostracisation that those on the edge of society suffer all too often. With what's thrown at him, it is no wonder that he eventually snaps and fights back in the most spectacular and public way.<br/><br/>I might have got even more from this film if I had any interest in the comic book world but it says a lot about Joker that I was able to watch this as a stand-alone film and leave the cinema utterly mesmerised by what I'd seen. Director Todd Phillips' vision aside though, all praise has to go to Phoenix for delivering such a pained, intense, visceral and thrilling performance. In lesser hands, it could have felt cheap and exploitative but not here. I can't say either way whether this is a sensitive portrayal of mental illness but then again, Arthur's specific condition isn't explicitly defined and also, this is a fictional character whose defining feature, his greatest weapon, is that he is ""insane"" (for want of a better word).<br/><br/>Already, there have been debates about whether or not the portrayal is healthy and there are arguments on both sides. I don't know for sure but if nothing else, some good will surely come from increasing the spotlight on what it means to suffer from mental illness. The film itself, while set in a fictional city in an undefined timeframe, does touch upon issues that are seemingly timeless.<br/><br/>The lack of funding or of proper care for those living with mental illness is explicitly referred to in the film and are highlighted as major factors in Arthur's continuing decline. The therapist who just repeats the same questions, the lack of funding for proper care, the constant mockery from those who don't understand; these are all daily battles waged by those living with mental illness. Of course, in reality, said sufferers very, very seldom reach a point whereby they turn violent (or indeed murderous) and wreak revenge on society. Their battle to be heard and to get proper care, however, is all too common.<br/><br/>This is just one debate that the film will ignite but great cinema always does that and for me, 'Joker' is great cinema with a performance at its heart that surely cannot go unrewarded when Awards Season comes around. Certain scenes will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, debates will be had, lines will be quoted and meaning will be attempted to be extracted from what the viewer has seen. THAT is what only great cinema provides.<br/><br/>8.5/10 "

Both did amazingly great job, both presented the role best on its own way, there's no way to decide which one is larger.<br/><br/>Overall, i agree that this movie is not for everyone. And i personally, enjoy this movie truly as an art.

The one who is able to adapt without contradiction to the conditions of a cynical, violent and morally corrupt time, or the one reacting on those conditions with uncompromising insanity, fighting back, using his own weapons of revenge, reflecting world's madness with an insane grimace?
This is the disturbing question the film poses in the figure of The Joker, equally fascinating, frightening and pitifully embodied by Phoenix, an unforgettable performance with great depth and a wide range of emotions: a Travis Bickle for the 21st century, and Robert De Niro himself paying tribute to this 43 years later after his own legendary performance in Taxi Driver.

Of course the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is pure &amp; the movie is very well done.. it has its flaws (I didn't like the face makeup that much, but it's ok, not complaining &amp; didn't agree about a clown being the murderer of Bruce's parents, I mean, it changes a bit of the things) but anyways, this is a must watch movie!

"," JOKER (2019) *** Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Francis Conroy, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Glenn Fleshler, Leigh Gill, Josh Pais, Marc Maron. Interesting but slightly bloated origin story of the arch criminal villain of The DC universe with Phoenix at the top of his game as the much-put-upon Arthur Fleck in Gotham City circa 1981 who reaches his breaking point and a moment of clarity of what his true significant purpose is in life with deadly consequences ensuing. While director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the screenplay with Scott Silver) attempts to get in touch with his inner Scorsese by paralleling his worldview ala Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin (going full meta in even employing De Niro as talk-show host Murray Franklin) with far too many touchstones to count. Phoenix's chameleon-like physicality (shedding over 50 pounds) to give the slightly anemic/skeletal protagonist its spine by tapping into his own Christian Bale ala THE MECHANIC and his eerie, off-settling helpless cackle becomes instantly iconic in the canon of actors who've portrayed this homicidal harlequin.

The acting done by Joaquin Phoenix who played the role of joker was amazing. He was flawless and did proper justice with the character of joker which very few actors were able to do. Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant method actor.

The setting and pace give an absolutely fitting tone to the film. I think it couldn't be done any better, keeping in mind that the protagonist is a psychotic personality with mental issues.
Joaquin couldn't depict Joker in this setting any better and I LOVED his funny, yet manic, yet tragic ""Joker Laugh"". Don't compare this Joker to Heath Ledger's one. Both are different, yet AMAZING.
I have a single complaint about the film and that's why I'm giving it 9/10.
***SPOILERS AHEAD***
When Arthur ends up in Murray's show, they should have made him to actually be able to make people laugh and THEN flip out, starting to shout menacing at society and the media and eventually shoot Murray in the head. It would be so much more climatic and intense. At least for me... "

"," Joker is a origin story of the infamous villian of DC universe. Its a mixture of violence and emotions. After watching this movie i have became a fan of director Todd Phillips (its the same guy who directed the comical triology The Hangover). His idea of presenting the story was fabulous. He knows how to intrigue audience with the story of the film. I have read many review of ths flim saying that the first half is slow but trust me i didn't feel that the first half was slow. First half shows the struggling mental state of Arthur Fleck aka Joker played by Joaquin Phoenix and second half shows his transformation to JOKER.
About Joaquin Phoenix he just showed us a new version of Joker as the character was played by a lot of great actors like Jack Nicholson and my favourite Heath Ledger. Can't imagine how much pressure would be on Mr. Phoenix to play joker but he did a fantastic jobüëè. BGM also adds more feels to this movie.
Conclusion : its a violent movie so very R rated but a must watch. A person need not have comic book knowledge to watch this brilliant peice of art as the movie has very less references to other universe. Everyone can watch this movie. "

744," Don't be SHEEP
"," I don't write a lot of reviews but I felt compelled to do this if only just to put in writing the thoughts in my head..that apparently are a lot different from the thoughts in quite a few other people's heads when it comes to the perception of this movie.<br/><br/>First, in order for you to understand mine or anybody else's critique of this movie, you absolutely need to have seen all of the following movies:
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho
King of Comedy
Fight Club
Taxi Driver
Dark Knight Trilogy
Dog Day Afternoon<br/><br/>So let's do a somewhat categorized approach beginning with the obvious....<br/><br/>Acting: JP does a great job purely as an immersive method actor. He gives it his all and for that he deserves accolades. The few areas where he falters with overacting are actually the fault of the director and the editor for keeping those scenes in, since the scenes itself were repetitive and could have been taken out. The other actors do their job competently. Wait, there were other actors? Yes, there were ! Plenty of poorly written, poorly characterised shell characters that gave the artists no real scope to perform given that their combined screen time was 10%! DeNiro was wasted completely.<br/><br/>Casting: Just because JP did a stellar job does not means he was ideal for the role. Sure, if we take the 'Joker' aspect of it away, then he fits perfectly as a traumatized, declining man. But this is a JOKER origin story, and for THAT, Joaquin is too old! The timelines just don't make sense. The young Bruce Wayne as shown will become Batman after a good 20 years (remember Bruce was a successful older business tycoon before he became Batman) So by that time, this upper-middle aged Joker will be in his 70s? Come on now.
Zazie yas potential but was not given much to do. She did a good job. A legend like DeNiro should have never accepted such a poorly etched caricature role of Murray Franklin.<br/><br/>Character development: Whoa. All the sheep are talking about this and how 'masterful' it was. Look at the movies I have listed above and you will see how much has been copied from them in bits and pieces and jumbled together. Do people forget that at the very start of the movie he was mentally unstable and on seven medications? So his decline from that into a psychotic killer isnt that steep.
The inaccuracies are plenty as well.
Yes, a person can decline in morality, social adaptibility, schizophrenia etc.... however, a person CANNOT suddenly become MORE intelligent. So how does this person who is depicted as a bumbling fool continuously evolve into a sophisticated well-planned killer and eventually become into the character known as the Joker who was a masterful villain?<br/><br/>The laugh: The real Joker is supposed to laugh because he is a cruel and vicious monster and he laughs at his own jokes which are actually quite witty and also laughs at death and the misery he is causing, INTENTIONALLY!! The Joker in this movie laughs because he has a mental disorder and laughs involuntarily?? What the hell.? That deviation alone should make the movie ineligible to be called Joker ..from DC comics. It's simply NOT true to the character.<br/><br/>Story and script flaws : Some already mentioned above. No matter what the lack of funding, patients with mental disorders never ever have their medications taken away, no matter which department shuts down. This has been the case for decades. Even less wealthy countries dont do that.
How does a guy give him a loaded gun for free to protect himself and then screw him over just like that?<br/><br/>Music: Some the older songs were cleverly placed. The score was excellent in its quality however the placement of the music was highly manipulative in order to create a faux dark snd suspeseful aura. If I show you a video of starving children and play melancholy piano violin pieces in the background, you will cry too! Emotional manipulation through clever musical score placement is an old, old trick but the shameless overuse of it in this movie was akin to 70's shock horror flicks.<br/><br/>Direction: All over the place. Todd Philips is trying to be Hitchcock, Scorcese, and Nolan combined and he is not even remotely close to any of them. He steals heavily from their styles but whenever someone does that it almost always creates botched pacing and repetitiveness of scenes, and oh yeah, there is plenty of that.<br/><br/>Story: There is no real plot or story. The key turning points are weak. Even IF for the sake of argument the government takes the medications away from a person with a mental disorder, uh...hello, that person will get worse and out of control, but in this movie he gets smarter and more cunning and calculated? Not possible! The link to Thomas Wayne as his dad was a cheap shot. And how convenient of him to find such a properly thought out letter from his mom who is supposed to be crazy but wrote this very sensible letter that is of such importance, and then forgot to mail it! Haha I was rolling my eyes so hard my eyeballs hurt.<br/><br/>The so-called 'social commentary' : Contrived and oh-so #fake anti-capitalist message. Oh, those rich people behind their iron gates are oh so bad. Boo hoo.. let's protest and riot and life will be so much better! What a sad attempt at cashing in on anti-Trump sentiment. And Oh, the irony. Rich people are bad but thank you Sheep, we are gonna cash out big on this movie... You want to see a real social commentary far far ahead of it's time? Watch The Truman Show.
The sad pathetic irony of the causes of this 'unrest' is sickening. Oh look at this guy. Living in an American city, has an apartment, has free medical care, has A JOB..how many people in the world would die just to have that! But oh look at him, he gets bullied, beat up a bit, (rightfully) fired from a job..(but could have easily worked for a fast food or cafe till his comedian act worked)....but oh no no no, THIS is the limit! Down with the rich, let's kill em all. Let people pay their hard earned money to watch this, while we laugh all the way to the bank and the truly poor people in the world be like 'wtf just happened?'.<br/><br/>Marketing and hype: Wow. I mean really wow. This is a modern day epic example of socially manipulated and engineered mass-hype opinion manipulation. Word of mouth is sometimes beneficial, sometimes not. Remember, gossip and rumors also are a form of Word of mouth. When five of your friends say that a film is a masterpiece, most are going to say that they thought so too, for fear of being ridiculed as someone who is not savvy enough to understand such 'deep' movies.<br/><br/>The other thing is that the comic theme will draw a relatively younger audience as well, many of whom have not seen the above listed movies to catch what I call plagiarism (but if he wants to call it a tribute, even then it's a botched one.) And these folks will flood social media with hyperbole terminology. Epic. Genius. Masterpiece. Legendary. Achivement...yawn, did I miss any?
And so on and on the hype train will go till we are past the Oscars and award season of fake oohs and aaahs and speeches about this pseudo-deep movie. JP should get the award mainly for effort and because he has poor competition this year, but that's about it as far as deserving-ness.<br/><br/>Many have already questioned how this movie had literally thousands of rated 10 reviews on this site even before its premiere? Hmm....I say hmm..<br/><br/>But whatever. If that's the way the modern game is played then fine. It is ultimately up to the people.
As Shakespeare should have said, ""To be or not to be Sheep, that is the question"" "

753," The Best Joker of all will knock your sox off
"," The movie JOKER, which had its world premiere at Venice 2019 and won the Golden Lion best film award on the Lido, has been mistakenly termed a ""comic book film"". True it is in a sense spinoff from the comic book based Batman film series, however, this is a serious non-comic book psychological study of how a would be stand-up comedian with a pathetic laughing syndrome goes wrong and becomes a psychotic killer. Joaquin Phoenix, 44, with his astounding interpretations of this peculiar character has now clearly established himself as the new king of Hollywood and even knocks off one of the old kings, Robert De Niro, in a short but telling sequence.
Basically this is a speculative account of how a notoriously evil public enemy, later to be known as ""The Joker"", started out as an innocent clown who loved his mother but was the victim of a ""condition"" (uncontrollable laughter) which made him a societal outcast and eventually warped his mind. His first killing which was basically in self defense when brutally attacked by three ""respectable"" men in a metro car is interpreted by the media as unmotivated murder because only we in the audience saw the brutal kicking attack. The irony is that the gun he pulled on them was given him by a fellow clown to use only in self defense. It turns out that his widowed mother has dark secrets of her own (which will peripherally connect us with the future Batman) but Phoenix as wannabe comedian ""Arthur Fleck "" (what a spotty name!) takes this role to the outer limits of the twilight zone as his frenzied laughter becomes more and more menacing. His constant disclaimer is ""I have a condition"" -- and what a condition it will turn out to be! -- culminating in his live on TV shooting of a Jay Leno type talk show host (De Niro) who, fascinated by his personality has invited Fleck to appear as a special guest. Not enough can be said of Joaquin Phoenix's bravura performance and the end result of this masterful film (Kudos to director Todd Phillips as well) is to shock you out of your pants. But a kind of shock that is exhilarating in the cinematic artistic and social sense. "
754," Ain't No Joke, It's Amazing
"," This movie is absolute perfection, I was lucky enough to see this at a festival and WOW. Phoenix's performance is incredible and so deep into the role. He truely shows how damaged the joker should be portrayed as. He will definitely be at the top for best actor. The movie is disturbing and terrifying of how the world is to people with mental health and deserves to at least be nominated best picture. "
755," As movie well overrated - acting excellent
", The depth of the story was lacking to much focus on such a short aspect of the jokers life and he became the joker there was not much of a journey. The constant musical score was over dramatic and did not add much to the film if anything it detracted from the movie. All the actors performed excellently but this is not a movie to be entertained by our top be taken in by all the characters as the focus is so much on one person without a real journey.<br/><br/>This is my opinion as my partner really thought it was a good movie. In the end I could not wait for it to be finished I think the character of joker has been devoured from the comics and previous movies.

"," This is not your typical comic book movie. No superpowers, superheroes or end-of-the world scenarios. In fact, there's not really any modern special effects. If the ""Joker"" wasn't one of a most culturally recognizable villains, this movie may not have the wide impact it's having.<br/><br/>However - he is a central character in the DC comic universe. This movie gives him a plausible, wildly dark and often sad origin story. This would not be the same movie without Phoenix's eccentric performance. He made it disturbing and believable. If he wins the Oscar for lead actor, it will be the second time someone won an Oscar for being the Joker (the other being Heath Ledger in 2009).<br/><br/>The story may hit a deep note with many people who've felt disenfranchised, alienated or ignored by society or their families. For 2 hours, I felt drawn into the world and crazed reality of the main character, Arthur Fleck (aka Joker). For that - I have to say it was a compelling watch. "

762," Well filmed but empty
"," What can I say about it that hasn't already been said? It's not a terrible film, but it's not a great (or even a really good one) either. The technical aspects are great. The score and cinematography are really good. Many individual scenes are also good. But as a whole, it just feels unnecessary. Not just that, but tone deaf as well. What it's trying to say about mental illness is problematic. Why? Because it's not really sure what it's trying to say or if it's even trying to say anything about it at all. Instead, it was added in there because, well, it's easy right? Joaquin Phoenix really does excel in many scenes of the film, but I'm not sure I would want him winning an Oscar for this. Overall, it's also just not that interesting. It's kind of... boring at times. And for a Joker film to be boring? That's a crucial offense. And I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I seriously wonder if those people calling this a ""masterpiece"" have even seen Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. "
763," THE GAME CHANGER IS HERE ! (no spoilers)

In the case of ""Taxi Driver"" there are whole lines of dialogue, characters and scenes that are lifted from it and placed in this movie. Except the execution isn't as polished, the acting not of the same caliber and the story not as original.<br/><br/>Watch ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", this film was made 40 years earlier and was made better.

765," Decent but not brilliant
"," Ok so been to see the JOKER on the back of all the reviews on here saying its a cinematic masterpiece etc etc, and while i cant argue that Phoenix certainly gives an acting masterclass the actual movie itself is dare i say it a bit slow, and a tad boring ( i dont care if you dont agree ) and as for the Joker himself he is no where near as good as the one portrayed by Heath Ledger and no where near as scary.
The Joker here comes across as a sad pitiful character who in all honesty needs a swift boot in the short and curlies followed by a good wash.<br/><br/>After i watched the Dark Knight i could not wait to see it again but certainly dont feel that way about JOKER "

", Very different from all the past interpretations of the character 
769," Technically perfect but there's something missing
"," Although this movie is competently made, it leaves me questioning the decisions they made about this character. I always thought that the Joker was interesting because of his mysterious origins and the chaos he generates. He's crazy but also very intelligent. This version of the Joker is delusional and pathetic.
The interesting aspect of the movie (for me) was the different point of view, the different perspective on Gotham's unrest and its cause. But Arthur doesn't consciously start a riot because he's fed up with the system, he just does it by accident and then, because everyone puts him on the spotlight, he just accepts his role.
But Joaquin Phoenix is great, he makes the movie worth watching. "
770," WRONG CONTEXT
"," This is a good movie. Dark, tragic and brooding. So many excellent aspects to it. Great acting, sets, costumes. Fantastic score.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>The context is that this is The Joker of Batman Nemeses notoriety. The film just doesn't fit. Arthur is a truly sad and tragic, disturbed and intellectually challenged character. His back story is deeply disturbing and one cannot help but feel sympathy if not empathy. The REAL Joker is not a sad victim. He is a malevolent, intelligent maniac. Not someone you have an ounce of sympathy for.<br/><br/>I think this movie fails because of this context. If it was purely a study into the psychological development of a sociopath I think it would be excellent. Sadly it is not. It is the origin story of a comic book baddie. Nothing comic book baddie about this miserable human.<br/><br/>There are a few other issues I had with it, there primary one being that he is incapable of coherent speech and social interaction throughout the movie but he suddenly is able to produce a powerful monologue on set in front of a live audience and in front of TV cameras and his former idol. I understand that his confidence grows the less he has to lose but I found this jarring and dissonant.<br/><br/>I also found his fantasy relationship silly and then overly ""explained"".<br/><br/>That aside, Joachim is phenomenal!! A one man tour de force. Truly believable if not relatable.<br/><br/>This is a must see for his performance but I think Batman fans will be disappointed. "
771," Great potential but to slow!

775," Badly overhyped and poorly executed by all
", This was badly overhyped on all levels. Joaquin Phoenix whom I usually enjoy did not portray the man who became the Joker very well.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME

778," It's a great movie.
"," Is whatever you want it to be. If you want to hate it, you'll hate it. If you want to love it, you'll love it. Be optimistic. "
779," Don't fall for the hype
"," I saw the joker last night and was highly disappointed. Possibly the worst joker movie I've seen. I suspect after the hype dies out it'll go down to 7 on imdb.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>I concede the movie had some interesting moments and attempted touch on mental health. I'll ignore the marxist undertone of the rich as the evil oppressors and the poor as the good oppressed and the mask wearing protagonist violent protestors who kill cops.<br/><br/>The main reason I disliked the movie was because the joker was in no way a genius super villain who could outwit other characters and the audience with his cunning intelligence. He was a sob story loser. He was in no way in control of anything that happened to him in his life and everyone got the better of him and he just took it. Even his co-workers quite easily outwitted him and caused him to be fired. He was just a sad dude. He was even bullied by a bunch of teenage kids who took his sign. What did the evil genius do? He ran after them and got the sh$@ beat out of him. Eventually when his medication ran out he started killing people and by pure luck he killed three rich men which led to his fame. Even his own fame was a complete coincidence and completely out of his control.<br/><br/>This joker will have no chance of fighting Batman. By the time Bruce is in his 30s and becomes the batman the joker will be in his 60s, at least. The only thing this pathetic joker will be fighting is PTSD and back problems. "

"," I found nothing interesting or artistic about this movie, it's just a meaningless show which pretends something meaningful "
783," This reinvention just doesent work
"," Joker didnt have any of the clever banter that we have come to know and love from one of the most well known Villians in history. The pace of this movie was totally off and basically a snooze fest for the first 40 minutes. Joaquin plays a great crazy person, but this origin story doesent give him enough leeway to truly do this movie justice. Some of the mannerisms were spot on, but the demeanor and intelligence level if the villain himself totally capsized any Hope's of enjoying this. The killings were bland and did not bring any desperately needed artistic element to the film. Towards the end, the connection made between the death of one and the rebirth of another was probably the smartest scene, and simply not worth waiting until the end to see. I left the theater in total confusion and dissappointment. "
784," Amazing
", Amazing the movie was great and they could've of done it any better Joaquin is the best actor and I enjoyed him as the joker and Todd Philips performance was really good at setting this movie out to be the best thing I have saw in a long time and I think he is the best joker in my opinion 
785," On the nose, silly and forced
"," Phoenix is great. The cinematography as well. That's it.<br/><br/>The world described in the film is not realistic, despite what they try to *tell* you. They don't show, they never show. Everything that happens is finalized to sustain Fleck's downfall. It's not organic, it feels forced. A lot of ideas, none of them explored sufficiently.<br/><br/>The movie is basically an amalgamation of Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Too many scenes that were ""inspired"" by those two great masterpieces, that deal with these matters in an actual thoughtful and mature way.
This truly is the ""we live in a society"" film.<br/><br/>I wanted to like it, I really did. I couldn't. I'm sorry? Go cry in the corner, if you're offended by my opinion. "
786," Not the Real Joker
"," It's funny to see so many 10's, this Joker is not the Batman's Joker, but someone who inspired the criminal who will become the Batman's Joker.
This movie is more a drama and a portrait of today's society than a Super Heroes (Villain) movie... so, don't expect action.
The performance is good, but not superb. I think the movie is very overrated. "

788," A MASTERPIECE
"," People were expecting this movie and this joker to be just like The Dark Knight, but how can it be when they're showing his journey from the beginning, and realistically speaking, how can a normal man with no history of violence can do what the Joker from dark knight did? I'm in love with the new storyline, and how society and some mental illnesses made him what he is, the whole movie makes so much sense. if the Joker is a real person in this world that would be the how he turned into Joker, that what makes it a 10/10, + the effects, the cinematography and how dark the violence is, and in my opinion without overhyping it, i consider it the movie of the decade.

His laugh is spot on and certainly goes beyond many others. Joaquin's overall performance is powerful and one of best in recent years. Todd Phillip's vision for a gritty non-comic based Joker film really sheds light on the problems Gotham's society. Which can easily portray a number of the problems in our actual society. Things such as lack of funding for mental health, rude and terrible people who only want to bring others down, and simply crime.

"," Dear movie freaks, Joker is the most anticipated movie that we have been expecting since the first month of year 2019 and yes this is a very good dramatic movie. I said dramatic because Joker delivers us the ideas on how Arthur Fleck character can be Joker, right when we totally forgot about Batman appearance. We don't care about Batman here. We care about a joker, a comedian, a broken child, and a really sad story of a man who sacrifices everything to be happy, yet we never really understand what is going on his mind and heart, until we saw the killings and the blood and we blame him as a villain. I really salute the Director, the make up team, editor, cinematographer, scriptwriter, and Joacquin Phoenix acting, wow he could win Oscar for this movie. This movie has few actions, but a lot of tears and drama and how we can reflect to ourselves, are we really happy or just a made-up-happy just to make our life comfortable....2 hours are not enough to understand Joker but I really love the ending that you can't watch without clapping your hands. A Masterpiece! "

"," There where certain negative critic reviews online about the movie but I found them to be completely unfair.
A random superhero movie no2: protsgonist/proragonists kill 10.000 People and no one bats an eye.
Joker: kills 5 People and everyone loses their minds.
After all, It is a movie telling the story of an 'antihero', the super villain taken from DC's universe comics and it should be viewed and reviewed as that.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a different approach on superhero movies, far from the same old recipe of their kind. It has very well-rounded screenplay(well, mostly), stunning photography and directing and the protagonist clearly manages to be a persuasive 'Joker' in his own unique way. Overall, I am hapilly surprised by this movie and enjoyed it very, very much. "

809," Finally, a movie that top The Dark Knight
"," This is the only movie that I felt giving 10/10 is justice. This movie is so original in every inch and have pushed the boundary of cinema much further. It's perfectly written, be it the script, the music score, the screenplay, the pacing, everything is very masterful. And by the end you'll be really convinced as how the Joker came to be how we know he is. This movie made the story of Batman that we know and love made so much more sense that you'll finally feel complete. I'm looking forward for the Batman movie. With Rob Pattinson cast as Batman, I'm optimistic it's a perfect role for him as how Jacquin Phoenix is the perfect one to play the Joker. Before, you'd think The Dark Knight is a dark story, and Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) is the perfect actor to play the Joker. You'll change your mind. Hats off to you Jacquin. Don't matter what the critique or interviewer say. You and everyone involved in creating this movie has shaked the cinematic world. This movie made the whole Marvel expanded cinematic universe look like they were made by amateurs. So step aside Marvel. DC is coming to reclaim the crown. "

"," Total flat storyline not a single peak moment, nothing new, nothing amazing, nothing entertaining except the acting. Just a man crying about his existence. We have seen this story a thousand times in thousand different movies also multiple times in batman too. We know that joker struggled a lot in his personal life as a common man, dull story ruined the character. I see people saying a lot good about it maybe just because they can't betray their joker but I like joker for his madness not his crying or sick attitude in his personal life. "

", Never thought anyone could perform the joker character better then heath ledger. I think the dc fans will love the movie but it wont be for everyone but i would say give it a try and decide your self dont rely only on the reviews.<br/><br/>Strong points of this film are the story background score and performances specaily the joker if your looking for all these things in a film then this is for you. 
818," Todd Phillips has matched the greatness of NOLAN
", The BEST.Absolute masterpiece. Every award ceremony should recognize this film and Pheonix You are GOD. 
819," Completely Unique!!!!!
"," An awful lot has been talked about this film even before it hit cinemas. From the triumphs at the film festivals to the backlash surrounding the subject matter of the film. There hasn't been a film in quiet like it in some time that has brought up such emotion/controversy in the public eye. Not gonna lie I was anticipating this film as soon as it was announced...........it was really fascinating to me as to why on earth Warner Bros. thought that audiences needed/wanted a Joker ""solo/origin"" film. There had to be something special about it........................my god is there something special about this film. It is truly unique not just as a comic book film but just as a film. Its more a psychological thriller than a comic book film.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is a fantastic actor no-one can take that away from him, even before witnessing his performance in this film, the man is a truly great actor anyway. Wow just wow............I didn't think it was humanly possible that anyone could embody the character of the ""Joker"" quiet like Heath Ledger did over a decade ago....but wow does Phoenix come very very close. (I know you shouldn't compare......because its not fair on either performance...........there both fantastic in there own right). Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck is pretty much your every day person at the start, however its witnessing the terrible decline in one mans journey that is truly horrifying. I'm gonna say it he deserves at least an Oscar nomination...if not more. Takes your breath away.<br/><br/>There are so many story elements to this film that just hit the nail right on the head, firstly the misdirection of Thomas Wayne being Arthur Flecks father is fantastic.....a really interesting angle however it is quickly super-seeded by the fact that Flecks mother was mentally unwell and made the whole thing up.....also whilst in the process uncovering that Fleck was adopted. His complete hallucination of Zazie Beetz character being involved with him, is done so so well, it only dawns on you at the final moment that it was a figment of his imagination........the figment being a really normal life. Mind blown!!!!!!!!!! All of which has such emotion and punch especially on Arthur........who is unwell, but that is slightly put upon him by the society that he inhabits. The culture of isolationism within Gotham City only fuels the fire raging inside Fleck waiting for the right moment to appear.......and boy it does.<br/><br/>On to the controversy surrounding the film. My own personally opinion, anyone reading this is perfectly entitled to disagree, there is no controversy with this film at all. I believe the reason for people feeling uncomfortable with this film is because it shows a true representation of what would happen to a man like this.......and more importantly that it could happen in real life today. With the society we live in today in 2019, it is plausible what happens on screen could become reality to a certain degree. Thats the part, I think, that horrifies people. Its definitely not glorifying violence, this is not a tremendously violent film...it has its moments here and there. There are plenty more violent films that have been made and are going to be made. What this film does glorify is the stigma attached to class status and mental health illnesses, however its trying to open your eyes. The film is trying to make you look in the mirror and show you that this is our society really, that Gotham City and Arthur Fleck could be replaced by anyone and anywhere if we don't look at these societal problems. Thats what I think anyway.<br/><br/>Final positive the score is out of this world. I know this sounds very snobby thing to say but the score really does inhabit an added character to the film........it is truly horrifying. Oscar nod 100%.<br/><br/>Overall this film is great....I definitely need to see it again, it needs a deserves a second viewing to really understand and appreciate everything. 85% out of 100 or 8.5 out of 10. Fantastic, real eye opening story, mind blowing performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Must also mention great directing from Todd Phillips.......the guy that did ""The Hangover"" did this.........wow. Even if your not a comic book film fan you must see this because this is least comic-booky film your ever going to see, ""King of Comedy"" meets ""Taxi Driver"". "
820," Generous 3.
"," ""Joker"" is nor a ""masterpiece"" nor is it ""flawless"" as this board boasts. It's mirely a decent origin, albeit heavy-handed as sin, with choppy flow, poor directing decisions at moments, and part brilliant part wildly overacting on Phoenix's part. The heavy handed nature of mental illness is not written well... It highlghts many different illnesses with none of which feeling whole or handled with much, if any, sense of understanding. Sprinkle in are a few light-hearted moments to remind you that ""hey, he's still funny at times""... But with the strained mental illness angle it's difficult to laugh at these moments without a bit on introspection of what it is and who it is you're laughing at. The real ""danger"" this movie poses is that it's another Hollywood blunder with mental health and its handling... Which does way more harm than good.<br/><br/>There is no great existential pandering, ss some are saying... ""it's deep"", ""my feels"", ""It's not a superhero movie it's a character study"", regardless of what anyone wants to categorize it as.. I'll consider it a generous 3. "
821," Extremely overrated
"," I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.<br/><br/>I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.<br/><br/>He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.<br/><br/>It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not. "
822," Don't Believe The Hype

I just buy ticket from PREMIUM HALL to see this movie because previously i saw a good reviews from IMDB. The previews of this movie make you want to see it, but it wasn't nearly as good as i expected it to be.

824," unbelievable, unrelatable, a bit boring to be honest
"," Joker could have been a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job, but in my opinion, the character he is playing is not believable. In a world full of extremes and evil characters (with a very tiny exception, sorry for the bad pun), the Joker's destiny and shattering past are lost in the chaotic, dark environment. His state of mind and supposed mental illness are not further explained. In a more realistic setting (like New York instead of Gotham) this might have been more convincing.<br/><br/>Sadly, this Joker is not even the same we see in the Batman movies. No Introduction to the ""why so serious"" slogan we know him for, no explanation for the scar across his face neither. Still the connection to the Waynes is elaborated very much, even though most viewers exactly know what's going to happen to them and therefore eliminates all possible tension.<br/><br/>Especially the first hour or so is pretty boring. Some people around me even fell asleep in the cinema, something I have not seen in quite some time in the movies. CGI are well done and unintrusive. I didn't notice them for most parts of the movie (which is good).<br/><br/>The Movie tries to be deep, shocking and touching, but is, for me, unrelateable, unbelievable and, yes, pretty boring. The Joker is too cartoonish to be believable, too shallow to be touching. Compared to similarly connected movies like Birdman, it falls short. "
825," Acting performance is beyond expectations
"," Joaquin Phoenix should get the Oscar 3 years in a row, for the Joker performance. Amazing physical change and adaptation for the role. Can not imagine how hard it was (for J.P) to get out of the Joker mind after the movie. "

JOKER is right up there with the greatest movies of all-time with one of the greatest performances ever by Mr. Phoenix. Anyone else wins best actor and we know the ceremonies are rigged he was THAT good! Can't wait until this comes out in 4K not only is it insta-watch in the movies but it's also insta-grab to add to the collection! BRAVO! "
840," Did all the rest of you see a different movie?
"," Joker is the main adversary of Batman. Going back to the 60s where tv where he was crazy and wicked, each version on the big screen has gone up a notch. Jack showed brillance and wicked as did Heath. Their ability to compete with a brilliant Batman was not just based on being the evil Batman, but his equal in brain power.<br/><br/>Not so with this pychopath, who was been damaged so bad he shows no intelligence. Just pure evil. And that is not what the Joker is. This Joker is an embarressment and when you walk out of the movie you will know this is not the Joker, this is Michael Myers in clown face.<br/><br/>Some of the plot is well thought out, making the rich the true evil and blaiming everything on Thomas Wayne, and Mom Fleck, and bullies and everyone else. And Joker ""coming out"" by killing 3 sleezeball ""stock trader"" types that brought all of this on themselves. The first 2 deserved it and it would have been self defence, but then he hunted down and shot the third in the back as he was trying to get away. From there it was just a horror movie with clownface. Then the upset mobs, tired of their lot in life make him their hero. Kinda like OJ and Trump.<br/><br/>No it's not political Joker says, but yes it is. It is preachy and a terrible movie. "
841," I made an account just to rate my disappoint for this film.
"," I was expecting a masterpiece and oscar worthy film from all the hype.
I actually didn't enjoy watching this movie.
there was no message, it was slow and the joker turned out just to be the son of a schizophrenic and went crazy over a slight amount of bullying. I don't see how anyone could relate to this character and the laughing is lame acting way overdone.
I'm just stunned that this has a 9/10 rating right now, how the hell? "
842," Overacting Galore
"," I was underwhelmed - to say it friendly - but not surprised by the fact. Because Hollywood has lost its magic looong time ago. IMHO no. bo. dy gives a damn about Darth Vader's Childhood or Joker's relationship with his mother. All we want for centuries is a proper boogeyman. If you overpaid LaLaLand-Schmocks won't jump from the stupid Prequel-explains-it-all-train - please give us at least solid filmmaking. Joker is a mess. No story, no finesse, no build-up, no surprises, no ideas. But a load of layman-psychology that should make even 12y olds roll their eyes; a cacophony of more or less unrelated scenes; cheesy taxi-driver-moments without any impact; massive overacting by Phoenix and no subtle sinister Joker moments except for the two second Elevator-Scene we all know (and love) from the trailer. rating 9.0? A joke. Heath Ledger, I miss you. "

844," You Complete The Mission! Nominee For Oscar! And Heath Ledger Is Proud Of You!

845," 'You don't really understand an antagonist until you understand why he's a protagonist in his own version of the world'
"," Such a sad movie with a consuming psychological depth. a dark portrayal of a character with an iconic and sorrowful laugh, who slowly collapses under the pressuring circumstances. great soundtracks and beautiful acting.
it seems to be an everyday tragic but it still touches you in a new and different way of raw &amp; haunting reality. the best part: another interpretation of the joker. his disoriented and ""unintentionally"" actions are full of desperation, (always had a weak spot whenever I saw people hurting inside, and he definitely hit that). it really feels like the beginning of all - of how arthur becomes the joker. "

850," Still processing the movie (it's very good)
", Watched Joker in the cinema a couple of hours ago and am still processing it. It's not the movie you expect but rather way better than you would expect. You won't feel happy watching this movie as the story is about a struggling man. The acting and bizarre movement of Arthur is just perfect. This is a must watch as it will most likely make you feel the need to process what you just experienced. 
851," Although everyone's entitled....
"," Although everyone's entitled to their own opinion and that's totally understandable and everything but to the people who are bashing this masterpiece by saying it is showing ""irresponsible violence"", it ""mocks mental illness"" and all that, I'll just say read or know about comics first and then watch this movie, go home, think, and watch it again just to appreciate the sheer brilliance that this movie portrays in terms of acting, direction, cinematography, the background score and what not!
I'm not saying that everyone has to read comics before watching this movie I'm just suggesting that before bashing this piece of art, know about the character, it's story arc what it stands for, it's history and all that. If the issue still pertains? Maybe it is wrong but give it a try. "

But if it is rewarded with more than that, I'd be surprised. "
860," Sorry Heath, you've been bumped.
"," I dislike the DC universe, to be frank. Justice League, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Superman are boring let downs. Chris Nolan's vision of Batman was certainly decent. Heath Ledger's Joker was compelling and certainly a worthy performance. Joaquin Phoenix has redefined this character in a way that will not be touched by anyone for a long time. This movie is a character study beyond words. I loved it. It's just amazing.<br/><br/>I am hopeful that this blueprint will pave the way for more sophisticated adaptations for superhero/antihero movies. It was, at times, heartwrenching and other times downright tense to experience. To the detractors that say that this movie will produce violence....grow up. This is a movie about a VILLAIN. If you didn't assume that violence was a part of the formula, then you are not firing on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Oscar's better be in the forecast. "

And last but not least Todd Phillips' directing which had a lot of frames that is art gallery worthy.

Soundtracks was amazing, also the cinematography and the direction.
All of things in this movie were perfect. "
884," It's insane
"," The positive reviews clearly got the movie, the negative ones are stuck in the past. This movie is difficult to watch. It's a savage depiction of humanity. Must watch! "
885," Ok Esquire Obviously didnt have mental capacity to understand the meaning of the film or society at times.
"," This movie is the first thing dc has done right since Wonder Woman and Kind of Aquaman which might survive on their own story arcs, but they outdid bvs and justice league so much they were left with a tough decision, splitem or quitem, and im still inerested to see what they do. But this movie has alot to do with the abandonment for ""what one thinks is ones own good"", and how many people that live not such enriched lives feel towards those who take it for granted. Anyway to not keep this joker story arc at least involved in the new films may be a mistake. They can literally do anything they want with it. This is the original Joker, was not one before him in this movie, this guy could seemingly cause enough problems without any outside contact, but surely his escape will be inevitable. Only reason i gave nine stars is why a paternity test was never done to prove it, telling me theres a good chance he is his father and just or was a complete hypocrite that refused to confront his past. "
886," Staying power
"," One of the things I found most memorable was the transformation of Joaquin Phoenix---the story isn't about a comic book villain, but a real person with a serious illness. All during the movie we see how life is for him--a horror of humiliation and fear. He trudges thru life (to get to his seedy apartment, he has to climb steep cement stairs. ) In his transformation into 'Joker', we can feel his sense of triumph as he descends those same stairs---Joaquin is unrecognizable in this new identity. This movie has hit some kind of nerve. So far, no violent imitators, just big numbers at the box office. In NYC, those stairs have become a tourist attraction. "
887," What I Expected & More Done Very Well
"," There have been so many Joker actors over the years that I expected this one to be a fractured world of a disfunctional life. What I did not expect is the great script and Phoenix to raise the Joker to a whole new level. When you take this story as a whole you can see and feel why the Joker is who he is. The depth this film establishes is beyond what I expected.<br/><br/>I found some of the reason this works so well is the script writers both have some pretty good films under their belt, in particular The Hangover and that's the perfect writing style to design a Joker script. The Director here directed Hangover too which does not hurt. They really wrote a great script.<br/><br/>It is the actors who make it work. Besides Phoenix, Robert De Niro to me was a major surprise in support. When I first saw that he was doing a Carson type talk show type rip-off, I thought boring, I've seen it done before. Then, as the film moved on, suddenly De Niro brought a special something to the role. I'd say a Best Supporting Actor is possible for the actor here.<br/><br/>Zazie Beetz stuck out to me too, as Joker's well, I am not sure you can classify it as girlfriend but then again you can. To me she not only played her role well, she also had a really strong attraction here which I can not quantitify. Her script is kind of limited and the background of her character is not completed, but her skills are really shown off. Frances Conroy's mom's character is solid too. Brett Cullen for some reason reminds me of Alec Baldwin in looks, and he is fine here though not much script.<br/><br/>The story creates a strong sympathy for Joker, and then shows the horrifying results in a way that has not been done before. There is also this strange thing between Joker's character and young boys that is a tension presented throughout this movie. Joker's character has tension, and an ironic comment on Government which enables him to string out of drugs while receiving supposed sponsored theraphy, then pulls the rug out from under him with budget cuts. I give the movie credit though, as it is not presented that the budget cuts actually caused Joker's problems. He is much more conflicted than that. His involvement with the Wayne family is quite unique. Does mom really know best is the question you have to ask yourself? I never thought that maybe the Joker might need to go on (spoiler) Maury for a DNA test?<br/><br/>There is little to critic in this one other than timeline, as it's not real clear in parts where the date really is. Then again, this movie proves we don't really need to know what time it is to present a well-told story. Most everything fits, as a life fractured in a fractured city is what this is.<br/><br/>We do know how it fits with other films of the saga. It is one of the strongest DC based films in a long while. Timeline was a theme in Hangover, but this drama goes way beyond just a hangover. "
888," Over the top - and then some
"," This movie reminded me of Kubrick's version of Stephen King's THE SHINING. It has the same sense of darkness enveloping the characters. But, like Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), Arthur Fleck is manic - a maniac, really - from the start. The violence escalates (and how - I can't believe this movie got away with a 15 rating), but there's no real explanation of what made Arthur the way he is. Thanks to all the other movies in the Batman franchise, we know where the Joker is headed, but we need an 'origins' prequel to this one.<br/><br/>Robert de Niro, playing a talk-show host, brings a reminder of dark roles he has vividly brought to life. But Joaquin Phoenix's performance, like Heath Ledger's in 2008, is a tour-de-force: over the top, and then some.<br/><br/>A deeply disturbing movie. And worryingly likely to be seen as celebrating violence. "
889," This is a movie you either love or hate, my opinion being the former
"," I can get why some people don't like this movie, as it is quite unsettling to watch, but that in my opinion is what makes it great. It pulls you in and makes you feel things, even if those things aren't exactly what you're used to "
890," This is a must see
"," Im not a Batman fan, actually I didn't even see The Dark Knight.
I just went to see this movie because my wife wanted to go out...
But after a couple of minutes I was totally in, glued to the chair and eating that masterpiece with all my senses. Acting, PHOTOS, music just WOW!
Unbelievable climate, colors ... Just go to the cinema, you don't want to see that at home. "
891," No joke - it's brilliant
"," I'll leave all the glossy remarks to the paid critics.<br/><br/>I simply want to say that seldom have I been so riveted by a performance as I was last night.<br/><br/>I'm primarily a comic Fan, long term too. Most adaptions are less than rubbish. This is excellent. Phoenix is Oscar worthy and the production is terrific.<br/><br/>Being set in the past removes the over abundance of tech and gadgets which suits the character and the myth. It also allows the actors and the words to shine.<br/><br/>The photography, the music (wow) and the supporting cast was flawless.<br/><br/>So pleased it's still possible to make a movie like this. "
892," Emotionally Stimulating
"," There is such a menagerie of emotions in this film. You feel bad for the Joker, yet disgusted by his actions. Jacquin is incredible bringing the weirdness of his akward character to life. His moves, his words, his emotions and his thoughts are all absorbed watching his on screen. This is award winning acting and writing. "
893," Was not disappointed
"," When I first saw the set photos I was really excited, but I didn't have a lot of faith in the project. When I watched the movie, I was blown away especially with the symbolic scenes towards the end. "
894," Fantastically produced art
"," The uniqueness of this movie can't be underlined enough. As you can definitely relate it the likes of Taxi Driver, this film stands alone in its production, direction, photography, score etc. Albeit, it can be disturbing to some at times, it sheds light on very common issues in today's society including corruption, mental illness, etc. It took me days to conjure an opinion on this movie after seeing it, making it even more unique to myself. My final opinion being it's a remarkable piece of art. "
895," The ""New"" Joker
"," PART 1: Laughing - ""put on a happy face""
Arthur Fleck dreams of being a stand-alone comedian, whose best quality is probably filial piety (he has been taking care of his sick mother for years). He was affectionately referred to by his mother as ""Happy"" in the hope that he would always be smiling, always happy, and he also wished he could bring smiles to everyone. Ironically, going back in the past, perhaps his violent days affected his smile. He suffers from an uncontrollable illness, and when he does, he laughs and annoys people. The dramatic scene of his smile lies in the segment when he watches a comedy. People laugh, then he did not and vice versa. Or his gentle smile to her neighbor Sophie Dumond.
PART 2: A bad comedian
Arthur extremely admired Murray Franklin - he is a comedy host, has a strong influence on Arthur. He has the ability to turn Gotham's horrible problems into laughter (which is a kind of optimism) - but people like him, like Arthur, say ""have never stepped out of the stage"" to see life. out there like. He has absolutely no empathy for people in lower statuses like Arthur in particular and the Gotham people in general. He made Arthur laughed and Arthur now gave him an ending that he ""deserved"".
PART 3: Call me Joker
Before going on stage, Arthur had a little request with Murray, introduce him as: Joker. And a Arthur ""nothing to lose"" was completely different. Arthur - The Joker shows a confident dance as he prepares to go on stage and what Joker does, simply confess on Gotham TV. We have a truly internal Joker, no plan, no destructive things but the way the Joker works is really cold, not too gimmicky (this is for the soldier to do) and keep the item main destination.
PART 4: The end
My impression of the Joker is the perfect performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Is extremely reasonable music, as if going to teach you to know where to use teaching aids. A perfect scenario for the downhill, human frustration of Arthur. And contrary to many people, I was most impressed by the Jokers' dances, when I was happy with his mother, with childrens, when he was confident going to the studio and barbarians at the end of the film. And how barbarians enjoy yourselves. "
896," World class acting. A must see.
"," I waited to see this post the initial first weekend hype but this film really did live up to it. It's a 9/10 for the film overall. The dark subject matter won't make any 'feel good' lists however Phoenix's title role is quite simply one of the greatest acting performances of all time. It's also a perfect origin story. Well thought through and brings a real sense of mania to the viewer. Moreover, this is just the beginning for this character and interesting to see how studio bosses will react to its undoubted incoming success. Go see. "
897," Its a different take, brilliantly presented.
"," First review but I simply felt I needed to share. Some people will not like it because this is a movie that certainly doesn't fit in todays style. I believe if you were to put the movie into a time it would well fit around the time Alien was produced. It is slow paced and portraits a real development of a character - unlike nowadays blockbusters that have nearly no character development.<br/><br/>Personally I find it hard to compare Joker to 'The Dark Knight' . First of all due to the nature of them being different Jokers / different backgrounds, secondly even if they were the same, The Dark Knight is a way later and more developed Joker. I would love to see a sequel to this take but I am not sure if we will get one. Personally I enjoy Ledger's performance a bit more but thats personal preference, both actors did an outstanding job and in my opinion this is at least an Oscar nomination for Phoenix.<br/><br/>Overall if you go into the movie, do not expect an action filled thriller but a portrait of a troubled man giving into madness. 9.5/10 for me. "
898," 10/10..A+++++...BRILLIANT...OSCAR WORTHY,FILM AND JOAQUIN
", Best movie i have seen for a long long time..Do yourself a favour and go see it. Very few movies get me thinking of it days after but this certainly did...Masterpiece! Did i say i enjoyed it?? 
899," Gripping! Terrifying!
"," ""Joker"" is gripping because it follows you around long after you've seen it, and Joaquin's character transformations control your attention. The film is also terrifying because it is a metaphor for today's unrest in society: the US vs. THEM mentality and where it can lead. A true work of cinematic art. "

902," Near perfect film
"," The pacing of this film is perfect, doesn't miss a beat. No dead time, Phoenix is simply incredible. Who would have have thought this is the same guy that made the hangover and old school. (love old school BTW)
The only possible criticism I have is in the cinematography, missing the mark on one or two scenes. Specifically walking down the steps (not too spoiler)
I would have also liked the batman references to be a bit less obvious, but that's just me!
Left the cinema in elation, soooo good. "

905," Amazing Character study
"," Just watched this in Bangkok , and looking around after the movie I think most people were expecting something completely different to what was on the screen.
I myself thought this was an amazing attempt at telling a familiar story without any big budget special effects or Marvelized story telling ( and trust me I absolutely love Marvel movies )
What I saw was possibly one of the best acting performances of my generation, and being just shy of 40 , I believe it's what people would have seen in Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro !!!
Don't expect a superhero movie , expect quite possibly one of the best psychological thrillers you will ever see , then you won't be disappointed. "
906," Phoenix is absolutely amazing in this film. Heath would be proud!
"," I only recently learned that this film was enthralled in some ""controversy"" and felt the need to write a review to support this art. Saw the film in Toronto and I absolutely loved it. I would ignore the perpetually offended outrage mob and recomend this movie to all my friends. I had some slight pacing issues, but overall this is an A+ movie. Will be taking my wife to see it when it's released in my hometown! "
907," MOVIE OF THE DECADE
"," This film is not for everyone, certainly. After seeing it in the theaters, I had to actually think a few days whether I liked it or not. The answer was no, I did not like it, I LOVED it. What a performance by the one and only, Joaquin Phoenix! He HAS to get an Oscar for this, without a doubt. If not now, then when? "
908," Wow!!
"," I went mostly because other family members wanted to go, and I was blown away. If he doesn't win every best actor award something is wrong. I couldn't believe how great this movie was and watching him devolve into madness was so compelling and grotesquely beautiful. A must see! "
909," Outstanding performance!!!!!! 10/10
", Before watching the Joker I heard a lot of bad about it that it's gonna be politically bad and stuff like that but I knew different I knew that this is going to be an art. And I wasn't wrong. The delivered performance by Phoenix and his deep connection with Arthur is something a true movie fan should watch and reflect on. A true Oscar contender. 
910," Amazing movie
"," The movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end. "
911," Joke is a Masterpiece of Film Making! (Long)
"," The performance of Joaquin Phoenix in this movie is from beginning to end outstanding and in my opinion rivals that of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight which is one of my favorite movies of all time! Phoenix's performance done to every detail perfectly portrays the character he was supposed to be and makes it 100% believable. This performance in the lead role is truly an artist at the top of his game, and any better performance is hard to find. Phoenix makes you feel sympathy and understanding for a character that previously was usually regarded as just a crazy and interesting Batman villain. This Joker truly went through Hell to become the character, and it shows how mental illness and it's relation to society really impacts people just maybe not to this extent. The characters descent into madness is extremely hard to watch in a way because you wish you could do something to help, maybe you even feel to some extent it isn't his fault. Then at the end the man that you saw progress through the film becomes who you knew he was going to become anyway, but somehow through the whole thing it almost feels like a surprise nevertheless because you don't feel like he is really a bad guy. This is all just about the main character and the lead actors stellar performance. The rest of the movie is outstanding too, as the casting, music, and every choice made for this film feels like exactly what it should be. Robert De Niro is another shining star in this movie in my opinion and is a very interestinG and important character. Regarding music my favorite scene in the film is when Arthur is dancing on the stairs that he previously trudged over and it makes you feel like this is when he truly becomes the Joker and is free in a sense. In terms of music it is all set to Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter which was a perfect choice despite the controversy of using the song. The scene at the end on the Murray Franklin show is also outstanding as although you know Arthur has committed heinous crimes his monologue makes some sense and it doesn't feel like entirely his fault, and it is all capped off with a killer knock knock joke (pun intended) as instead of shooting himself like he planned he kills Murray Franklin. This is where the character of Joker is truly his own person as now there is now going back. Despite it being kind of cheap to reference Batman the way the Wayne's are tied in is very intriguing. Thomas and Martha Wayne end up being killed by a clown protester because of the movement establishing the Wayne's as some of their most hated figures, and it makes it seem like Joker and Batman were
Always meant to be archenemies. Unfortunately yet fortunately the end of this film when Arthur is in Arkham makes what happened in this movie less black and white and more gray. It seems to show that Arthur had imagined the happenings of the movie to some extent because Arkham looks entirely different from what we saw during the course of the film and Arthur has been shown to imagine things to an extreme degree. This however is perfectly appropriate for the Joker as he once said if he must have a backstory he prefers it to be multiple choice. This film from start to end is fantastic and is a must see. Every detail of the film is perfect. Now to the counter arguments as some of the people I know have seen this film didn't not enjoy it at all and have presented arguments I will address. The first criticism is that the movie is slow moving and boring. Addressing the first part of that the movie may seem slow because it is about a mans descent into madness and how his mental illness and treatment by society contributed to it or even caused it. This process is not a quick one, and even in the movie it all unfolds in a relatively short period of time. The movie is ""boring"" part of this argument can be attributed to a few things. Either the person saying this is a psychopath, they have watched too many marvel and more campy superhero movies, or they just don't understand the film. This film contains stellar acting, great music, an interesting an engaging plot that is related to the real world, and some extremely violent and graphic things. If this movie is ""boring"" to you not only did you come in with the wrong expectations, but you are looking at the movie in the wrong way. The final argument I heard against this film is that it isn't ""fun"" and the ridiculousness of this statement is truly indescribable. This movie is not intended to be a fun, campy superhero story similar to the marvel films or something else which I like too may I say. This movie addresses real life issues of our society and is not meant to be taken lightly. This movie is rated r for a reason it is some heavy stuff. This film is gritty, realistic, and serious just how it should be, and if you don't like that than leave the rest of us moviegoers to appreciate the true masterpiece this film is. Besides that I truly think this film is fun to watch just in a different way. This film is fun to watch because it is extremely well made and in my opinion is perfect in every detail and decision. Not all movies are fun to watch because they are funny, not serious, and not violent. All a movie needs to be fun is to be well made and Joker certainly is that. This film is legitimately one of my favorite movies of all time, and Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker rivals that of Heath Ledger's! This movie is a must see and should absolutely win some oscars, but if it doesn't that just proves how much of a joke they are. Just do me and yourself a favor don't go to the Joker movie and expect to have fun, and laugh along to a campy and funny superhero movie. Those kinds of films have their time and place and are enjoyable but this film should not be that way at all and you shouldn't expect it to be. This movie is a new take on the Joker character with the ideas of serious issues regarding mental health and society being the main theme of it. This movie is violent, realistic, creepy and maybe even terrifying. This is not a marvel movie; this is not the 60s Batman TV show and it is like nothing you have seen before, but if you listen to what I said and come in with the right expectations than this movie can be regarded as one of the best films ever made especially a comic book film. "
912," Laughing hard at the haters
"," 'Joker' is a brilliantly crafted film that tugs at the heart strings at Arthur Fleck's misfortune.
The score, cinematography, production design, Joaquin Phoenix and the meaning is all brilliant.
I can't help but follow and understand Arthur through this haunted journey.
The most powerful moment has to be the blood smile. Symbolising the death of Arthur and rise of the Joker. The score as it's happening is just so riveting.
His laugh has more meaning than ever, a fantastic new take on the Joker's laugh, where it's seen as a mentally ill thing.
I love Joker because of how different it is compared to the majority of Comic Book Movies.
Dark, not much humour (I don't really humour mind being in CBM)
It's just so different from Marvel because of how repetitive they are.
Todd Phillips, thank you for bringing my favourite character back to life again.

917," JOKER - Anatomy of Psycho-Dramatic Rise of ""Phoenix""
"," A lanky Caucasian man, sitting in front of a make-up table painting his face white. Through his pondering eyes rolls a tear, smudging his mascara, while he pulls his mouth wide as if forcing a smile. Meet Arthur Fleck, a 30-something impoverished party-clown who's still mentally recuperating after years in the asylum.<br/><br/>With a neurological disorder of uncontrollable laughter citing his traumatic childhood, Fleck struggles every day to make ends meet with futile attempts to tackle bullying in public and taking care of a delusional mother at home. Set in the 80's Gotham, where a worker's strike lead to city-wide garbage congestion and thus, rise in the anti-establishment views at large. Both of the above circumstances foreshadow the inevitable.
And then, a cataclysmic event by a desperate act of self-defence pushes our helpless clown over the edge. We see Fleck in makeup breaking into a slow-ballet and sashay to his music, wrapped in a calming trance of his own inner turmoil. We know it then, for sure, that our villain has arrived.<br/><br/>Having said so, JOKER doesn't overcook the rhymes and reasons but is a textbook on the anatomy of a psychopath. It is well-structured, moderately paced with a compelling character-origin story. Director Todd Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher (""The Hangover"", ""War Dogs"") create an enigma of sorts amidst tight close-ups over the ominous grave themes in cello by upcoming composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir (""Chernobyl"") - all in a harmony. They make Fleck's circumstantial actions seem so justified that it's hard not to feel for him - even when he does things because he can.<br/><br/>Been spoken about those influential comparisons with prior inspirations, such as - ""The Man Who Laughs"" (a 1928 Victor Hugo novel's adaptation), or ""King of Comedy"" (Martin Scorsese's 1983 dark-comedy, also starring De Niro, who plays a pivotal role here); the one with Jack Nicholson (1989) or, the most remembered ""THE Heath Ledger's portrayal"" (Christopher Nolan's 2008 ""The Dark Knight"") - all seem justified. However, just like the latter did for 'Batman', this film does for the psychotic super-villain - viz. ""to make it incredibly more human"".<br/><br/>And, who else could have done it better than Joaquin Phoenix? Much like some previous performances - ""Walk the Line"", ""Her"" - his portrayal is rhythmically alarming, comical, self-driven and empathetic that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call it among the finest screen-acting in the last few decades. Embodying Arthur Fleck and his personality's grim deterioration are imploring enough to search for something personal in those exhausting cackles, painful failures and delusions of grandeur, humiliations, the agony of being overlooked and stepped-over. Hence, it feels triumphant when the retaliation comes through a cacophony of riots as the Joker rises with a wide smile, unforced and natural this time.<br/><br/>So, until we have reservations with the portrayal of mental illness and violence on-screen, please don't miss this rare gem of a psychological-drama. We may have the last laugh with this one.<br/><br/>Hypnotic and near brilliant!

919," Really 9 1/2 stars
"," It's really that good, near perfect film. It wonderfully explores the complexities of mental illness &amp; society's obligation to the individual in terms of care. Then delves into the socioeconomic divide in America &amp; how it impacts lives. This movie has an R rating so I don't get the backlash against the violence. American history is filled with violence &amp; movies from the seventies were way more violent &amp; filled with more harsh adult themes than this film. Joaquin Phoenix does a riveting job of portraying a believable character, who is as much a product of society as society is of his world due to the harm he inflicts. A classic example of art imitating life. The director, Todd Phillips, brings grit to the camera as well as a marvelous score that is ominous as well as sets the metamorphosis of Joker. Definitely one of the best ""comic book "" films of all time. So much closer to the ""Killing Joke"" graphic novel than the animated movie. "
920," An Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix
",
921," A must see
"," I was not a massive DC fan, but this film might have just made me! Joaquin Phoenix gives an outstanding performance, his execution of Arthur Fleck chilled me to the bone. It's not often a character makes me uncomfortable, but the Joker did - it was incredible. It is not really a story so much with a beginning, middle and end, but more of an unsettling and deep character study. I speak for the whole theatre when I say it was shocking and surprising as well. (The woman next to me kept jumping out of her seat!) The character of Arthur Fleck is absolutely captivating and so so intriguing. He is fascinating to watch. The whole film has an off beat and uncomfortable tone, and Arthur's thoughts, feelings and pain is tangible and palpable. Joker delves into the characters mind like no other film. "

923," Well-done portrait of the Joker, from inside to outside.
"," This was an intriguing examination of mental disorder and its causes. I believe that the movie was distinct with its direction of the storytelling from the get go, and I am glad that the film managed to handle the complex ambience. The character development of the Joker was well-choreographed by the phenomenal performance from Joaquin Phoenix, which was also accompanied by Todd Philips' balanced production.<br/><br/>However, there were some plot points that felt like it was not fitting the film. Especially the storyline that connects Arthur and the Wayne family did not work out. The concept of relating the origin of both character is not really new (considering Tim burton's 1989 batman) and it was not even laid out properly in the film. I think the movie took full advantage of the fact that the character joker represents a dubious background, which at some point raises questions toward the causality that surrounds Arthur. The whole effort to tie this film with batman universe felt unnecessary, and to some degree it disturbed the identity of the film.<br/><br/>Social commentaries were made regarding the movie; the film was said to be dangerous for its alleged romanticization of the violence that roots from the suppressed individuals. I disagree. The film did not glorify the route Arthur takes. Rather, the story was a depiction of the event that would likely to happen in a similar kinds of situation. The disturbance comes from its rawness, and the awareness originates from the disturbance. I admire Todd for not shying away from presenting every aspect of a human who has reached the rock bottom. That way this film portraits not only the joker inside of the movie screen, but also the ""jokers"" outside of the movie screen.<br/><br/>Overall the theme were nicely put, was projected in a form of Joaquin's exceptional acting, but the storyline had some unnecessary weight on it.<br/><br/>+Numerous symbolisms in the movie were extremely vivid, but the one that impressed me the most was the hospital scene in general. As Arthur dances in the hospital room filled with children, the movie accompanies the scene with a nursery rhyme ""If you're happy and you know it."" The lyric sings to stomp the feet if you are happy as Arthur stomps his feet vigorously (the movie emphasizes the movement quite a lot). Because of his excessive moves he accidentally drops a gun, which later becomes the very first event that triggers Arthur's development as a joker. The action of him trying to show the audience that he is happy results Arthur to reveal his gun, which I think is a metaphor of his vile instinct inside him. This interpretation could be along the line of over-analyzation, but to me at least it was an interesting component. "
924," Amazing!
"," The beginning of this movie is quite slow, so one star fell for that. The plot is pleasantly easy to follow probably because of really goddamn great editing. Casting could not be chosen better, but Joaquin Phoenix was a spot on choice for the main role, and just amazing job he did channeling all the feelings, mental illness and tiredness of Joker to the audience - all of it mostly just by the gaze in his eyes. Soundtracks are very _very_ well chosen to fit a scene. Not too much action, but all the action scenes are sudden, surprising and gory enough to make one cringe. Must say that this movie is one of my personal favorites. "

Joachim Phoenix will win the best actor at the Golden Globes, the Oscars and any other award show on the planet. I did not want to give this film a 10 out of 10 stars only because it was TOO REAL! Phoenix was in pretty much every frame and it will go down as his masterpiece. If no one ever saw Joker the world may actually be a better, safer place. "

", This is by far one of the best films I've seen for a long long time . Went and watched it tonight and its unbelievable. Its brilliant and hats off to mr Phoenix bravo that's acting at the top brilliant . Don't listen to reviews from this one and that don't listen to the clowns on twitter .

"," The film is different from anything I've seen before. Normally the villain is part of a hero story - but here everything revolves around the icon of all movie villains. Without giving anything away, this is a must-see movie. But beware, it's the kind of movie where you end up sitting in the seat speechless and thinking: ""What?!??"".<br/><br/>Joaquin is great and definitely deserves an Oscar for this outstanding role he plays! "
932," Dark, Gritty and Absolutely Breathtaking
"," First of all, this has to be performance that could finally land Joaquin Phoenix his long overdue Oscar. He handled the characterizaton almost flawlessly. Fans of Heath Ledger's Joker would surely be proud at Phoenix's performance.<br/><br/>The plot is gripping and does not for once drag with time. The supporting cast is brilliant as well while the direction and cinematography are top notch. It's a movie that I wouldn't mind watching again because I know it will still blow me away. Don't miss this! "
933," Joker Begins
",
934," Why so serious?
"," ""Joker"" is highly derivative and a poor imitation of better Scorsese movies. The movie didn't really know what it was trying to say. On top of that it's very cynical and will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. Great performance from Joaquin Phoenix but it's not essential viewing. "
935," Interesting Origin Movie on the Joker
"," Joaquin Phoenix' performance: A<br/><br/>Rest of the movie as a whole: D<br/><br/>Total: C<br/><br/>Some will love it, some will hate it. I'm somewhere in the middle. "
936," Hype for no reason
"," I made an imdb account after watching this movie. It was that terrible. Watching Joaquin Phoenix do interperative dance and try really hard to play an effeminate mentally ill person. The change into the Joker never felt earned. The movie itself was predictable and forced. A try hard edgelord masterpiece. Surprised he wasn't wearing a fedora. This movie just doesn't get the joke, because it IS the joke. "
937," What the hell
"," I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is complete crap. I really don't understand the hype over it. I was watching it and just couldn't watch it till the end.. it was so boring. I made myself go and watch it again till the end, but again there was no way for me to do that. It was extremely boring, made no sense, zero connection to Joker. When I saw people writing that Joaquin is better joker than Heath Ledger I just needed to see that. But now I'm asking myself are these people freaking normal, you just can't put these two names in the same sentence. Joaquin's joker can't and never will be better because it even isn't a joker, it is a disaster. "
938," Unpopular opinion: Terrible movie
"," Just watched the movie, and I had to make an account just to put it out there, after hearing tons and tons of praises, that this movie has failed terribly in living up to the hype! I know that my opinion is extremely unpopular, but someone needs to say it. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as the joker, in regards to his acting, but that is probably the only positive thing about this movie. And I believe that a movie needs much more than just good acting. This movie does not even have a proper climate, and is basically about a mental illness, where I feel there is no hint of the charismatic, sick and brilliant joker we got to see in the batman series! "
939," Not bad
", Overrated it's normal not bad and not very good either 
940," Don't buy into the hype!
"," I wonder why DC licensed the brand to Todd n Co. The character (Arthur Fleck) never creates any chaos by himself, no manipulation n threat stuff, no explosions, no gunpowders. In short, there's very little this Joker does other than just borrowing the costume and signature laugh from the iconic character. Of course one could argue that it's a character in it's early stages before transforming into the supervillain. But then what's the fun in watching just another psychopath movie with a troubled psychotic patient getting bullied and disregarded by society. Honestly, I've seen a ton of movies with a similar plot. To make matter worse, the character doesn't even turn a villain at the end of the movie. JOKER is a mediocre attempt psychotic thriller movie which doesn't do justice to the title. The movie could've worked better as an independent film without the unnecessary portrayal of the legendary character. "
941," Perfect! No... BRILLIANT!!!!
", It was the best time-spending this year!! I've felt total atmosphere of actions and I'm so happy! You must check it out !!! 
942," Believe the hype!
"," I was hesitant when I was going to see this because the IMDB score was so high that I honestly figured people (comic and Batman fans, DC fans, Joker fans etc..) were just rating it a 10 without seeing it. I can't remember the last time a movie has exceeded my expectations this much. In my personal opinion, this is now the best portrayal of the Joker in history....just barely edging out Heath. I honestly think Heath would be super proud!<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into any details, because you should most definitely experience this movie first hand...the acting, cinematography, production, writing/dialogue and story are all TOP NOTCH and it is most definitely Oscar worthy....In fact, i have a feeling this movie is going to sweep the Oscar's...it is THAT good!<br/><br/>I suggest seeing it while it is still playing in theaters, because the movie-going experience of seeing this on the big screen is second to none! "
943," Dark, serious, tense... and bad!
"," Somehow the darkest and most serious movies get the highest ratings. People say that this movie is so thrilling and that Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar but at the end of the day, it wasn't entertainment. There were so many evil moments and dark scenes but what's so good about that?<br/><br/>This movie was almost like instructions on how to be a psycho. They flipped the usual idea and boundaries of good and evil for the audience to feel sorry for the bad guy. People seem to think this is a good thing. It's bad!<br/><br/>The point of a movie is to entertain audiences and this movie just made me feel depressed and miserable. I'll have to watch a movie where the hero is clear and the villain is clear so I can actually be entertained. The fundemental and successful formula for a film. "
944," Overhyped
", I sat through this slowwwwww movie and would gladly have left half way into it. Its a boring movie until the last 5 minutes... overhyped as usual....the violence must have been cut out of the version i seen as i think i have seen more gore in a disney movie 
945," Master joke
"," That's what this movie is. Forget about all those shills with 'masterpiece' in their reviews, this movie is baaaaad. It has nothing to do with DC or the superhero/supervillain genre. A poor man's Taxi Driver in clown make-up. And 2 hours of closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's face. The joke is on the people who continue to plop down money to see this joke. "

"," This is a very different movie from Endgame, so stop the comparisons. If you must compare it to something, compare it to other movies with Joker in it. Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, that's all fine and good. But do not compare it to something that is a different context. If you must compare to a Marvel product, then how bout Logan...if you must. That's even a stretch. Comparing it to the other just shows how biased you are towards DC and or Marvel. Just give your observation and leave it at that. No comparison needed. It should be able to stand or fall on it's own merit alone. "
956," The best of the best
"," I just saw this movie about a day ago, and it completely blew me away, namely the main character, protagonist, hero? Joker. we love, hate, and or just plain utterly confused about how we feel of Joker. Joker is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you.

959," A 'Triumph of the Will' for Nihilists
"," 'Joker' is a sick, disgusting, dark, evil, violent, total piece of scheisse. It will seriously affect emotionally troubled young people already pulled at by suicide, addictive behaviors, and hopelessness. It's like a 'Triumph of the Will' for nihilists. I would defer from voting for Joaquin Phoenix for best actor until i see video of his normal non-acting self...it may be he wasn't acting in 'Joker' at all and is one majorly screwed up dude. And, what a weird alien body. He's naked from the waist up a lot in 'Joker' and, from the waist up, is, let's say, disquieting. All taut skin stretched tightly over an alien bone structure. The bones stick up and out at odd angles, in odd places, like the exoskeleton of a medical experiment gone wrong. Not a single pleasant moment in the movie. Not a moment of joy, nor beauty, nor happiness. No catharsis from all the misery and violence, just a stomach churning emptiness at the thought that the last fifty years have come down to this, and this is a circle of despair. A movie without hope, without humanity, showing a world that no sane person would live in. "

962," NOT A ""DC FAN BOY"" but an early screener; people can see movies before released to the public NO SPOILERS
"," For those who are saying ""how you can rate this movie without seeing it your just a DC Fanboy"" you must not understand how the movie industry works. They allow people to screen movies early to get a feel for how audiences will receive the movie, they allow critics to see the movie early and also early screening for promotional purposes. The only reason your being ignorant to how the movie industry works is bc you don't like the political message of the film. If it was Captain Marvel you wouldn't be saying a word. This movie was fantastic especially the ending, but please see it for yourselves when available to the entire public. "
963," Lazy writing
"," Crazy good performance by Phoenix, the tv show scene at the end is total immersion rarely seen. Cinematography and soundtrack is also stellar.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand is really weak. Phillips decided - instead of actually say something real and of value that embarks discussions - to write a story about nothing as it's filled with red herrings across the board and an open ending. As we don't know what happened or not, about anything, everything is also without meaning. We can only guess.<br/><br/>It's just lazy writing to let the viewer guess what ever the happened or not. "
964," Fully masterpiece, brilliant Joacquin Pheonix
"," Well that to tell about this movie? A great setting back in the 80s, a hard to watch path of Arther Fleck, driving into total insanity portrayed by a great Pheonix, who really lives this role of a Criminal Clown. Not as in the comics, not as in the series or movies, its whole new way, a whole new level we could watch in Venice. Its a brilliant movie, showing us the problems to solve in our modern society. "
965," Very Disappointing
"," Film was directed and produced poorly. Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.<br/><br/>Gratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.<br/><br/>Disappointing connection to viewer. Film was wandering for long periods. Tons of footage that should have hit the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>I really wanted an stirringly creepy connection with Joaquin as Joker. It wasn't there.<br/><br/>If you are looking for Joaquin moment like in Gladiator, you will be very disappointed. "
966," Great acting - Terrible film
"," I was so looking forward to this film given all the hype about brilliant acting etc but yet again what a let down!<br/><br/>The film had no real storyline in the past or the present and although the acting was brilliant I had real trouble understanding the plot, if at all there was one.<br/><br/>ONE STAR IS FOR THE ACTORS "
967," Meh ...: Taxi Driver 2 with a clown

968," Depressing
"," The movie is just so sad. I felt uncomfortable, sad and depressed the entire time. Is that what the movie was supposed to do? Yea sure. But I left the movie theatre with such a gut wrenching feeling in my stomach and I cried for about an hour. It is two hours that will make you feel awful and sad, but the ending is kinda cool. "
969," Not equal to the sum of its parts.
"," Despite an extraordinary performance from Phoenix, the film itself is a sub-par experience. It's Taxi Driver lite, from someone who has seen the far superior film and completely failed to grasp its meaning. "
970," Sorry iron man no oscar for you this year
", Wow there's no word to describe this piece of art . 
971," Best ever
"," I used to think that it is impossible to fill the shoes of Heath Ledger's Joker, I am a huge fan of his. I was wrong. This was literally the best role I have seen in my life, speechless. The movie was great, but Joaquin was beyond that. "
972," Terrific Joaquin, just not the Joker
"," Overall, the acting is the best part of the movie. Most of all Joaquin, but also Di Niro and the wonderful Frances Conroy (big fan).
However, several skills of the Joker were left out, f. e. top strategist or excellent chemist. What was left is a so-and-so comedian bordering on looser turning into a psychopath. And please, the cliche of bad childhood and the mother did him wrong, etc.... Worth a big Joker laugh.
I also missed the grand finale, maybe Arthur is using the raids to increase them, creating chaos, etc.
In the end it is a good movie about the Character development from looser to psycho. Not new, but well done and acted. For me it is just not the title character.<br/><br/>I will be happy if Joaquin might get an Oscar or Frances as supporting actress, but can't see the movie deserving more awards.<br/><br/>About the often in the media mentioned brutality... Well brutal behavior in a movie about a psychopath.... Wow... I am shocked... Who would have thought... *end sarcasm* üòÇ "
973," Its definitely very good,but its definitely not worth the #10 spot its currently on
",
974," Most Hyped movie
"," Joker is kinda old wine in new bottle. it seems like most of the scenes are taken from the other movies and assembled in good fashion. Character in the movie and the story telling is not clear but diluted. if it is consider a movie as a story of a mental illness and how society take on these guys then definitely there are lots of movie that you may come up better than this and if you think about it as prior of
character joker development then it is not done right.<br/><br/>Actual Joker character hadn't neurological disorder or some sort of mental illness instead he was clever psycho. "
975," Joaquin Pheonix and great setpieces save a predictable, hole ridden plot
"," It's a really good film that conveys a relevant message. But it plays fast and loose with ""show don't tell"" while bridging the gap between one part of the story and the next. You might find yourself asking ""wait... how did things blow out of proportion so quickly?"" in regards to the world around Joker, and not really finding much of an answer beyond a couple of off-hand explanations. "
976," Great acting performance by phoenix...average movie
"," The performance of phoenix its great...right in the spot of a mental ill crazy person...the script its for an average film,you always gonna guess whats next...i think (Personal opinnion) that the movie it is what it is just by the performance of phoenix...If the joker had been leto this gonna be an awfull joker movie. "
977," A film that will be talked about for years to come.
"," I saw the joker film when it was released and I thought it was brilliant, it does have some violent moments but I thought it handled the issue very well, if people didn't like it then they should have known what they were getting themselves into when watching a movie about the iconic joker. Joaquin Phoenix to me did a marvelous portrayal of the Joker, his laugh is my favorite Joker laugh as it's how I imagine the laugh would sound straight from the comic book pages and he made the character his own interpretation, which I'm sure many people will be interested in seeing.<br/><br/>I can definitely see people talking about this film many years from now as people are still doing with The Dark Knight before it, if you haven't seen it already I would highly recommend watching the film. "
978," Fantastically Made in Every Aspect, Joker Stands Out in a Crowded Genre Landscape
",
979," Stunning but hard to watch
"," The hype is real but please go into this film with an open mind. The cinematography, score and acting are all absolutely faultless but the subject matter is disturbing and I felt myself turning away at points, just to give myself a breather. This wasn't due to the violence, but to see such a stark and visceral portrayal on mental illness and it's sociopolitical impact on the big screen was hard to swallow. I think anyone who has been through their own mental health struggles will feel the same.<br/><br/>The subtle nods to batman and the dark knight films were great, and gave just enough foundation to the story without it being a cliche 'Batman film' (not saying that in a derogatory way either - I'm a massive batman fan)<br/><br/>So worth a watch and a rewatch, and a massive bravo to Joaquin for a stunning performance. "
980," It is without a doubt a very good movie.
"," It has excellent acting cinematography, sound design, production design, colouring and of course acting. It is close to a masterpiece. It may even be one of this year's best movies.
It cannot be easily compared with superhero movies as it has its own unique expression.<br/><br/>Where this movie lacks; is making the final jump. Although the elements are there, the final jump seems a little forced. We know who Joker is and we saw who he was and WHY he became Joker. But the metamorphosis has a small gap.<br/><br/>Also the Joker we see; is immature yet, so the elements of his dark philosophy are missing.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie as piece of art, to all mature audiences. "
981," Dark, beautiful and mesmerising.
", This sure is a masterpiece. It is directed and acted so beautifully that you just can't believe someone really has given performance like that of Heath. The Dark story for which DC is famous for is really wonderful. When it's about JOKER no marvel can match it for sure (Not a DC or MARVEL fan still have to agree about last line). 
982," Amazing! But not what most people will expect.
"," This is not a DC movie. This is not a Batman universe movie. This is a movie about mental health, trauma, and dealing with childhood trauma. Joaquin Phoenix portrays the role amazingly....especially considering he is on the screen almost the entire film.
It's a tough movie to watch, seeing the downward spiral he is experiencing. But it's necessary for people to see this to help understand what others go through, and to help remove the stigma around mental health. "
983," Good story
", Good actor good story and good movie. Watching the movie again again and again 
984," I can't see this Joker being one step ahead of Batman.
", Other than that. This is a well directed movie with great performances. 
985," So disappointed by this film
"," Was really looking forward to seeing this film. However having seen it I am very disappointed
The acting was brilliant however I was bored unroll the last half an hour. I have never considered walking out a cinema until now<br/><br/>I would say you have to go and see it as you can see by the reviews some people love it "
986," No. Just No.
"," If you want to watch a superhero/villain movie, then go somewhere else. If you want to see a ""descent into madness"" movie, watch Taxi Driver instead. This is just that movie with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - instead of driving a taxi at the end, this guy puts on clown makeup.<br/><br/>The movie was also way to political, and it's message is just the same rehashed junk you get from most Hollywood movies nowadays. Just with more graphic violence and - oh yeah - clown makeup.<br/><br/>Phoenix does a fantastic job, which is why I gave this 2 stars rather than 1. But the movie is twice as long as it needs to be and is only half as good as it should have been. I'd rather take the 2 hours I sat through this to re-watch The Dark Knight, where we see the Joker that his movie should have been. "
987," Disappointed
"," I must say I'm disappointed. I love the Batman universe and especially the story behind Joker. Considering it's been a lot of talk around this movie, I expected more. The first half of the movie was pretty long drawn, towards the end it was great but not so much before that in my opinion. They could have done so much more with the time they had.
Also, something that I struggle with is that every move Joker made was very predictable basic psychology (my opinion). Joker isn't supposed to be predictable, that is a part that makes him so interesting. Besides from all that the actor did an amazing job potraying Joker! "
988," Send In The Goddamn clowns!
"," A freaking lengthy-as(s) break-down ahead,but worth it(I guess?)..
Might contain a few spoilers,but if you haven't watched it yet.SERIOUSLY,what are you doing with your life?
To begin with.Todd Phillips.Everyone's going,""man,he's the same guy,that directed The Hangover,right?how was such a guy,capable,of pulling this off?"",for starters,SO WHAT?,as a matter of fact,most of his movies,are comical,you only found The Hangover series?..
Jokes aside,Todd,has literally sculpted this masterpiece,frame by frame.I overheard,that this film,was influenced by Scorsese's-'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',and people were actually,debating,if they liked this film or not,solely,'cause of the fact that this derived some inspiration from cult-classics,like those two?
Beeyatch please!,this is a period film,and blends rather very well with the theme of 'King Of Comedy' and 'The Taxi Driver',so what's wrong,in drawing a little inspiration?annoyed that,this reminds you a lot of those two?(then,I really don't have an answer for that)
The music,scored by Hildur ""I-can't-pronounce-after-that"",was phenomenal,it adds on to the chilly vibes of the film,and instills fear in us,and makes us grateful,that we aren't(literally)on the receiving end of this clown's menace.
Her score,when Arthur dies(psychologically speaking) and The Joker,rises,in the bathroom,is just freaking too-good!
The man behind the cam,Lawrence,has killed it too!(I don't know much about the intricacy of cinematography,so don't really want to blabber,much)
Finally,Joaquin Phoenix.You must have,by now,heard,a lot of critical acclamations,praising his acting,and that,he really deserves an OSCAR,for this,and also,some clich√© comments,going ""Oh my God!,OSCAR deserves JOAQUIN,for his performance!""
Well,the HYPE IS TRUE! "
989," Joker's Wild

990," Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.
",
991," Weird does not mean Masterpiece
"," As strange a film as you will see, for some this may be a Monet of the film world, but weird is not always wonderful. For myself the film was Ok, I felt the story lacked credibility at times, as a piece of cinematography is will stand up, but the story will not be for everyone. "
992," As the film resonates, do not stifle reviews
"," It seems a few people are upset about any advance reviewing of The Joker here. If this is you, you will not last a minute in director Todd Phillips's deranged world. Pitiful as you will miss the sheer force of Phoenix channeling the incarnate mad man. This kind of acting, story, and cinematography is not for the weak of heart. Who knows if Oscar lover's will even know the higher level of what they are looking at. My guess is, when they realize it can not be compared to Ledger's portraying, they will have to see this Jokester for what he is, our inner darkness.... Rating 9 as perfection is for liars and cowards "
993," Disappointing
"," There was nothing mentally or emotionally intriguing about this film. Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character.
The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible.
As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims.
As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in. "
994," Even Joaquin needs a story
", The acting by JP is phenomenal but the disappointment from the movie is that that's the only thing to watch. Now you can understand that even Heath Ledger needed a Nolan and a Zimmer and Howard combo to make it legendary. 
995," Slow and way overrated based on these 9 and 10* reviews.
"," Move is slow. It's mainly about mental illness. Not The Joker. And I don't wanna hear Phoenix even holds a candle to Ledgers Joker. It's not close. Ledger is a legend and Phoenix is something to forget. For one, he is a soft, weak, milquetoast man (his character). It is surrounded by darkness but not the kind you like or can enjoy. It's a sad &amp; dreary played out movie that takes too long like someone that speaks a lot but doesn't say much. He isn't the Joker till roughly 20-25 minutes left. To sum it up, he smokes a cigarette, dances in a twirl, gets humiliated and laughs while crying for 3/4 of the movie. Spare me. It wasn't very good and is definitely overhyped. But I'm glad De Niro got his head blown off. "
996," A well shot and well acted student film
"," Throw a bunch of money at a great cinematographer and a great actor, then throw in some gratuitous senseless murder in a comic book universe and watch the fanboys drool. ""It's like Scorsese!"" Yes it's derivative, except made by the dudes who brought you Road Trip and Hangover 3. Clich√©s galore and hardly any suspenseful scene building. It's crap, don't fall for it. "
997," Vanilla. Just blah.
"," I really don't understand all the hype over this movie. I found it to be really boring.. and by the end of this boring, very predictable movie, I felt as though I just wasted my time and money.<br/><br/>The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the acting was good. "
998," Alright film... ruined really by the hype
"," Not sure this is the masterpiece everyone is raving about. It's all a bit predictable and samey.<br/><br/>There's no creativity... a copy script of king of comedy and copying the character of taxi driver.
As for Joaquin Phoenix, I don't know why it's an amazing performance. He lost some weight, danced, laughed, pulled some silly faces and really just played it like I expected him too... No killer scenes or memorable lines, nothing out of the ordinary or surprising.<br/><br/>It's not a film you'll watch again, unlike other joker performances, quite dull and boring throughout waiting for a big scene which never delivers. I left just not really feeling anything for it... hmmm yh it was alright. "
999," A great performance but not a great origin movie
",
1000," Slow build with a great payoff
"," This is a slow movie, but there are violent scenes of action throughout to keep you interested. This movie is not ""that"" violent, but it is the most violent movie based on a DC character. You see people get shot in the head with blood flying out, people getting their heads smashed in with brains showing, and well as people getting got multiple times in the chest.<br/><br/>This movie has some good twist and turns I didn't see coming and it has a great final act.<br/><br/>9/10 "

Joaquin Phoenix really pulled off this intense character. Oscar for Phoenix!<br/><br/>Just a perfect storyline was missing, otherwise it would be a jaw-dropping movie. "
1004," A masterclass in acting nothing more
"," I don't often review movies but as an avid movie goer I just can't see what the fuss is about.
Movies are made to entertain and enrich, bring joy, elation and all the emotions that human beings are capable of.
The Joker does none of this.
True it is a masterclass in acting and Phoenix truly is superb but as a piece of film entertainment it falls very short.
It lumbers along for too long trying to build a picture of a broken man who finally snaps and in today's society that really could be anyone.
Everyone is stressed, times are hard and it doesn't take much to push someone to the edge.
The flashes of what will eventually become the Joker as we know him are very far and few between and in these moments between the movie languishes into a portrait of self pity.
Great acting. Great actor. Not a great movie. "

When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.<br/><br/>Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.<br/><br/>Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.<br/><br/>Film of the year? Nope. "

1009," Unreasonable & gloomy movie
"," Cannot understand why this movie gets high score. The content is so bad, gloomy and unreasonable. It is exaggerated too much. How can a mad guy who kill 03 men become a symbol for a mad society??? How can rich men always badly treat or make difficulty to poor guy??? Any reason for a mad crowd tries to protest a senator who is just only standing as a candidate for President position???
Three stars for the good performance of main character. "
1010," Overhyped movie , acting is great but story is mediocre
"," I loved the acting but movie is Overhyped.
Story is not upto the mark . They should have sticked to the original comic book origin of the joker instead of this . I have a seven just for the acting of Joaquin he is the only reason movie is a little good. "

1012," Over-hyped, overacted with no proper entertainment - The Millennial Joker
"," Absolute disappointment. I believed the hype like a fool. No person that actually saw it told me it was a good movie, just the stupid reviews. It's so cringe, with nothing actually happening except Phoenix smoking and dancing around. There is no action, no substance, no humor. Everything is so cringe and overacted.
I suppose if you like those independent movies at TIFF or Cannes this is something for you. If you actually wanna be entertained and see The Joker from the DC, this is not it.
Best description is millennial joker. Society is mean to him, nobody gives him anything so he cries and complains about it to get attention. When none is given, he starts killing. "

1015," Just as I expected
"," It is safe to say that this movie is not for everyone. DC fan or not, this is about the origin of one of the most notorious characters in entertainment. So far in previous movies we have only seen the clown prince of crime Joker. The criminal who went crazy and took things so far. But here the story is the origin of the mentally sick Joker, the simple man who had a rough life and started to act on his own will instead of acting according to what people expect. This movie is dark and grim, it is a dramatic tale and an excellent performance by Joaquin Phoenix and everyone in the cast. They made it look so real and relatable to our life that the idea of a real life joker is not far fetched any more.
I hope that DC continues in this direction and give us a new approach to the stories we love. "

1020," Heath Ledger Would've Loved This!
"," I consider Joker another masterpiece. Brilliant storyline, outstanding direction and writing by Todd Philips, staggeringly suspenseful score, vivid cinematography and above all, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing and sublime performance as the Joker. I was speechless with astonishment by the end of this film. To reiterate, Heath Ledger would've loved this masterpiece; I wish he was still alive today. Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of an ordinary man who gradually transforms into Gotham's most mercurial, menacing, and diabolical criminal through his mentality and despair caused by rejection and humiliation from society was a central pillar of this film. In my experience, I was seeing Joker, not Joaquin Phoenix, for the entire movie through his erratic behavior, abnormal laughter, and irresistible dance moves. He has once again proven himself an extraordinary actor. The suspenseful score complements the dark theme as it strongly implies Arthur Fleck's imminent downfall. Although the ending was quite intense, I truly consider this as an Oscar-worthy movie that deserves the utmost recognition. "
1021," Hitler or the Joker
"," People are generally fascinated with what makes heroes and villains do what they do, whether it's real-life villains like Hitler or fictional characters like the Joker or Darth Vader. The first six episodes of Star Wars were all about the story of Darth Vader, how a little boy became the galaxy's ultimate villain, who terrorized and killed without mercy. So, thanks to ""Joker,"" we now understand how he became the evil character that he is. A key question, though is, when you step back from a movie, book, or any artistic creation, has it made the world better or worse? Really, that's a good question for any human endeavor. I think the first six episodes of Star Wars left the world better. Yes, we understood Vader; we understood how his circumstances and choices made him evil. Yet, when he became evil, he stayed evil; his violent acts were reviled. And, of course, ""SPOILER ALERT"", we were gratified by his redemption. 'Joker' doesn't do the same with the Joker. That's a problem, a big problem. "
1022," Let's look at some math
"," I understand why people are excited for this film and I'm afraid it's clouded everyone's judgement. There are some insane flaws in this story regardless of it being an original origin story. While trying to pull from such films as King of Comedy, Taxi Driver and Fight Club to attempt at bringing a fresh look at The Joker there is 1 major glowing flaw in everyone face that I have yet to see anyone talk about.
In any origin story you bring to the character the Joker it all leads to the same road, an enemy in Batman. We can all agree on that, without that regardless of origin story you have no Joker character at all.
So explain to me how Arthur being at least 30 and that's being kind because let be honest, he looks no younger than 40 in this film, is going to fight Bruce aka Batman who we see him interact with at the age of at the oldest 12. By the time Bruce would become Batman the Joker will be pushing 65/70.
The film is lost the second we see Arthur and Bruce on screen.
Had this film been a story about a young boy who was troubled and saw Arthur character this inspiring the Joke I would have loved it. Unfortunately it's not and everyone seems excited to see Batman fight a Joker in a wheelchair with this origin story.
Heath will forever own this role and the character should stop there. "
1023," E for effort.
"," It was refreshing watching ""Joker"" in the theater (AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY). It was really nice watching a movie that took a new approach to (somewhat) familiar material. It was nice seeing a movie that challenges the audience. For the most part, ""Joker"" succeeds in what it was trying to do. Writer/ director Todd Phillips and company deserve a lot of credit. The best thing about this movie is its look. It really feels like that time and place. The problem that I had with ""Joker"" is that it seemed to wear out its welcome after a while. Joaquin Phoenix gives a good performance. But if I was supposed to somehow sympathize with his character's plight, I didn't. I didn't really care about him or any of the other characters for that matter. When you watch a movie and don't really care about the people you're watching you can start to lose interest. I didn't look at my watch during ""Joker"" but I was tempted. Dishonorable mention: a miscast Robert De Niro. "

"," This by far is the best film of 2019. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix take us on a mesmerizing and uncomfortable journey. The score, cinematography, the writing, and acting is flawless. I was hooked from start to finish and the character development that we saw with arthur fleck was on point. Its not an action movie nor really a superhero movie. The only villain we focus on is the joker and we see a bit of thomas waynes life. The hype is real and i couldnt of loved this movie more. "
1026," Joker
"," From the likes of Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Zach Galifianakis, the iconic Batman/CD Comics character remains a highly distinctive and challenging role, and this stand-alone (not a spin-off, and no sequel planned, yet) explores his origins, directed by Todd Phillips (Road Trip, The Hangover, War Dogs). Basically, set in 1981, Gotham City, socially inept and mentally troubled Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) works as a clown-for-hire for a company called Ha-Ha's. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian, like his television hero, comic and talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro). Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) in a place rife with crime and unemployment, with much of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a disorder that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, he depends on social services for medication, and he is disregarded and mistreated by society. After being attacked in an alley by a gang Arthur's co-worker, Randall (Glenn Fleshler), lends him a gun. Arthur invites his neighbour, single mother Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz), to his debut stand-up comedy performance, and they begin dating. While entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen. He takes out the gun and shoots two of the men in self-defence and executes the third. The murders are condemned by billionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen), a candidate to become mayor of the city. He labels those envious of more successful people as ""clowns"". Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks. The social service program is hit by funding cuts, leaving Arthur without medication. Arthur's comedy show goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the routine on his show. Arthur berates his mother when she reveals the truth, as seen written in a letter to Thomas Wayne, alleging that he may be Thomas' illegitimate son. At Wayne Manor, Arthur talks to Thomas' young son, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson), but gets into a scuffle with family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Douglas Hodge) and flees. Following a visit from Gotham Police Detective Burke (Shea Whigham) and Detective Garrity (Bill Camp) who are investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is taken to hospital. At a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's case file; it reveals that he was adopted as a baby and Penny allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. Penny alleged that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption and commit her to the asylum to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur goes to the hospital and kills Penny, smothering her with a pillow. He enters Sophie's apartment unannounced; a frightened Sophie tells him to leave; their previous encounters were Arthur's delusions. Arthur is surprised to receive an invitation to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his routine clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary (Celebrity Juice's Leigh Gill). Arthur murders Randall in retaliation for getting him fired but allows Gary to leave unharmed for treating him well in the past. Arthur dyes his hair green, paints his face, and dons a new red suit ready for his performance. On the way to the studio, he is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with clown protesters. One accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape in the chaos. Before the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as Joker, a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to a warm reception but tells morbid jokes. With nothing to lose, he admits that he killed the men on the train, and rants about how society abandons the disenfranchised and how Murray mocked him. Arthur kills Murray and is arrested as riots break out across Gotham. One rioter follows the Wayne family into an alley and murders Thomas and his wife Martha (Carrie Louise Putrello), sparing a traumatized Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. He dances to the cheers of the crowd, satisfied that his dedication has finally been achieved. At Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand the joke. He runs from orderlies, leaving a trail of bloody footprints. Also starring Brian Tyree Henry as Carl the Arkham Clerk and Hannah Gross as Young Penny. Phoenix delivers a chilling and compelling as the man who slowly loses his sanity and turns to a life of crime, and De Niro does well with his time onscreen as the man the luckless loner admires and one of the men (along Wayne) he obsesses over. This works well as a character study showing how monsters are made, an origins story about the Dark Knight's arch-nemesis, and a nod to the Martin Scorsese film The King of Comedy (and not just casting De Niro), and it makes room to take a swipe against at healthcare cuts and poverty. It is very controversial and very dark, with its crime elements, moments of violence and brutality, and featuring the song ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" by Gary Glitter (with what we know about the singer, it may be wrong to find this song catchy, but I don't care), and it is at times depressing and uncomfortable, but what else would you expect (?), a gritty and great psychological thriller. Very good! "

1032," Best Origin story of the Joker(MAJOR SPOILERS!!)
"," I saw the movie this weekend. I had very high hopes for the movie.<br/><br/>When I saw it, it was better than I expected. The movie deals with psychology about a man who lives in a society where rich and poor are divided. The film states the main problem:Social classes. Rich are given more importance and the poor are made to suffer and live impoverished lives. Arthur is suffering the most throughout the film.<br/><br/>Examples of social classes are shown throughout the film:One in Particular is the train scene where three Wayne Enterprises businessmen are bullying a poor girl and this reminds the Arthur about his life. He yearns to be noticed and wants to be recognized, but Gotham never gave him a chance and mentally and physically abused him. While he did do bad things in the movie, there were many reasons that pushed Arthur over the edge:<br/><br/>1. He was beaten up by a group of teens(I hate them) and left there crying. His boss was angry at him, just because he lost a sign?!, not because he was assaulted!?<br/><br/>2. A guy he thought to be his friend gave him a gun for protection, but when it was revealed, he used Arthur as a scapegoat. Arthur was fired for something his friend did. This explains why he killed Randall, but spared Gary, since Gary WAS nice towards him.<br/><br/>3. His adoptive mother Penny abused him and gave him a head injury, that caused his uncontrollable laughter.<br/><br/>4. His favorite comedian host made fun of him by playing his laughing video. Throughout the film, Arthur wanted to be like him and imagined him liking him, but in the end, he was just like the rich, spoiled people of Gotham.<br/><br/>Therefore, the Joker ended up getting at the end what he wanted his whole life:respect and fame. The Clowns hailed him as a hero and it put a smile on his face, even when he was imprisoned.<br/><br/>Amazing movie! This should be made canon to a DC movie. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an amazing performance. "
1033," One of the best films I've ever had the pleasure of watching in my life!
"," The acting is superb. Each scene had me captivated-Joaquin superbly gave each scene such in depth detail-I immediately watched it a second time. The directing was phenomenal.

The music is so powerful, the camera angles are perfect. Joaquin Phoenix is incredibly beautiful in his acting, I'm in awe of him in this movie. Mental illness is real, it's everywhere.

"," 'Joker' is an excellent character-piece on a man that gets beaten down in his world and changes into a terrifying symbol for others. Joaquin Pheonix's portrayal is unforgettable, carrying the film and making the character feel as real as possible. Though the movie may be slow for some, it is necessary to show all the events that are necessary to transform a character in this manner.

The storyline, cinematography, facial expressions, symbolism, acting: all perfect as far as I'm concerned. Take a dark look into how abandoned people only fall deeper into abandonment as a family, community, and society neglects to acknowledge their suffering. If this movie doesn't force you to self-reflect-- both in relation to the joker and those who treated him poorly-- nothing will. "

1047," An Uncomfortable Masterpiece
"," 'Joker' is an uncomfortable masterpiece that will leave you walking away from the movie theatre confused about how you feel. It's a conversation piece that anchors itself deep into the origins, mentality and motivations of a disturbing psychopathic anarchist.<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everyone, especially if what you're expecting to see is a thrilling face off between a villain and a superhero. But if your going into this movie wanting to see and feel something you've never seen or felt before, then you're in for one hell of an experience.<br/><br/>Most films will leave you with a short term emotion, this film is one of few leaving you with many long term emotions that take a while to process, and that, in my opinion, is what makes a movie deserving of 10/10. "
1048," Oh wow!!
"," What a great movie and what a performance of Joachim Phoenix.
People who don't like this movie please next time go to a CGI packed no brainer Marvel movie because this movie is totally different.
I didn't even see it as an superhero movie because there aren't any in here.
There is so many potential in the Joker character and Phoenix did the job so damn good that I hope there will be a sequel. "
1049," Disturbed movie with few highligts

"," This film has the criteria to be the first film with a main character that can stand alone and increase the element of suspense without the need of multiple character crosses.<br/><br/>Think of it for a moment, There is no a single scene that will make you question the characters choices. And man... the way they developed the Joker here is magnificent, with a mind-blowing performance from Joaquin and a great cinematography... this is by far the best movie I have seen in years !<br/><br/>10/10 "

Well this movie has less than 10% voilence in the last Tarintino movie which was completly pointless as far as the story goes. But yet ""Once Upon a Time in Holywood"" scored so well in metascore. Compared to that, this movie should have scored an above 85 in metascore. Are the critics sold to Disney to sabotage any DC/WB based movie? "

Everything about this film is just perfect and is the acting! Joaquin Phoenix needs to continue portraying as the Joker in the rest of the films where they will have the Joker because Phoenix is the TRUE JOKER. He is a huge difference than the other Joker actors in the past. He is so much better than anyone else! This film and Joaquin Phoenix are so amazing, so brutal, so dark, so thriller, so entertaining, so shocking, so watchable, so enjoyable!!! I rate this film a 10 out of 10! I'm gonna be very upset if they dont give Joaquin Phoenix an oscar because he deserves it!!! He is an incredible actor!! I'm also gonna be upset if they dont continue using Joaquin Phoenix to portray as the Joker in the films because he is the only actor who does a perfect job as the Joker! GIVE JOAQUIN PHOENIX AN OSCAR! CONTINUE FILMS WITH JOAQUIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER! "
1053," A mesmorizing character study, with a brilliant performance from Pheonix
"," As you've probably heard by now, Joker is a comic book film unlike anything we've ever seen before. It chooses to focus on it's iconic lead character in a very down to earth, dark and twisted story that mostly stays far away from any sort of storyline found in the Batman comics. This film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who slowly descends into madness and revolts against the world around him.
Joaquin Phoenix is incredible in this. He portrays Arthur in with so many subtle movements and expressions that makes Arthur feel like a real person. Phoenix even stamps his own name on Joker's laugh, ensuring it stands out from everyone else. He's in every single scene, and he eats up every minute of the runtime.
This character is incredibly complex, and every scene portrays his descent into madness. It will be a film that will likely require multiple viewings to catch every detail. The film can be slow but every scene is important to Arthur's breakdown and by the end of the film, you will see a character that has become completely full circle. It's incredible to watch in a movie that will be remembered for a very, very long time. "
1054," Lives Up To The Hype
"," Nothing much to say except, this is what cinema should be. An amazing film and the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix! Arthur's further descent into madness portrayed perfectly. We can all identify with sadness, Phoenix's performance makes you sympathize with this disturbed, neglected man. This was the best film I have seen in a long time. "
1055," Absolutely AWESOME
"," Juaquin Phoenix was riveting, intense, believable, depressing, and wonderful. He WAS Arthur Fleck. Definitely not for children. Very deep and makes you stop to think about how you truly treat people. "
1056," I have no words
"," When I saw the trailer, I knew this movie would be something else. But actually, I wasn't ready for THAT. This isn't just a movie, it's a complete masterpiece. Here, you understand how the joker became this evil. It's heart-breaking, emotional, whatever you want but you can't stay marble in front of this. "
1057," Must watch movie.
"," Though the movie JOKER is kind of brutal, it serves an eye-opener to each one of us.
Depression is a really serious issue and a lot of people are experiencing this. They may look happy on the outside but we don't know that these people are facing some issues in their everyday life such as being bullied.
We should be mindful of our actions and words being uttered. Never make fun of other people's feelings as this can make someone feel crazy, feel depressed and worst, causing them to end their own lives. "

My wife and I found it an awesome production, director effort and actor excellence.
Brings the Joker to humaness, and sets up the character to be exploited in the Batman Saga's. "
1069," never go full retard
"," The movie encourages to think. From the beginning, I knew that the film could be questionable to a certain extent.<br/><br/>I just expected it to be different. Based on the joker image of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, I was convinced that the Joker would commit violence for the sake of chaos like Tyler Durden in Fight Club or boredom and pure narcissism like Patrick Bateman in American Psycho. 'Do I really look like a guy with a plan?' or 'some people just want to watch the world burn' are inseparably connected with the character for me. The Joker is crazy. But to become the symbol of a movement and to hide from the judiciary in the longer term, it also requires a certain genius.<br/><br/>There is nothing like this to be seen or even implied in this movie. The Joker here is broken, deeply hurt and pitiful - very well acted though - but just not cunning. The good news is that he cannot inspire imitators like that. "

"," It is a very daring movie, to say the least. Excellent performances and exceptional movie overall. 'Masterpiece' is how I would describe it. Some viewers will be left feeling uneasy. What a character! Todd Phillips has done justice to this version of Joker, and I'm glad! Please don't let children watch this. "
1072," The kind of cinema we deserve and need right now.
"," Ignore the biased negative media coverage, this film is great, it is exactly the kind of cinema we need in 2019, intelligent, challenging, gripping, and above all, rewarding. It is a solid script with a solid pay off that will not disappoint you. It's not a blockbuster cookie-cutter made with the primary objective of making as many billions as possible, it's actual art which is becoming rare in cinemas these days. Joaquin Phoenix totally knocks it out of the park. "

1077," A movie with a message!
", First of all. It's such a well constructed world. Closer to reality than any other Gotham I've seen but just skewed enough to be different.<br/><br/>It's harsh and brutal but also lays society/humanity bare.<br/><br/>I'm not a Batman movie fan in general and I felt this was something different. Definitely worth a watch!

1079," An Honest Review: Cinematic Piece of Art
"," This movie is the first to actually compel me to begin writing reviews. First of all, yes, this movie is great, but I wanted to give it a fair score unlike what it's been given by the mainstream. It is as if the majority of the people writing such reviews haven't even seen the movie themselves. No this movie does not invoke or persuade anarchist violence, nor is it meant to be the happy/feel-good type that many super hero movies portray. This is a movie of the devolution of man, who happens to fit into the comic book fiction world of Gotham. Don't bring your children to see this, it is not meant for them - it is meant for those mature enough to understand an amazing character study that Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix place on the big screen. This movie was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in years, one that kept me engrossed from beginning to end without falter. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie, and don't read the critics' reviews. They're just degenerates looking for a big hit headline. Joker is 10/10, up there with the likes of Taxi Driver. "
1080," Simply amazing!
"," I knew this film would be great as soon as I've heard of it and the main character - Joaquin Phoenix...jusy wow!
So believable, he makes you relive the pain he goes through and feel his emotions.

1081," Just incredible
"," Not much else to say about this. Watch it, love it it. Greatest movie of the year. "
1082," Oscar time
"," Joker. Can two actors win Oscar's for playing the same character? Hell. Yes. Joaquin Phoenix acts his arse off in this stunning cinematic tour de force. His portrayal of a man's descent into madness and violence truly equals, if not surpasses, Robert De Nero's Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. This is hands down the best film Troy has seen this year. The recreation of '70s New York (Gotham City) was first rate, as was the score. Stunning. Five stars. "

1086," The Rise of the Clown Prince
"," The hype is real ladies and gentlemen, this is easily one of the finest films I have ever watched. This isn't just another CGI fueled movie with a superficial plot and big explosions trying to make up for it.
This isn't a mindless superhero, ahem, super villain movie. This is a deep and disturbing character study of what could happen to a person under highly excruciating, albeit, very realistic circumstances. To say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck was superb, would be an understatement. He has a way to convey his character's emotions on a level that will make you feel for him and equally disturb you. This isn't your typical ""villain-falls-in-a-tub-of-acid"" origin story, and the fact that society or lack thereof can have such an impact and break a man in such a way, makes it that much more terrifying to watch.
""Joker"" is sure to provoke some interesting talks long after leaving the theater. A must watch. "

Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar, a golden globe, an Olympic gold medal,a Nobel prize, a ballon d'or, Knighthood, a champions league winner medal and a presidential medal of freedom for his performance as the joker. "
1093," Ignore the critics

1094," Dark Disturbing Masterpiece
"," Let me start with how amazing Phoenix portrays Joker. I see a lot of negative reviews on the news and online, to be honest I don't believe these viewers are watching it the way its intended to be. Its a dark gritty story of how Joker became Joker, what people are calling political is simply the view the Joker has on the world.<br/><br/>I am really impressed with the writing to filming the acting just everything, I've never sat in a cinema that's been more quiet than the Joker to how immersed everyone was. Absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Whatever your views are watch this ignore all bad reviews and please find out for yourself. World class. "
1095," Go watch the Movie for an Unbridled Performance from Phoenix. And for the Filmmakers who had the Determination with go through with a Disturbingly Brilliant Ventures.

1096," Masterpiece
"," That's how good Joker actually is. We cried in Batman Begins and BVS on the death of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne but In Joker we rejoiced their deaths. The creation of Joker is certainly a journey which if it stays fictional its a bliss but if it happens in reality its a curse.
I have to say I have never rejoiced over an Antagonist killing civilians or father of Bruce Wayne.ha Damn I loved the movie "

1102," A masterpiece
"," As someone who dosent ussually watch superhero movies, especially dc, I had some doubts about joker, Joaquin Phoenix's oscar worthy performance makes this already an amazing film, its refreshing to see a superhero movie that dosent rely on cgi and fights to tell an amazing story "

1104," Had high hopes
"," I had high hopes for this title, but sadly they werent met. I think Phoenix does an amazing job acting. But the actual movie is for me boring, tedious and predictable.
I wont say ""dont watch"" or ""do watch"". This review is purely my opinion. I have seen it, but don't need to see it ever again. "
1105," What is the point of this movie?
"," Is it that the Joker is justified in becoming a serial killer because he was abused as a child and was attacked on the street and on the subway?<br/><br/>Or is he justified in becoming a mass murderer because people didn't laugh at his jokes, and a famous person made fun of him on TV about not being funny?<br/><br/>Or is it that we should be more careful about letting a mentally disturbed person get a gun?<br/><br/>Or is it that we should prevent a private person from giving a gun to someone else without official background checks?<br/><br/>Or is it that our society is so messed up that one logical response is to become a wacked-out maniac who goes around murdering people who have done him wrong?<br/><br/>Or is it something else?<br/><br/>One thing it is NOT, is entertainment. This movie is about as enjoyable as swimming in sewage.<br/><br/>The 4 stars is because it was well-written, the plot was logical, and it succeeded in making you feel bad for the Joker. And because Joaquin Phoenix did a great acting job.<br/><br/>But what is the point of this movie? Is it to say that we must stand by as society collapses into a putrid mess? That the bad guy will ultimately win? No thanks. "
1106," Nerve-wracking, but in very uncomfortable way
"," Why everybody keep saying it's a good movie? it's a movie about psycho getting more psycho and nothing more.Good acting? Well if you like crazy laugh 20 times in a movie, then maybe. People keep saying it has a ""deeper meaning"". Really? This is deep??? Uhm... OK. This move sucks, don't bother watching it. "
1107," Fake reviews alert!
"," I'm a great fan of the Dark Knight Joker and I can say with absolute confidence this movie DOES NOT deserve any rating close to Dark Knight. DC must go back to Nolan to bring back the Joker that we love. Acting 7.5, overall movie 5.5. Rotten is lenient to give it 69. That brings me to question the validity of IMDb reviews. I'm telling you they are simply FAKE! "
1108," aMasterpiece!
", This movie is such a beautiful tribute to taxi driver and the king of comedy by Scorsese. Phoenix deserves absolutely an oscar for his joker and Todd Phillips.... he proved to be monstrously good at the direction like never before. Just applause 
1109," Watch Taxi Driver instead
"," This is a poor attempt to use the comic books to sell a rip off of Taxi Driver, the movie strays too far from the comics and smacks of trying too hard to get awards. It has no relevance to the comics other than a few names and set in Gotham and tries too hard to be the type of movie that will get nominations for awards. This is no criticism of the actors by the way, I actually thought they did a good job with what they were given but the movie just wasn't good, it dragged and felt longer than it was. There are much better DC movies out there and better versions of the Joker too. "
1110," A psychotic drive
"," DC kept on disappointing it's fans by spending a lot on cinematography and animations but this time this will be a real masterpiece. With an amazing cinematic experience, we will see good acting also which makes it one of the most anticipated movies of DC. "
1111," Piece of garbage
"," Such a waste of time and money. Boring as hell..!!
If it would be possible I would give it -10!!!
Overrated....!!!!
I guess all because of paid reviews. "
1112," Over-rated
"," The first hour is a boar with too much emphasis upon protraying what we already know...the Joker is crazy. Two senseless murders, one too graphic.
Hopefully the sequel will be better.
Good acting by Jaquine. "
1113," Overrated
"," An astonishing performance by Phoenix, however the film as a whole whilst cleverly done is overrated. Worth a watch, but no need to rush. "
1114," Disappointing as always
"," JP has one and only acting register : the depressed looser, I don't understand the critics he is as mediocre as always. Save your money and re-watch Heath ledger's joker. "
1115," Just like great painting art in in the eye of the beholder, guess I need glasses but i don't think so.
"," I have seen Jokers and this is not my joker. I know lots of reviewers gave this a 10 out of 10 score yet I almost walked out of the movie. It had no greatness for me. Phoenix did a great performance but it become too repetitious for me. Also, this guy had to have lost a lot of weight as he showed a shockingly thin body. I will say I enjoyed the credits at the end. The yellow lettering against the black background allowed for clean clear reading of all who worked on this movie. As the only dissenter in the reviews I am sure most will believe the others. Sorry just was not my cup of tea. "
1116," No Jokes
"," JP is an undeniably intense actor who certainly puts his soul into what he does. Everything from the honored actor is well-made as a work of art. But now the movie is not called JP but the Joker and that is where the fun ends. A movie cannot start and end with a solo performance if everything is empty around. It is truly a totally entertaining film that lacks momentum altogether. It also deviates so much from the original that I would like to say that it is no longer a DC movie, but instead a film about a seriously ill person who only feels compassion for himself. No, even though I bought the ticket, I don't buy the movie concept. "
1117," A Banal and Pointless Exercise
"," If Todd Phillips wanted to spend $55 million on creating yet another pointlessly glorified, anti-hero and attempt to pass it off as a case study of a mentally ill agent being displaced by society, he could've at least spent a portion of that budget employing people who are able to contribute honest, fair, and much-needed portrayals of actual disaffected minorities in society. "
1118," A cinematic masterpiece
"," No words no words just an amazing movie with all things needed to establish the joker !!!!
This movie is beyond awards üòçüòçüòçüòç "
1119," Terrible
"," The only thing good about this movie is Phoenixs acting. But i dont (and most people dont) watch movies for acting alone. Good acting doesnt make this movie interesting, entertaining or give it a real plot. What a terrible script and terrible story. Barely any character development (or characters for that matter) outside of Joker. The last 10 minutes were the best part, but to force me to sit through the first 2 hours of garbage to get to it was punishment. Why was this movie even made? They couldve condensed the plot into a 30 minute tv special and made it better than what it was. I cant believe how overrated this movie is, but then again most movies written primarily for oscars usually are. "
1120," Noble effort, but largely style over substance.
"," I respect the unusual effort to try and do a movie about a comic book supervillain. But, the Joker still remains largely a cipher. Sure he's crazy, a bit tortured, and he loves anarchy. The problem is, it is all style and no substance. A movie about a crazy person being crazy isn't that interesting, enlightening or entertaining. Having a character that has traumatic brain injury as the driving cause of his delusions and schizophrenia doesn't really work. What makes the Joker an intriguing character is ability to see ourselves (just a little bit) in the character. Which is why the Joker is more interesting as a character who reached his breaking point and went totally over to the ""dark side."" Sorta like Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down."" He clearly has shades of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" in him, but that character's descent to the dark side was MUCH more interesting.<br/><br/>The movie lightly touches on some interesting themes, but the finale isn't earned. The self-aware soliloquy at the end isn't earned. Indeed, that awareness is contrary the back story that was developed. But, in the end it has enough style in the direction and acting to keep your attention. But, it needed a lot more than a cooky, dancing, skinny Joaquin Phoenix to make it work. Although it was a different type of movie, I still think Heath Ledger's Joker was much better. "
1121," are u talking to me?
"," Yea nothing original in this movie. i'm sure todd was a big taco driver<br/><br/>people will act they love it and when it comes on hbo they will not be able to make it through a rewatch.if this movie was named ""clown"" half the audience wouldn't have made it through the first viewing.<br/><br/>yea good actors can act... but the most impressive thing is how great a cash grab this was by making a inexpensive blockbuster with only a few mouths to feed. "
1122," Not worth the ticket !
"," JOKER character should have been much better presented in a more psycho-path life. Suffering like in the movie is not a good cause for such a character to rise. I expected a lot from a movie rated over 9, and really disappointed with it. We were 8 watching and 4 said not worth the ticket. Hoaquin did a great job, but the scenario and directing were poor. "
1123," Great acting but....
"," There is a LOT of hype around this film, and a lot of people seem to think it's great, and whilst I agree Joaquin's performance is brilliant, I was bored stiff for most of this. The kind of film I'd turn off if it was on tv. I may have been harsh on the stars but I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was far from it. If I want art I'll go to a gallery. "
1124," Jokes on us
"," Horribly shallow, derivative and repugnant. Dramatically flawed - actually the story of the mother told through the excruciatingly telescoped lens of the son. In the process it vilifies just about everyone (but no points for consistency because if they'd had the guts, a struggle with sexuality might have actually made it interesting {I can't help thinking the thought was on Joaquin's mind but the film declared otherwise}). One of the profound master strokes of Ledger's portrayal was to specifically preclude the need of an origin story yet like so many the need to have that incredible manifestation explained willed me to my seat for the whole acrid, eat-all-your-stinky-seventies-references-or-there's-no-dessert duration. What is eventually slopped out in response to the riddle of the joker (I promise to take that no further) however is so remarkably banal that it better serves to illuminate the gluttonous, exploitative villainy of the corporations behind the production. That said, production values were decent although I couldn't help comparing the dim cinematography to the exquisitely stark visions of the Nolan movies. "
1125," Has the Joker Been Forgotten?
",
1126," White fragility
"," At first, this film seems to be about how Arthur is the victim of a cruel world. He does have a condition, but Arthur cannot handle life-he is not good at dealing with women, he makes poor decisions (gun at work), and has no self-confidence. And feels the world owes him something, and when he doesn't get it, he murders people.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro's character confronts Arthur about his self-pity, and Arthur, unwilling to face his own shortcomings, kills him too. He is actually very similar to any common mass shooter. Arthur is a weak man trying to find strength and relevance.<br/><br/>Yes, Arthur's circumstances are bad, but he lives under the same conditions as many others. Yet he is the one that responds by killing people that he doesn't like or that were ""mean"" to him. His social worker in the beginning tells Arthur that society disregards people like the BOTH of them. His neighbor is a single black mother who is dealing with similar circumstances in the same rat infested city, and yet she carries on. Neither of these women went on a killing spree.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the anarchist crown him king. If this movie continued, the masses would realize that Arthur is a self-centered coward that has no agenda other than seeking attention. This movie is an example of fragility at its finest. Joker is a victimizer disguised as a victim. "
1127," Usually I don't review movies, but this one...
"," This is first movie I watched and review on this site. Well, watch this movie if you have absolutely little else to do. I found it very boring, longish, and at the end of the movie in theatre I was about to fall asleep. This boring it was. I mean people, you better entertain yourself watching washing machine going, two hours straight. Would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is just boring as hell. "
1128," Imbalanced?
"," A deeply sad and very troubling film. Reminds me a lot of 'The Mechanic' starring Christian Bale, in that the movie is a study of the character rather than the wider story around it.<br/><br/>Would liked to have seen more about Joker's effects on wider society rather than spending 90% of the film demonstrating why he is psychotic.<br/><br/>The cinematography and acting across the board was almost flawless. Phoenix will undoubtably be a serious contender for best actor this year. "
1129," Predictable, just for Joker's fans
"," Half of the movie is amazingly slow and dramatic. In my opinion it is really predictable after the first ten minutes. It is not a bad movie but It is also not one of my ""master-piece"" movies list. "
1130," Todd Phillips is the Joker
",
1131," Overhyped, but it's alright
"," It's a good film but I don't see this as a 10 like many here did, early reviews are usually from some marketing company to hype things up.<br/><br/>Movie started slow ... don't expect much to happen 'til the middle and it's climax. Cinematography is good. Joker's acting is fine... if a little forced at times, it's just strange but acceptable. "
1132," Dark, Depressing, Slow, Heavy, and More of That
"," Joaquin did his job, kudos; it was a tough role. I understand that it's the backstory character development of the Joker. Sorry, I love movies of all genres, but this was simply not entertaining. I didn't want to walk out, but I didn't want to stay. Too heavy for too long. How many depressing things need to be spoon fed to get the point that he's depressed and ready to react? For all those Keith Ledger comments, perhaps they are paid reviews. Keith Ledger's character was interesting, inventive and charismatic (in a maniacal way), this character is depressed, dark and creepy (in an uninteresting way).<br/><br/>If you love the Batman ecosystem, great, this probably fills a gap. If you have some relationship with mental illness and you need a cathartic moment, great, this may catalyze a reaction. But, if you want a well-paced and well-told entertaining story, perhaps a different choice for the evening. "
1133," What a waste
", I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie. What i got was an awkward incredibly boring film. All that hype for something that is 60% the joker being awkward. I kept waiting for it to pick up and become interesting. I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least. Like many critically acclaimed films this movie was a complete joke to me. 
1134," A mote stilelish class of cinema

1135," Not real Joker
", This movie is poorly done as to how it tells the story. It is a dark movie showing the problem of mental illness 
1136," Almost pointless
"," Slow, pointless &amp; a waste of time.. the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time. How did it possibly have to take so long to tell the audience he's mentally unwell &amp; how surprising it was due to his mother, really?! As imaginative as a white sock.
Some nice camera work but otherwise over hyped rubbish. Heath Ledgers Joker was a thousand times better. "
1137," Neat But Nothing Special
"," Nothing makes this movie touches my 8-star list.<br/><br/>The cinematography is neat beautiful by the way, but I couldn't find any scene that supposedly will be remembered as a great shot. Sorry, I just couldn't find it.<br/><br/>The screenplay is having difficulty to built a grand climax. I mean, I wish they asserted a unique traumatic event life which built the Joker persona, but it was not there. Being bullied, losing mom, I think will only ended up in a regular villain, but you can see this kind of plot in many movies. What makes those experience special? Helloooo... you are building a super-villain here. The conflict in this story is not complicated enough to produce a Joker.<br/><br/>This is a great drama, not a super hero movie. Let's put it that way.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is a superior actor and he acted amazing, period.
He didn't bring that ""searching &amp; confused"" eyes that you find in people who have mental disorder. Ledger and Leno on the other hand displayed them, which perfectly represent a character with an awfully troubled mind. I understand, Ledger and Leno's Joker is a fully developed Joker, while Joaquin's played the Joker in the making, in his early stage of madness. The madness level between early Joker and older Joker might be different. Love Joaquin's acting. The screenplay man... ugh.<br/><br/>Cinematography is excellent. Consistent tonal and color grading, from start to end. I appreciate that it is showing a brighter Gotham than previous movies with Joker in it, nothing's wrong with that, it gives a different look of Gotham. Again I considered this more a drama movie than an action (super hero) movie, so the suspense should not be generated from the action scene but from the storytelling or conflicts. I wish I saw a bit chaotic camera motion to add suspense to character, but I only saw that in the train fight. I don't understand the shot in which Arthur Fleck sitting down on the side of his mom's hospital bed and taken from behind (only showing his side/back). What the heck? The back shot is supposed to be used to emphasize the subject/object in front of the character, which was Peggy Fleck lying still on the bed. What on earth interesting about it?!!! The shot taken from the opposite angle (from the bed towards Arthur Fleck) is stronger than that.<br/><br/>7-star is enough. I enjoy the movie. Tone down the hype guys, you are delusional to give this a 9, on par with The Godfather. "
1138," JP is great, can't say the rest about the rest.
"," Lackluster, boring, slow paced. The hype is exaggerated. The cinematography is overhyped because of a dark color theme and random angles. Unfortunately the angles always had joker in the center and the story was a try hard fail. A very predictable movie. "
1139," Don't believe the reviews
", Its just an ok movie.although Joaquin phoenix did give an award worthy performance.but the movie was not that great.don't believe the fanboys 
1140," Have people seen the film or just giving the trailer a 10?

1141," Are people rating this movie so high because it's just a tiny bit different from the usual comics?
"," I really have no idea why this film gets this kind of hype and rating. Coming in I was excited to see what was all the hype about but I left in despair and asking myself what's wrong with me for not liking this movie? Has it become a norm that everything that feels a little different automatically means we have an oscar on our hands? JP definitely deserves all the praise he's getting but I can't shake the feeling that it was all tried too hard to make it look way too serious and different while the plot didn't at all get the same treatment. I'm sorry, but this film doesn't live up to its expectations, it really doesn't. "
1142," Not entertaining at all!
"," This film was too long, too slow and too dark and unnecessarily violent. It was disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. I will give credit for the music selection.<br/><br/>Somebody give Joaquin Phoenix a hug and a Xanax. "
1143," The Pranker
"," Dude so this movie is what I would call good. Like there is so much plot in it and it gets intense which makes it intresesting and thot-provoking. Literally though two scantily clad females tried feeling me up during the film and I was like ""dude NOT cool save it for the battle bus"". But yeah anyway so Wakeen Feenix does a nice job playing the joker I mean the pranker I mean Arthur. He's got issues and he ain't afraid to show it. But yeah dude so I'm watching the movie and I was really just thinking the whole time like wow this movie is good. Like when Batman appears i thought oh my god this is like in Godzilla king of the monsters which I saw with the boys in imax on May 31st during the scene where the guy rides gkdzilla's titanic pecker. But yeah and also joker dances but I sat next to these two DUMB kids of dark descent The second time I viewed the movie and I had a throwdown with them cause they were laughing during my movie. Just goes to show how no one respects cinemenama anymore. But yeah dude the movie was trash no JK it was epic and I won't see it again. "
1144," TOTALLY over rated.
"," Imagine Taxi Driver with clown makeup. I've seen reviewers say you should watch Taxi Driver and King of Comedy first. I guess to put Joker in perspective. But this is a remake. Its a mentally disturbed guy's psychological demise, proviked by societal fecay, and consequential violent reaction. The end. Joachin Phoenix is more effeminate, and has some weird dance moves to demonstrate he is becoming his ""evolved self."" But otherwise, the other movies are better. "
1145," Just a random.movie
"," The joker went with Heith ledger
I didnt found anything special except the music and the direction...the cast of joakin is brilliant but the story is poor and details are missed<br/><br/>Nothing that brilliant except the 6 months of commercial advertising "
1146," Waste of time
", Felt like a 2 hour trailer waiting for the joker while a bozo smoked cigs and walked around doing fk all. Finally the last 5 minutes came and i thought wow we have a movie then it ended. Id rather spend my 20 on some face paint and some pints and actually enjoy my life. This will go down as one of the days where the long awaited hype was flushed down the toilet. Thank you for that. 
1147," OMG!!

1150," It's good, but it's not THAT good
",
1151," As much of a masterpiece as my butt!
"," These reviews claiming this movie to be a ""masterpiece"" etc etc, are absolutely ridiculous. You know the story before you walk in. Much of what happens you predict well in advance. Rather than entertain the audience, it relies on you being fascinated by the antics of a psychotic nutcase whilst trying to convince you that he is somehow heroic. "
1152," Missed Opportunity
",
1153," Inhuman and terrorising
"," Morally, I dislike the depiction of mental disturbances relating to violence.<br/><br/>Filmographically, this movie tries to ""terrorise"" the spectator. <br/><br/>Strip it from the terrorising narative and violence, the only thing left is a use of mental disturbances. "
1154," Overhyped movie
"," I just didn't get the hype about this movie. And why are we entertaining such violent movies. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be. No doubt the acting was good, but apart from that there's no story. It's dark depressing movie, about a guy who's dealing with bipolar disorder and killing everyone around him, including his Mother. What kind of negative message is it passing on to the society. "
1155," Great movie ever

1161," Joker
"," This movie make me feel admiringly, joker the Best movie ever "
1162," Logan isn't X-Men, Joker isn't a competator to the MCU. It's obvious.
"," Lesson: don't kick a person when they are down. Joker is not a 'comic book movie' and should not be ranked or compared to any DCEU or MCU films just as you would not compare ""Logan"", ""... 3,000 "". The richest and the people in charge of 'systems' in this world will never see it, but you should. "
1163," EMOTION.
"," I went to this movie 3 times, and I cried harder each time. It almost seems like Joaquin is under a spell, it was not acting, it was more than that. Joaquin showed so much emotion so much brilliance , he is absolutely crazy. Genius crazy, he deserves everything for this amazing performance that everyone will be talking about 10+ years later. The cinematography, the music, everything was unreal. Bless anyone that worked on this masterpiece "
1164," We Thought We Knew Everything About The Joker. We Were Simply Wrong
"," We just had to wait for Joaquin Phoenix to prove how arrogant we were. His performance is a delightful gift, which adds a new angle to the story of one of the best comic book villains ever created.
There will still be people disappointed just because they were waiting for another superheroes' movie, full of action and CGI. It's not about that. You don't need it here. Not with a good script, accurately directed, with a brilliant performance. Altogether makes us think about this villain in different ways, enjoying this retro style journey to the heart and brain of Joker. And I definitely think now we know much more about him. "

1167," A Perfect Origin Story - ""Do you know how I became Joker""
"," For long we wanted to see a origin story of Joker and here it is. Struggling comedian to Joker. Heath Ledger's joker deals on his vague origin story - ""Do you know how I got these scars"". Here is a origin story on - ""Do you know how I became Joker""
No high level vfx/cgi action scenes, almost no comedy - but this movie would keep you engaged for 2 hours. It will take a day to process the movie.<br/><br/>This movie deserves few oscars, if suicide squad can get why not Joker "
1168," Amazing.
"," First time writing here. Just watched the film in Korea.
Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best acting in years of cinema. And the storyline is super. Not a corny superhero film but rather a depiction of a psychological, social birth of a supervillain. Thumbs up. Will definitely recommend for yeara to come. "
1169," Terrible
"," I don't understand why this trash movie is being reviewed so well ! I saw this movie and this was a very depressing movie with an actor that was totally forcing the laugh of Joker and it was pathetic! Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger and Jared Leto did a much ....... better job with the role of Joker ! This 2019 Joker is just an extremely malnourished sorry excuse of Joker! I wish I never waisted my time watching this movie!! "
1170," DREADFUL! do not belief these fake reviews, it was horrendous.
"," AWFUL, BAD, TERRIBLE, NOT AT ALL ENTERTAINING! These were my initial thoughts throughout and immediately after watching this horrendous piece of propaganda. The audience score above is fake, PERIOD. I went with 6 friends and we all walked away with the same response that every other movie-watcher did that day: Why in the hell did I just waste my money and my time on this awful, dark, dreadful, not entertaining, piece of documentary-esque propaganda? I should have been prepared after Captain Marvel, another transparent attempt at pushing a false narrative as hard as humanly possible, but this was even worse. This movie wants to push this victimization crap as far as possible and have everyone sympathize and empathize so much with the poor Joker that we excuse his maniacal acts, even in murdering people for no good reason. Then we have his ""followers"" with their ""anti-fascism"" signs and a Thomas Payne (aka Trump) who they attempt to portray as this evil, wealthy businessman who goes into politics to keep out the ""Clowns who didn't make anything of their lives"". We are supposed to feel bad for Joker, meanwhile Joker is the one who shows up at Payne's house unannounced and then lures his son over before a security guard shows up only to have Joker batter said individual. Then Joker confronts Payne in a men's bathroom and, when he learns the truth of his own existence from Payne and simply doesn't accept it, Payne justifiably punches him in the nose and tells the lunatic to stay away from his son and his family, just as any father would/should do, but because Joker mistakenly believes Payne is his father, we are supposed to empathize with Joker and then view Payne's eventual murder as somehow appropriate or justified, just as Joker is exalted and cheered on by the masses shouting ""kill the rich""? Man, this was just awful and a thinly veiled effort to perpetuate this ""divide and conquer"" tactic that the radical left is playing like their lives depend on it. I, for one, wish I would not have wasted by time and money on this, but I will use my big a** mouth to make sure that everyone I come in contact with knows just how horrible this ""movie"" was/is. "
1171," A masterpiece that will live on
"," I don't need to say much here except it was beautiful, harrowing, thought provoking. Phoenix's acting was so profoundly deep and moving that I cried throughout. Insanely good. "
1172," Looks and acting= amazing, writing=lazy
"," Pros are obviously Joaquin is amazing and the direction is competent and it's beautiful and I actually liked a lot of the changes they've made Bc it's an origins story. Cinematography= excellent. I love the grittiness, the swearing, the constant chain smoking, the blood, the scene in the apt when he murders the guy with the knife and lets the little man go was great, the girlfriend thing being all in his head was great, joaquins dancing was great....<br/><br/>Cons= a lot of the writing was just lazy. He got away from murder way too easily (literally nobody was in the subway tunnel= needlessly convenient) the murders of 3 random punk kids starting a crazy movement of violence was unbelievable and stupid (they weren't important at all just 3 rich kids with no explanation?) although I liked the idea of Thomas Wayne being a bad guy pretty much every scene with him was stupid (the joker sneaks into the theatre so easily during the protests=stupid) the end where he gets murdered in the alley during the violence was really stupid and so lazy (the guy was running for mayor and had no body guards or anything= totally forced the Batman connection). I liked the themes but they were way too overt, like when he basically rants on tv about his mental illness before shooting Robert deniro... totally not like the joker at all... I don't care if it's supposed to be like that.. it could have been a lot more subtle and natural but wasn't... and finally, although it was gritty and dark... I feel like they were still way too careful and preachy... like I was expecting him to kill a lot more people and honestly hoping for it because that's what the joker does especially for his origin story! Everyone is obsessing over it and saying it's amazing but I really just think that it fell short on Way too many levels. Worth the watch and definitely more bold than most but could've been great and simply isn't. "
1173," Extremely overrated
"," I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read &amp; what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh. "
1174," Joaquin Phoenix is not an actor.. . No.., he is an ARTIST !
"," I was just speechless after watching Joker in the cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is a pure masterpiece with an oscarworthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His laugh, his antics... everything... was perfect.<br/><br/>One of the best movies i ever saw. "
1175," What i think about Joker?!
"," One of the best movie i've seen,Oscar to Joaquin Phoenix "
1176," Fantastic
"," I can only echo what other people have said about this film 100% awesome
Just watch it give it time and you want be disappointed "
1177," Don't believe the hype
"," This was such a disappointment! It was dragging on. And I was waiting for things to explode. I don't get the hype. Everybody is calling this a 'masterpiece', but nobody can tell me why it was such a masterpiece. If it was a movie about how a society creates a killer, then it was done very poorly. To me, it felt just like a large number of scenes without a real story. "
1178," They took a ride on a Taxi Driver
"," Acting is amazing, BUT the similarity with Taxi Driver (1976) is too obvious
It is the same in main theme, in plot, in acting, in cinematography even in music (cello theme)
Taxi Driver is much better because it was new, fresh/ It was in a right time. Joker is just a remake -they even do not deny it couse they took De Niro to pley one of the main parts
I wish Joaquin to win an Oscar. but it will be De Niro's too - for Travis "
1179," So true
"," This movie is so true, so raw and so painful. Brought me to tears. "
1180," I am not a fan
"," Lot's of people give it a 9 or a 10. I give it a 6.
For your info: When my opinion is usually 1 point better for a movie .
First I didn't think Todd Phillips should have used a Super Hero/Super Villain character for this role.
(from here on very minimal spoilers)
It's a bit like making Super man lazy and boring and not using his powers.
I would at least wanted Joker to ending up as a criminal master mind.
Even Thomas Wain was misrepresented in the movie. Further I heard there would be 'plot twists' in the movie - I think the two that were there were not really that interesting.
My advice, watch it on the small screen. I wish I spend my money and time on Rambo: Last Blood. "
1181," Finally competition for Ledger?
"," A symphonic love letter to fans of the infamous Batman antagonist, the Joker.<br/><br/>Don't expect this film to be a day in the life of the character however; as the films purpose it to show the *almost* gradually declining mental state of an extremely troubled Arthur Fleck as he sees his life crumbling around him as his eyes open to the dull and unforgiving environment of Gotham City.<br/><br/>Overall a great film with a stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. "
1182," Joker of the year
"," Considering I am not big on violence and the Batman series plus my boyfriend dragged me along to watch this, it was a great movie which portrayed Arthur developing into his persona as Joker. You feel for Arthur and empathise with his life story until his craziness goes out of control. Dark yet so relevant - spooked that I may know a few people like joker.... kidding. "
1183," This movie is fantastic!!

1185," A hard watch
", Phoenix does not deserve an Oscar for this. He deserves 2! Incredible performance from him. The film itself is a hard watch. Relentless misery for an hour before we see Joker 'fight back'. This film will affect you unless you have a swinging brick instead of a heart. 
1186," Masterpiece
", Totally blown away. One of the all time greats!<br/><br/>Takes art to a new level.

1188," Who's Laughing now
", This film is a total masterpiece Joaquin Phoenix acting is superb the hype of this movie is to be believed don't listen to those lefties they don't know what they're talking about 
1189," Commitment
"," Every little piece came together the right way to form a masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix is so committed you even forget it's him (actors' goal) his acting, his dancing, his laughter, the voice and the mannerisms that made him Arthur, you can see he gave more that 100% and was careful and respectful about it. The score is out of this world! Every piece fitting for every moment and situation. Todd P. Blew my mind this time! What a talent!!!! "
1190," Awesome, just fantastic!
"," Brilliant performance, awesome story, and a lil bit different end as we used to see than in an first version of Batman. Overall, I expect more than one Oscar for this masterpiece! "
1191," Breath of fresh air
"," Don't get me wrong i love marvel movies equally as much as dc movies but it's a nice refresher seeing a comic book movie take itself more seriously and not have a joke or one liner being said every other minute.
This movie can even be appreciated by non comic book movie lovers so if you're on the fence to see this movie due to growing tired of the usual formula i suggest giving this one a try.
Also don't listen to critics, you should watch this movie first and then formulate your own opinion as people will have different takes on this movie. "
1192," this is an insta-classic guys
", I don't like to give 10s... and wow this movie deserved it...everyone in the cinema was silent like in church... the movie is mesmerizing...won't spoiled it...just watch it in cinema while this makes history. 
1193," Joaquin Phoenix's Performance is a must see
"," So riveting, so addicting was the actors performance that despite there being NO action and very little story advancement after an hour into the film, I was still glued to the screen and sympathetic.
NOT a typical comic book movie; many fans of the genre will feel left out, as the film is essentially a rant against the (lack of) mental health treatment and offers scant Origin material.
The elder Wayne was portrayed in very bad light. I found this alternate interpretation clumsy, but not unexpected, as leftist Hollywood hasn't the guts to portray any white characters as good.
""Joker's"" origin in this version does not allow this character to display any of the genius typically associated with the character.
Joaquin Phoenix's realistic portrayal of mental illness, without campiness or empty sensationalism, will shed light on a societal ill and undoubtedly garner him Oscar nominations. "
1194," Overestimated (Not a 9 or 10/10 Film)
"," The first half was boring the second was a bit better. The actor did a good job, however overall average movie. Nothing special. "
1195," Masterpiece
", As kid we loved the hero's... As adult we understand the villains 
1196," expected an Okay movie, watched a masterpiece.
"," One of the best movies I have ever watched with Great acting, brilliant script and beautiful camera work. A real dive into Joker's story Which paints a picture we never really had and have always needed to understand his (joker's) why to the things he does. "
1197," ""A Critique of Society""-Really?
"," The positives of this film are undeniable. Phoenix's performance is fantastic and will be looked at for years to come. The rest of the cast is also great, though all in service of Phoenix. The cinematography, pacing, editing, and direction are all some of the beat of the year. But the main problem lies with the script. Every rave review I've read has talked about Joker as a critique of society. And it definitely tries to be, but fails to keep a cohesive message. A lot of the film revolves around Arthur Fleck and his mother's struggle with poverty and dealing with a system controlled by wealthy elitists that don't care about the downtrodden. This is seen through the ending of funding for Arthur's therapy and meditation. Thomas Wayne is used to symbolize this, which was an effective choice. The problem with this message is that it is undercut several times by people contributing to Arthur's problems for reasons other than the system. The film starts with a gang of going kids attacking Arthur and contributing to his eventual firing from work. But the kids have no clear motivation besides being mean, which doesn't connect at all to the idea of a broken system. When Arthur is attacked on the train by the Wayne executives, their acts are out of cruelty and don't really relate to their socioeconomic status. These and a few other instances throughout the movie really beg the question of whether the main theme of the film is about a system that fails to take care of the disadvantaged, or that all people are just mean. This results in a film that acts like it has lots of incredible societal commentary but never goes deep enough into anything to actually say much of anything. To quote NerdSync, ""The screenplay feels like it was written by a committee of edgy teens who totally think they're deep and interesting while never settling on a single, unifying idea or belief. Just 'people suck.'"" So no, don't believe the hype. It's a solid movie that begins to fall apart under closer examination. "
1198," Cried a little
"," Everyone that has ever bullied someone should see this movie just to understand what that behaviour does to people. Not everyone act like Joker but it sure hurts and breaks you inside. Beautiful beautiful movie, 10/10 "
1199," TOTALLY ELECTRIFYING !
"," MAGNATIC performance ! OUTSTANDING writing ! FINE directing !
JOKER is TRULY MAGNIFICENT !
this year OSCAR belongs to JOKER ! "
1200," Oh boy...
"," I'm a pretty big fan of film, so it actually makes me feel uncomfortable to say something like this...<br/><br/>That might've been the best movie I've ever seen. "
1201," Phoenix is great, movie has no legitimate connection to Batman franchise
"," Phoenix does a great job but, realistically besides the fact it takes place in Gotham and the minimal role of the Wayne family this movie has nothing to do with the Batman franchise. It's really a biopic of a crazy person who after learning certain things and experiencing certain events decides to stop resisting his crazy urges. Still a good must-see movie but, I think they're just coat-tailing off the notoriety of Batman to draw-in more audiences. They could literally change the name of this movie to ""The Clown"", place it in Detroit, and substitute Thomas Wayne for some other billionaire like Elon Musk and it wouldn't change the narrative at all. "
1202," Incredible performance from Joaquin Phoenix..can not fault this film at all , absolute Masterpiece
"," I have seen this film 4 times in less than a week; The trailers had me wanting to see this from over a month ago and sometimes when a film is hyped up, it falls flat as you expect too much. On this occaision Joaquin Phoenix delivers an acting masterclass and one the greatest performances of all time. The film is very dark and worth watching even if you are not into the typical Batman/Joker Genre. One fantastic aspect of this film is trying to work out how how much of the film is ""real"" or just Arthur's imagination 1, Obviously Arthurs initial interactions with Sophie &amp; No 2 , his inital interaction with Murray Franklin whilst in the audience..the rest is speculative 3 his interaction with a young Bruce at the Wayne family Home, 4 his meeting with Thomas Wayne at the theatre, 5 His appearance on the Murray Franklin show 6, The incident in the Police car after its hit by the ambulence.7, killing his mother in hopital (not one of the machines connected to her sounds an alarm that she is dead) did he smother her at home?..in fact was most of this film from Arthurs imagination whilst he is in the Asylum ...either way 10/10 and Joaquin Phoenix, amazing the Best Actor Oscar is yours "
1203," Just give Joaquin Phoenix the Oscar already!
"," I've never written a review on here before, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie floored me. By the end, I was simply in awe! If he doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor, I'll never watch the Oscars ever again. "
1204," Amazing performance
", Simply put Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as the Joker. 
1205," Dear academy awards, There's your guy.
"," Heath ledger is just proud up there am sure...breathtaking performance definitely one of the best for this decade
WHAT A MOVIE WHAT A PERFORMANCE! "
1206," Brilliant in every way
"," A masterpiece from start to finish. Brilliant acting, cinematography, music and effects. Phoenix easily deserves an oscar. The thrilling feeling you get from the start, amplified by the constant background music to match the character were amazing. 10/10, insane how well a comic book character was brought to life as if the whole story actually existed. "
1207," Movie of the year. Everything was so natural
", Omg ! I just saw it tonight and it was incredible. Best movie and best acting. I am waiting for the Oscar 
1208," Phoenix=Brilliant
"," Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. The hype surrounding it was overwhelming but it lived up to it. Brilliant case study surrounding Arthur Fleck's transition into the joker. What separates this from other superhero/villain movies is there is no suspension of disbelief. Every event and action could have plausibly taken place and that's what's so chilling about the movie. It really causes one to sit back and reflect on the nature of our society in creating the situations in the movie. Acting was brilliant, on par with Ledger. If you're inclined to watch any movie, I'd call this a must watch. "
1209," Awesome, mesmerising, masterclass in acting.
",
1210," The best in 2019 and of the best I've ever seen
"," A masterpiece, the best in 2019 and one of the best I've ever seen. Phoenix did his best and more, and he WILL get that Oscar once and for all. Arthur's character is sad and miserable, got nothing from life expect more sadness, he is maybe mad but in the and, when he says that to Murray is true and fair, some of us still have that life some of us had that life, and we all understand what suffers Arthur. He is a villain but he is also a hero in a way "
1211," Joker is gonna mess with your mind!
"," Easily became my favorite film of all time. When it was first announced that Joaquin Phoenix was going to play Joker a was a bit sceptical. But his performance was the best ever! Suited him perfectly with a great origin story movie for a villain. This is a story of how a man goes completely mad so if you expect to see full on savage Joker early on try to focus on Arthur Fleck and how his psychology changes with every punch he takes from society which is actually affects you as well. Todd Philips did a brilliant job, every shot of the film was breathtaking for me. Especially that first scene of Arthur with clown make up in the bathroom dancing. Definitely a must see film. "
1212," Just Perfect
"," Just go see it. Perfect acting, cinematography, sound and story. A beautiful piece of work worth seeing even if you don't like superhero films. "
1213," Masterpiece
", Masterpiece perfectly done really brought me into the film I can see why the film isn't for everyone but give this a chance it really is that good 
1214," GO SEE IT IN THEATERS
", This is the first movie I've ever seen twice in theaters. I usually don't like many movies because I usually don't find them engaging. I think this movie will go down in history and I can't stop thinking and talking about it! Everything about it was amazing!! 
1215," Awkwardly funny, but masterful
"," Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the joker is perfect, and exactly what I was hoping for. His theatrical prowess balanced seamlessly with his darker psychedelic side. The amount of time he has put into the character is obvious, from his physical clown like characteristics to his - almost frightening laughter which will be ringing in your head for days to come. This is not a superhero movie nor can you compare Phoenix to Heath Ledger. One thing for sure both their portals of the Joker are unique and individually immense. "
1216," Speechless
"," One of the best movies I ever seen, and the performance of Joaquin Phoenix it's one of the best ever. "
1217," This is it.
"," This is the one that we missed for a long time. Joaquin's Joker is far more realistic then the rest of others. Directing and writing was brilliant, and colors of course.
We see a real man, from the real life, not a fictional universe. We always know Joker as a 'explosive' identity and now, we know how-what is it about. Thank you for such a great experience. "
1218," OSCAR NEED JOAQUIN!
"," *What do you get when you cross paths with the mind of a mentally ill loner?
You get JOKER*<br/><br/>A thunderous and stimulating performance by Joaquin backed up by the visionary direction of Todd Philips.
Never in my wildest dreams did I picture Todd being so capable of bringing out such a diverse issue through the lens of his promising direction.
The soundtrack was on spot. The sounds spoke for the movie ar times.
Quite a refreshing experience.
Oscar needs Joaquin, rather than Joaquin needing one. His expressions were so accurate and enchanting.
Those who are caught in the dark gossamer of loneliness and despair would readily connect with this movie. "
1219," Knock Knock... whoes their... Joker's OSCAR
"," Wow, simply, Wow, after such a long time, so intense and outstanding acting. This is the best Joker ever... Years from now, it will be shown as a reference for new actors, the bar has been set, new levels achieved... well done J. Phoneix aka Joker... you rocked "
1220," A must watch movie in your lifetime..
", Just go and watch...u wont regret it...the love for villian is growing among audiences...First THANOS and now JOKER..! 
1221," Perfection
", Oscar-worthy performance by Mr. Phoenix. There's too much about this film that is perfect and unbelievable. You just need to watch it for yourself. 
1222," Amazing!!
"," This film is a masterpiece.
The actors are amazing and the film is beutifully scripted. "
1223," not just good but important.
", Nothing to do with the DC universe or even the joker. this movie is an insight into the mind of those so far down the social hierarchy that flipping the board is more rational than continuing to play.<br/><br/>This is why mass shooters happen and watching it makes you understand something most struggle to under normal circumstances.<br/><br/>when people say art has actual power its pieces like this that they are talking about 
1224," Joker - Portrayed by an almost unrecognisable Joaquin Phoenix
"," Very dark and gritty drama.<br/><br/>A very violent origin movie about mental illness.
A character study of the making of an evil monster.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix really delivers a dark, gritty 'Joker', it's a truly brilliant portrayal of an individual's miserable life, he is an individual only seeking human connection in a society that's in gradual decline. You may even find yourself empathising with the Joker?<br/><br/>This is very different from any other DC (or Marvel) movie that has come before. You may notice that no CGI is utilised throughout the 117 minutes, although none is necessary. The film is all about the atmosphere and an Oscar worthy performance from an almost unrecognisable Joaquin Phoenix, the Oscar board always likes extreme body transformations. "
1225," Very hard to top Heath Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix is close behind.
"," Set in the early 1980's, working clown Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix) a man who is heavily medicated, cause he is suffereing from mental illness, dreams of being a famous stand up comic, but his world begins crumble, will his sanity be lost, and his identity is only seen through his joker make up?<br/><br/><br/><br/>
I get this is a totally different Joker movie, very different from the DC universe movies we have seen already. Phoenix is quite chilling to watch, as you watch him lose his mind. The movie borrows heavily from such films like Taxi Driver(1976) and The King of Comedy(1983). Robert De Niro is pretty memorable has Murray Hamilton, a Johnny Carson like talk show host. Phoenix really delivers a great performance, you can tell he became the character when the camera was rolling. One problem I had they showed the death of Bruce Wayne's parents, which I felt was not needed, better to be hinted at it instead, and the end keeps dragging itself out, to the point you'll be telling yourself end already. But other than that a good film. "
1226," Absolutely touching, yet
"," I noticed a couple of downsides on the directors end, but that doesn't belittle any of Joaqin's beautiful masterpiece. "
1227," Brilliant
", One of the best comic book movies without being a comic book movie - brilliant character study - in the same style as taxi driver and king of comedy (a fitting 3 robert de niro list that) totally dark disturbing and deep with twists and turns and did that happen moments - defo one to watch multiple times 
1228," A view of the other side...
"," They got it. They've been able to show us darkness, madness, how a world can roll on people like Arthur. Great job, really. For 2 hours, i witnessed our world upside down... No one listens, no one cares and people just laugh. Until, you know... oh, then you will üòà "
1229," Acting like This OMG
"," I watched this movie just for joker acting, But J.Phoenix Proves above and beyond, This joker acting is more powerful, more beautiful, more accurate, more stylish, i love this joker acting very very very much, this is my fav acting "
1230," An Epic!
"," Slow, Intense, Beautifully Canvassed! One of my favorite films if not the favorite film ever! "
1231," Best joker player.
"," They gave all emotion correctly. As a Joker fan, he was the best Joker I've ever seen. "
1232," Fabulous
"," So read comments prior to going. While I like movies, I only reserve the best movies to see in an actual theater. Was aware there was little to no special effects. But all the super positive reviews had me interested. I will say that during the movie, I bought into the character of the Joker. Joaquin was responsible for making this character.. so believably believable! His ability, to become the Joker, left me in awe of his acting. I was laughing and wondered if I should have been at certain points. Joaquin guided me into that warped mind and you understood the why. Loved it. And as the other commenters, he deserves the highest achievement award they have to offer! If you are squeamish about the reality of what the mind can achieve when damaged by life or physical injure... this probably is not for you highly recommend! "
1233," Why you should absolutely see this movie
",
1234," Deep, dark, vivid and ambitious!
"," Joker is not only the best film of 2019, but one of the best in the last decade in every way possible. The score, the cinematography, Phillips' vision and Phoenix's performance amount to an awe inspiring piece of art. It can be controversial, complicated, contorted but it is unmissable. "
1235," THE HYPE IS REAL YALL
"," After the movie I couldn't stop smiling. Super satisfying ,an amazing take on one of the most iconic villain of all time and it should have been longer. "
1236," Couldn't believe what I saw!
"," So, where do I begin.. the absolute brilliance of this movie was beyond my expectations. Joaquin Phoenix has betrayed a DC main Villain in such a breathtaking performance that with every laugh from start to finish and every comment he makes, really makes you see that journey of craziness he goes on! In the end we see him talking to his therapist and saying she would not understand the joke he was laughing at in his head, personally I believe that the whole movie was in his head and the only true scene of reality was at the end. In conclusion this movie from start to finish is brilliant and a fantastic psychological thriller! Deserves an Oscar in every way. "
1237," Critics, give me a break please.
"," Lately, most movies have been adapted to be ""friendly"" for most viewers, lacking of depth, darkness and other ingredients. People and critics specified that movies (specially Disney-action movies) had to sacrifice some darkness and/or reality in order to make them user friendly for most audiences.
Then comes The Joker. It ignores any aspect of the ""audience friendly"" scheme and jumps into reality, darkness and all these aspects that we were so desperetely waiting for in other movies. This movie is graphic and crude in a lot of senses but thats what makes it so perfect. Todd Phillips didnt try to make it fit for all audiences. However, I've sene a lot of critics out there ripping into this film for being fuel for other things and for the strong content shown. Please decide what is it that you want because if you are looking for movies that ""fit"" most audiences, then you should be looking at a different franchise.
This is one of the best movies I've seen so far and I dont care what some critics are saying, you are definitely in for a treat if you decide to watch this movie. "
1238," Masterpiece
"," Only One word Oscar
What an movie best movie in decades 80s are back and baground sounds are lifting up the movie grate direction with cinematography Phoenix has given best performance yet. "
1239," Astonishing.
"," I went into this film with no expectations, struggling to believe anybody could top Heath Ledgers performance.<br/><br/>Mesmerising, dark, thrilling, twisted, raw. Phoenixs portrayal became the best I've ever seen and was such a believable insight into the life of the Joker.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy, time for an award! "
1240," AMAZING
"," Great moview and chilling performance. Well worth a watch, or 2...or 3...!!! "
1241," An amazing movie in all respects
"," I went into this with low expectations. Knowing it would not have Batman nor any action in it.... And wow, was I surprised and impressed. This movie had my full attention from start to finish.<br/><br/>Yes, it is dark and disturbing. But it is a well done dark and disturbing film. The performances were spot on all around.<br/><br/>The ONLY reason I give this movie 9 stars instead of 10 is for the simple fact that the Joker appears to be in his 40's here when he meets Bruce Wayne as a little boy. Meaning that the Joker will be an old fragile man by the time Bruce Wayne eventually grows up to become his arch rival Batman. Batman would have no problem taking him down.<br/><br/>So it will be interesting to see how they handle that in future installments. But THIS initial installment itself was brilliant. "
1242," The best c√≥mic movie ever Made !!!!
"," The best joker ever !!! Marvel you loose the movie battle
DC you have one of the best movies in the history !!!!! Joaqu√≠n Phoenix thanks for this amazing performance !!!!!! "
1243," Great film!
"," Todd Lewis really hit it on the head, with the inner message of this film. Amazing! "
1244," Phenomenal!
"," This movie wasn't what I expected, but I mean that in the best way possible. It was darker, grittier, and had a real feel to it that is unparalleled in comic book movies. The story was relevant to current times with themes of societal discord and mental health issues throughout. It made the Joker more than a character but a believable being that could live down the street, ride your bus, or work in your city. You travel with him down a dark hole until he reaches the point you'd expect in this scenario, yet still I found it unpredictable. This is a must see for any fan and truly the best Joker there has ever been. The story with minor changes could have even been taken out of Gotham with the main character being any person, and the movie would have still been outstanding in its own right. Do yourselves a favor and go see this movie! "
1245," A masterpiece with an important message
"," Joker. Where do I even begin. Never expected a comic book movie to talk about such serious issues that we as a human race face today. Mental illness, social economic disparity, social service funding being cut and how mental illness should be treated. And the best part about Joker is that it never takes a stance to position on these issues, all it does is show us what it's like and holds a mirror up. And that's it. It leaves so many things open ended for the audience to perceive. It's a dark, moody psychodrama which is elevated through Joaquin's performance, Lawrence sher's cinematography and Hildur gu√∞nad√≥ttir's haunting score. Tod Phillips also directed and wrote the film very well. The writing did drop in quality in some scenes during the third act which was one of my only flaws I had, but I'm not getting into spoilers. Watching Joker is an surreal, out of body experience. Watching some scenes for example the 'bathroom dance' is like being in a hypnotic trance. And these are just my thoughts on the film. Go watch joker. Support risky films like this that have something to say. "
1246," My film of the year!
"," Well, what can I say, most of the reviews are already saying it! This film is really strong &amp; very deep into the character, Joaquin plays the part much better than Nicholson &amp; Ledger in my opinion. I have always been an avid Batman fan growing up with Keaton back in 1989, loved Bales performance too. This however takes in a whole new approach following the Joker story. You will not be disappointed. I would definitely pay to see this all over again. 10/10 "
1247," Joker 11 out of 10 !!!!!!!
", The best film I've seen in a long time. Hats off to Phoenix the best joker by far dont get me wrong respect to heath ledger but Phoenix beats him. Really tells the story of how Arthur became joker and quite sad if I may say. Overall a spectacular film if I could give this a 11 out of 10 I would. 
1248," OMG
"," Something i haven't experienced so far, an extra outstanding acting and film as a whole is stunningly amazing work. "
1249," One of the best of all time
"," Joker is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made and it's most definitely my favorite movie of all time. The cinematography was lovely, the character development was beautifully done, Phoenix's performance was easily one of the best performances I have ever witnessed, and the film score was really engaging. The movie also depicts mental illness wonderfully. If you haven't watched it yet, you are surely missing out. Don't waste your time and go watch it. "
1250," Wow
"," What a film, definitely believe the hype and go watch this! "
1251," A lot of laughs & victory dances by Joaquin.
", This is a dark and twisted take on this iconic character. I love the approach Todd took with this character. No this is not a world building comic book film; this film is a character study on a tragic character that was abandoned from society at a young age and turned into a twisted psychopath. Joaquin is Arthur and is so lifelike I felt as if I was watching a found footage film. And yes I'm aware this is not a found footage film but you know what I mean. I love the twist in this film and how it dove deeper into his illness. We are viewing a disturbing individual that has many internal problems and I feel the cinematography compliments the world Arthur is viewing. You are viewing a colorfully dark picture which is what I feel Arthur is viewing daily. Arthur is fighting between colorful (positive) and dark (negative) emotions. There is not much plot in this film but the psychological illness this character brings fixes the lack of story. The ending does go on a little too long but nevertheless it just adds to this iconic character! 
1252," You wouldn't get it.
", Social Worker: Is something funny?<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck: I just thought of a funny joke!<br/><br/>Social Worker: Do you mind telling it?<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck: ...You wouldn't get it. 
1253," Joaquin is the best actor right now.
"," The best live action joker by far, the plot is designed form him to shine and Joaquin gives proves that he is probably the best actor alive. "
1254," If you're bored of your bog standard ""superhero movies"", WATCH THIS AMAZING FILM
"," This film is nothing but a cinematic masterpiece. Very depressing, artsy and gritty. You feel like you're being dragged through the downward spiral of his life. You feel the emotions he's going though and you cringe and feel uncomfortable at almost every turn. The gore/action isn't overwhelming...it's done in just the right places, making it even more shocking. As someone who is bored of ""superhero movies"" and their similar storyline and hour or so of fighting...this my friends is a breath of beautiful fresh air. Joaquin Phoenix...GIVE THE MAN AN AWARD...He is a living and breathing work of art. I now understand why this film got a standing ovation. It's the film of the year, if not the best film of all time. "
1255," A cinematic masterpiece...
"," I don't know how any critic could rate this movie as bad. I've read more bad reviews than good. Did they see a different movie to me? I was entranced. The incredible cinematography combined with fantastic music and a nuanced script made it a very good movie, but... The performance by Phoenix... Well that just elevated a great movie into a masterpiece of cinema. This movie is the reason I love movies. The richness of character combined with its mystery of humanity mixed with fantastic imagery and direction. Well I can't stop thinking how good this was. If you love cimema, watch this. It's simply brilliant... "
1256," Dark, Deep, Moving, and a Psychological Masterpiece
"," As a student of psychology, Joker has found a way to see the slow decay of a individual suffering from psychosis, psychotic tendencies, narcissism, the need to belong, and finding pleasure in the darkest of places.
This movie isn't for everyone. It is very dark. There isn't a happy ending. Yet the acting and story-line can be appreciated for the moving story it portrays. As the Joker portrays one with a severe mental illness, this movie at least offers insight on the real struggles that exist in those with mental health problems, while still offering a masterful way to depict the origin story of the world's greatest super villain.
It's a film that has a story so unique that you can't look away, a story whose acting is only seen in the greatest films of all time. It is unlike any other film I can remember. "
1257," How some criminals are made!
"," The movie is sad and depressing for sure. However, it shows how the poor and mentally ill can be turned into criminals. In addition, shows how capitalism in poor societies can lead to a dangerous society thats full of villians. "
1258," The Great Formula of a good 'Based' Comic Movie!
"," Hopefully with the success that Joker is having, farting DC that his characters do not work with the formula of Marvel, what they did with Joker is totally the opposite of any blockbuster comics movie, bloody, explicitly dark violence. And all that makes it great, in addition to the direction of photography and color palettes, the excellent interpretation of Joaquin Phoenix and the script. "
1259," A Surprisingly Grounded & Interesting film-- yet not essential Joker. 8.7
"," Overall Great movie!!! (writing, direction, acting)
I am excited to see if it's strength raises the bar for newer releases.
It's plot sings the blues of the jokers story and does so with nostalgic aesthetics- combining ""Taxi driver"" psycology with a ""King of Comedy"" theme (Coincidently two movies starring De Niro &amp; directed by Scorsese).
The emphasis was heavy on the mental illness and misfortunes of Arthur Fleck but unexplored were the entertaining/ musicality traits of a joker.
The playfulness that was expressed through the character seemed more-so of Joaquin Phoenix and less in the spirit of Joker.
Throughout the movie the Joker is portrayed as self conscious and the resolution/ climaxed rebellion is an out-cry from that- not so much on his real connection to Gotham or a villainous reign.
That said I don't see this Joker bright enough to be an infamous, self sustaining, street-wise villain. "
1260," Magnificent
"," This is raw meterial, that really plays with you emotions and morality. It litteraly give you the creeps. I find it Hard to describe it, so very disturbing yet so fascinating. Joaquin is absolutely amazing, never have i ever believed a caracter a much as I did when i watched him as The Joker. So convincing and comepelling just give him an Oscar allready. "
1261," Excellent! Dark, gritty and pleasantly uncomfortable movie.
"," You'll laugh uncomfortably, Just like Joker!
What a brilliant movie! Very well made dark Interpretation of mental illness. Cinematography, film score and direction are brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix Does an outstanding performance. Definitely Oscar worth. "
1262," Temper your expectations!
"," If you come into this movie with MCU expectations this will be a difficult watch for you. There's a certain level of fantasy that has been excepted as norm in modern day comic book films. Joker flips that on its head. It's real, and I mean really real! It deals with some very deep themes that are uncomfortable to deal with but I think that's the point, it's a mirror of our society. This is not some special effects laden anti-hero flick, rather, this is a character study of the devolution of a man that society has failed on every level. Be prepared. "
1263," Wow. Joker was executed perfectly
"," If there was a way to tell a story of a mad man who is the mortal enemy of Gotham's Dark Knight... This was it.
How Joker came about, how the world molded him to becoming THE JOKER of Gotham.. This love executed the story well. Joaquin Phoenix was and is the perfect actor for this particular Joker. Truly marvellous acting. Smart, creative plot. Glorious movie. Thank you!!!! "
1264," The Joker Effect
"," First of all I must say, this film can be understood as a basic mathematic equation for the fanatics of Martin Scorsese. Adding The King of Comedy + Taxi Driver + Cape Fear, and multiplying it all to a fully creative screenplay on a previously existing character = Joker. I believe I've never witnessed such an authentic way of stealing the show as Joaquin Phoenix's performance under Todd Philipps direction. Joaquin is easily one of the best actors of his generation. He chews the character, eats it, spits it, then chews it again. He fully understand the complexities of the villain and portrays it in an utterly unique manner. This joker should not be compared with Ledger's (under Nolan). They are totally different phases of a character that was developed in two completely distinct stories and contexts. I can't say Phoenix surprised me, but that's not a bad thing. In fact, I have such an awareness of his abilities I knew he would nail it right on the spot. He drives the story in a fantastic way. You laugh, even when you should'nt, which is basically, the primary characteristic of Fleck. Senses of fear, danger and chaos are properly driven and exploited. I should say I'm definitively surprised by Philipps's approach. Based on his previous work such as the ""Hangover"" trilogy and other films such as War Dogs, I must say he really did his best on this flick. Without a doubt, this is his peak so far and I trust he'll only work to surpass such a movie. Within other aspects, the use of colour is sublime, a vintage-tone and an impressive wardrobe selection for the man himself, Arthur. Photography is truly magnificent. Music is incredibly reliable for the themes portrayed. The dark and gloomy cello brings the film a truly magnificent aspect to define the traumatic personality and experiencies the joker lives. On other aspects, secondary characters such as Penny, Murray, Sophie and Arthur's work partners are really important for sustaining the story. Subplots are unique and the main storyline was accurate enough to explain in a vivid manner the metamorphosis of Fleck, as well as defying on a smaller scale the origins of the hero, Batman. Length of the film is perfectly measured, pacing is precise and it really goes along fast. You won't even realize 2 hours have past and then, you'll know what I mean. Overall, I believe Phoenix, Philipps and the score are the aspects that influenced me with such a positive response. Definitively a must watch, and surely, an Academy contender for the three characteristics I believe are under the spotlight; Main Actor, Best Director/Script and Best Original Score (although there are musical pieces which were previously written). In conclusion, flaws are not something I'd relate with this film. 10/10 for me. "
1265," Breathtaking performance
", Overall a great movie with an amazing direction but what really need to be mentioned is the brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix 
1266," Woooow
"," Never would I had thought I'd sympathize and even feel sorry for the man that would become the joker. Heartbreaking, unsettling, disturbing, pity, remorse. I felt all that throughout the film as I kept rooting for Arthur to find happiness even if I knew the end result. You don't need to be a batman or comic fan to appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>And forget the media for focusing so much on how this ""glorifies"" violence. It wasn't even that violent. There are bigger issues it raises like rich vs poor, mental/physical abuse, and of course, mental illness. I left thinking on all those, in fact feeling more sympathetic for those like Arthur. And I'm sure there are ppl out there struggling like him, even without the mental baggage. The media should be praising this film. "
1267," Movie of the century
", Not the movie of the year but the movie of the century 
1268," IT'S NO JOKE.
"," The best thing about this movie is how we see the world through Arther Fleck's eyes (who will transform psychologically to become Joker) and not through a narrator's perspective. That alone makes this movie so unique coz it's the first time that is done with a character that is so villainous and so popular like Joker.
No need to speak about how great Joaquin Phoenix's performance is. It's an Oscar worthy in my opinion. It's so hard - if not impossible to top him this year.
The director did a tremendous job to deliver the darkness and grittiness of Gotham City in a deep touching way. That makes you get sucked into that world. Photography is another spectacular aspect of this movie.
I'd give it more than 10 üåü s if that was an option. "
1269," Joker is a masterpiece
"," Intense, unnerving film that caused real dialogue between myself and the person I saw the film with. Don't quite understand the controversy surrounding it and I admit it won't be a film that everyone will love (has a pace that some may consider slow). Really interesting character study that Phoenix absolutely nails. I understand it won't happen, but would love to see more Gotham villains get this type of standalone origin film treatment. Love that Gotham was utilized as more than just the backdrop. "

"," This film is so multi layered. 1st off it's amazing. The acting is incredible. Joaquin Phoenix is really tremendous in this role. You watch him slowly ratchet up his performance as the movie goes along and you watch his character slip slowly into madness and transform into The Joker. This movie is definitely a slow build. But, if you stick with it and watch him change as the movie goes on, there is plenty to keep you watching. The biggest surprise for me is Todd Phillips. If you told me the guy who directed The Hangover movies could direct something so artistic and gritty, I would have told you you're crazy. The direction is really top notch. Go see this movie. It's dark, it's a bit slow, and at times it's a bit disturbing, but it is REALLY compelling. 9.5 out of 10 "

I definitely recommend this movie.Besides I expect JOKER would obtain several OSCAR AWARDS!!!Especially the best actor!!

1287," A MASTERPIECE
"," This is the movie of the year if not the decade! A masterful directing from Todd Phillips, the photography, the music are also outstanding.
But what is breathtaking, is Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. He has been an outstanding actor worth at least an Oscar already (for The Gladiator, The Master, Inherent Vice and so on). But his Joker will be taught in film schools. You don't see such a performance too often or never see one.
On the other hand, about the film, it's a standalone movie but if you know the Batman Universe you understand small details better.
If you want to see one film this year this should be the one (and The Irishman, of course :-) ). "

This movie is at different times, genuinely disturbing, puzzling, electrifying, and unpredictable as to what will happen next. Excellent writing &amp; cinematography, which would have gone to waste if not for the incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. If you love to see what the art of acting is about, go see this movie.

"," This movie is soo good with brilliant acting, music and cinematography... This movie is a perfect piece of work. First 20 minutes alone deserves an Oscar. "
1313," Just, great!
"," Joaquin Phoenix has an outstanding performance! Oscar should come to him this year. Great movie, dramatic and haunting development of a well known character, a psychological overview of an ""unseen"" ill man in a crazy society and the consequences that comes from this. A must see definitely! There is sadness, you'll want to cry for him, for the Joker, for in the end he could be anyone of us. "
1314," Amazing
"," Amazing, Joaquin Phoenix would have to be one of the finest actors of this generation. One of his finest roles, the movie itself was substantial in script, cinematography and support. This movie I will be thinking about a lot and one of the rare ones I will be seeing again. "
1315," Smile
", This right here is cinematic gold. The cinematography is amazing. The soundtrack is spectacular. Joaquin Phoenix is crazy good; his performance keeps the movie together. The supporting cast is also great. This is how movies should be made. Character driven stories are so much better than 300$ million CG effects. Thanks WB for finally listening to the fans. 
1316," critics are harsh for personal reasons (calling out woke culture)
"," I can't trust the critics anymore. They showed everybody how bias, and not professional they are. The movie is a great masterpiece. The movie ended and I hoped I could see it again right after just so I can continue with the beautiful feeling Joaquin Phoenix gave us with his acting. You will feel bad for Joker and then you will be scared of him. This is what a true movie feels like. I loved every single frame of this great creation! "
1317," Amazing !
"," Simply amazing and Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this r√¥le. Go to see it, you will not regret it. Best movie of 2019 so far ! "
1318," GLORIOUS

1323," Joaquin Deserves An Oscar For His Brilliant Performance
"," Heath Ledger raised the bar with his Joker performance, but I knew that if anyone could nail this role it would be Joaquin Phoenix.
I saw Joker and I absolutely loved it! This movie does not have all the action packed scenes we are use to seeing, it focuses more on character and the genesis of the Joker.
Don't walk into the theater expecting and comparing him to Heath Ledger's performance, expect to see Joaquin Phoenix giving an Oscar worthy performance with his masterful take on it.
In yo face Marvel! As much as I enjoy the Marvel universe, in my personal opinion none of those actors can pull off a performance like Joaquin in Joker.
This movie proves that you don't need all the syfy and special effects to make a movie great, it has solid acting by a brilliant actor.
Doesn't look like he would do another one but it would be awesome if he did.
I love Phoenix and Deniro's chemistry together.
Such a great film, one that definitely deserves to receive several nominations and accolades. "
1324," Get ready Oscar
", I saw an Oscar performance in a Oscar winning like movie 
1325," Truly a masterpiece üëå
", It offers psychological study rather than a superhero story.<br/><br/>Great Acting üî•from Joaquin Phoenix 
1326," Amazing.
", This film was incredible. Joaquin was super in this film. This role was perfect for him. Oscar worthy FTW! 
1327," Genius
"," What a great movie. Joaquin Phoenix performance was beautiful. The greatest villain in history deserved this performance. It's so sad, but it is a movie that occurs in the 70s with today's society. The photography was great, but a lot of close ups. "
1328," Brilliant
"," Joaquin Phoenix was mesmerising I couldn't take my eyes off of him he definitely deserves the Oscar for this character. It was extremely hard to watch in parts as the treatment of his character was so sad, but the film was fantastic. "
1329," A Great Movie !
"," Phoenix really did this role with a new style.
It's REALLY PERFECT... Pheonix roll is CRAZY!
I am a Joker top fan and I really loved it.
The plot is amazing, and most importantly the message!
Now Ledger is a thing and Pheonix is another. Everyone of them has his own style and taste. We can't compare them they're both great. "
1330," Sublime!
"," Pure cinema in it's best way. This movie is based on highclass acting, no visible use of tasteless cgi effects, a well writen story line and plot. One word for this movie: sublime. "
1331," A Masterpiece
"," I had great expectations for the movie, but they were exceeded. This movie is a true masterpiece. From the A+ acting of Phoenix to the cinematography and the music, this movie got it all right. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this tragic and this intimidating. It's full of surprises yet you feel as you could predict Arthur Flecks next steps. It makes you want to cry and give him a hug but at the same time he's the kind of person you would try to avoid. Contrary to many reviews I do not think it glamorizes mental illnesses, on the contrary, it addresses them in a different, more realistic way. Anyone who suffered from mental health issues knows how hard it feels to act ""normal"" and how people judge you for your behavior. Neither do I think does the movie glorify violence, people who think so have clearly never seen any action movies. Joaquin Phoenix is playing the role of his life in this movie and finally gets the recognition he deserves. Overall a genius movie but not made for the faint-hearted. "
1332," 2019 Best Movie of the Year!
"," This ain't an action movie or a super hero movie either. Do not expect Heath Ledger to act in this. Rest In Peace to the best Joker in the entire world. Joaquin Phoenix portrays as Arthur Fleck, suffering from a mental disorder and truly ridicule by the terror of Gotham City society. Seeing what he goes through in his life can really bring a man down to madness. Yes, the key word is madness! It's a prequel to the Dark Knight. In this movie we slowly seeing Arthur become Joker. Don't want to spoil it, because this is a character development movie. I will give Joaquin Phoenix credit as he becomes iconic clown prince of crime. Joker is the best movie of the year! "
1333," Joaquin Phoenix IS the Joker!
"," Regardless of what some of those ""artsy"" film critics might say. This film is an absolute gem. Joaquin Phoenix in my personal opinion SURPASSED the late great Heath Ledger as the clown prince of crime. Believe me, I was pro Ledger for years upon years &amp; even went into this film believing that Phoenix wouldn't even come close to matching Ledger's performance but man, I was wrong on so many counts. Todd Phillips did a PHENOMENAL job with the direction of the film. Phillips was definitely not the guy you would have expected to make a such a dark, aggressive &amp; disturbing film but he sure outdid himself. If both Phoenix &amp; Phillips don't receive an Academy award for this film, everyone should riot in clown masks at the Oscars. "
1334," Movie of the year.
"," The review title says it all. Joker is the movie of the year. Joaquin Phoenix was beyond incredible. Go see it, go see it again, maybe even a third time or more if you care to (which trust me you will want to.) "
1335," Fantastic Movie
", 10 is an understatement for this movie. Phoenix is unbelievable. The storyline and sets are fantastic. I will see it again. Much much better than any of the Batman movies. 
1336," Best history & actor to make a master piece!!
"," This is the best c√≥mic movie adaptation of all time! Is a piece of art, from the beginning to the end! I was going to this movie with a big expectation and at the same time worry because maybe I will be satisfied or disappointed, but was a lot better than I was expected!! It's a different way to show a history even we know what is about!! The writer and the actor make a master piece!! "
1337," Wow.
"," Absolutely phenomenal. One of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have ever seen. It was incredibly disturbing but it all had a purpose, nothing was gratuitous for the sake of it. I have never audibly gasped so loudly in a movie than I did here, so many absolutely sick and shocking scenes that leave such an impact. Joaquin deserves awards. "
1338," A fantastic movie, chilling
", Joaquin Phoenix portrayed the growth and development of Joker in an incredibly believable progression. I loved every minute of this movie. I hooe we get to see Joaquin in this role again. Truly outstanding performance. 
1339," Master piece
", Not much can be said . Just Master piece.great performance and music. Great story line . And above all great laugh:)) 
1340," Favourite film of all time!
"," It is the perfect combination between Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""King of Comedy"", however ""Joker"" is a unique and original character study masterpiece! Todd Phillips did a marvelous job with the character, origin story, and film!
About Joaquin's interpretation i can't say it is the best or my favourite of all time, because that would mean to compare it to other interpretations, and that would be a huge insult for Joaquin Phoenix! What he did in this film is absolutely uncomparable!! No award can express the real value of this interpretation! "
1341," Heavy movie
"," Reality might be even darker. Gotham people get their joker. But we vote got our president, who is one of Thomas Wayne. All these remind me communism vs capitalism. "
1342," Everything I didn't expect
", Amazing film with a great character development that will leave you in shock and awe. This film will challenge you on every emotional level. 
1343," Oscar deserving
"," Rarely do you come across movies which hits the perfect chords on all aspects. This is that movie.
Acting is absolutely phenomenal, direction top notch. But the icing on this wonderful and tasteful cake would have to be the background score. "
1344," Outstanding
"," I've never seen a movie with such depiction of life. I truly felt the character, what he was feeling. Outstanding acting by Joaquin, he portrayed the true essence of the character and created an examplary joker.
It's true what they say: All it takes is a one bad day "
1345," Outstanding..
"," The shooting, the music, the story telling and the great Joaquin Pheonix.. just ahhh "
1346," We Live in A Society
"," The culmination of the world's atrocities and ignorance of what we've done to the modern man. A gut wrenching, beautifully artistic, and poignant work. The cinematography, the acting, the score, every detail of this film is put together with such care and purpose that it will creep itself into your mind until it's there forever. Cinema needed this. "
1347," Truly haunting
", Wow. This movie was truly disturbing and marvelous at the same time. Mr. Phoenix you are truly the best joker ever. Best performance ever given in a movie. I was just in awe when the movie ended. 
1348," Darkly beautiful
"," There's a reason why there are so many 10 star reviews. Joker is a perfect film. Beautifully shot, tragic, funny at times and dark. Joaquin Phoenix delivers per usual and is mesmerizing to watch. Congrats to Todd Phillips and the rest of the crew for this masterpieceü§°üôèüèª "
1349," A fresh perspective
"," What I love about this version of the joker is he doesn't fall into the chemicals and fight Batman. He is simply a man who is disregarded and abused by society. His mother emotionally abused him to the point where he believed he has a mental illness. He is also mocked by the upperclass society and keeps everyone feeling like they will be the next one to die. I don't care if this movie gets mixed or bad reviews. The film tracks a man's decent into madness in spectacular fashion, with a fully committed Joaquin Phoenix leading the charge. "
1350," The reality is what's terrifying... I think
"," It was heavy, spent most of the time with my hand over my mouth, and thinking about what I think about this movie. Seen so many disturbing stuff in films, people getting eaten alive in the worst ways by zombies, cannibalism, skinning, etc. yet this movie made someone getting shot and someone getting stabbed the maybe most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed. I have deduced because it was so real. The insanity expressed was so real, it left me so uncomfortable. Felt like DC let out their pent up rage towards Marvel... kinda kidding. But basically this movie deserves the revolutionary hype it's getting, and this is coming from someone who was skeptical of all the praise. "
1351," Amazing
"," I never write reviews, this may actually be the first time I have written one. I thought that the movie was brilliant. The acting was perfect and the psychological aspect of the film was beyond any expectations I had. "
1352," The perfect film. The Joker is a true hero.
", I have always self identified with the joker and this movie only confirms things for me. 
1353," Just....wow!!!!
",
1354," An outstanding movie!
"," Honestly, I do not write reviews as I think it is a waste of time... but this movie - is ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES - I have ever seen, I have seen LOTS of movies in my life. This movie takes the 1st place as you get to see how a depressed and sad man let down by society goes ""crazy"" because of not been taking seriously in his entire life. Also, the part in the movie were Arthur (Joaquin) laugh without his will is a masterpiece of act by Joaquin, you will get emotionally touched by the scene. Hands down, ""One of the best movies in history"". "
1355," Great role of Phoenix
", A good movie for a Saturday night. The line up is well chosen. Actors are great. 
1356," Wow. Just wow!
"," I went to the cinema to see this movie today. What an amazing movie. I'm speechless. It's dark, very dark. The music is beautiful and Joaquin Phoenix is acting fantastic!! Wow! I love this movie so much! "
1357," Taxi Driver meets King of Comedy
"," Deniro being the central character of both of the above movies makes his role in Joker a brilliant choice! I don't write movie reviews, so I apologize for the brevity of this one. Basically, in a time where movies struggle to be a 6 out of 10, Joker nails it with a 10!! Never a boring moment. "
1358," Amazing and rare masterpiece
"," I'm still in the theater. Creadits are rolling. Don't want to include any spoilers, but I will definitely come back to watch again and again as long as it's on the big screen. Incredible performance by Phoenix, thought provoking, emotional and moving. Absolute pleasure "
1359," Interesting how the mainstream media has had such a negative response to this
"," I thought this was an incredible movie, and I'm shocked that mainstream reviews have been so negative. I personally think it's because of the social commentary that's so pervasive throughout it. I read one review from NBC I think that said this movie had no point or substance, which of course anyone who's watched it would know is total b.s. They aren't stupid; they know that this was a critique of the elite (among other things). You had sympathy for him, while still being incredibly uncomfortable watching it.
This movie was very intense and disturbing. There was nothing entertaining about it. It kept me up most of the night. Everything about it was well-done, and it's unfortunate it isn't getting the response it should from film critics, but again, I think we all know why that is.
Also, I thought the emphasis on mental illness was very profound. I liked the part where he wrote down something like ""Why is it that when you have a mental illness people expect you to behave as if you don't?"" "
1360," Joker is a result of bad policies of our world.
"," This movie is a message for us don't push any human to his max. Who created joker is us. We push him to his max , what he get in his life only bad treatment after we give him tools ,then he being creative criminal "
1361," Dark and Depressing
", Here's The Joker we've been waiting for and it is best portrayal of the character and the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is mindblowing it gives goosebumps just by his facial expressions. 
1362," Masterpiece
"," I've made this account today just to rate this film a straight 10/10.
Unbelievable say no more. "
1363," I didn't want it to finish
"," This movie is and will be an Icon for a long long time. It awaken my emotions in a way that you don't even feel the surroundings..
absolute a masterpiece love it. It should get all the oscars<br/><br/>PS the actor brett ( Batmans Dad ) is the same actor who played the congressman in dark knight rises :(
Should have picked someone else "
1364," masterpiece, one of (if not) the best DC movie.
", If you think you are gonna see a superhero themed movie you are wrong. What the movie is about is that it tells how someone can go crazy true the hard society. I think Phoenix is a real good actor who fits perfectly for this role. This is one of my favorite movies ever. 
1365," Incredible masterpiece of filmmaking
", Please watch this film to make up your own mind and don't read the critics reviews 
1366," Elementary
"," This movie is VERY strong and shake your world with an elementary power. It IS violent but this is a story, a movie and gives you a perspective deeply on something what you could never really seen before.
First movie in this year!! which is something unusual, cathartic, deep, thanks for Joaquin Phoenix! I really felt that guy and I will never forget this acting!
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. "
1367," A movie for the history.
"," Despite rotten tomatoes and metacritic ratings.
This movie show why warner bros still above desney. "
1368," Simply BRILLIANT.
"," Finally, justice and a more than worthy replacement to Nolan's and Ledger's Joker (character) in The Dark Knight. I think that endorsement alone is enough to get most of you to watch this film.<br/><br/>What an amazing movie and let me tell you that to me there was very few comedic and outright funny moments. I found the movie for the most part to be serious and hauntingly sad.<br/><br/>What a performance and character portrayal by Mr. Joaquin Phoenix. WOW. "
1369," People need to stop comparing to Heath Ledger. Joaquin gave a fantastic performance. Period.
"," I dont understand why do people have this urge to compare the 2 jokers. Todd phillips shows us the slow descent of a loner into madness, whereas Nolan's Joker show the level of menace Joker could go to. Both are fantastic, but when the fools start to compare, they are not comparing apples to apples. Ofcourse Joaquin's role as Joker wont be as crazy, menacing &amp; fear inducing as Heath Ledger's coz he is still coming to terms with being Joker. Anyways, with almost 95% of the screentime for one character alone, this movie was fantastic &amp; lived up to my expectation of Joker. Some people would also be cheesed about the fact that there is a hugeee departure from the comic book, but i respect Todd's vision. "
1370," Top 5
"," At least top 5 one of the best movies ever made.
You are going to be really really satisfied "
1371," A HELL OF A GOOD MOVIE!
"," Yesterday I think I watched history,best movie EVER for a comic book villain.The performances were all amazing especially the oscar worthy Joaquin (I put a bet with my girl that he will win the oscar)!! AAAAAMAZING!!! "
1372," Joker a beautiful tale hahahahahahhahahhahahahahahheeee
"," Gritty, dirty, sad, poetic and quite brilliant the build up of a maniac its mesmerizing to an extent, can you believe Joker has a movie on its own, that should be the punchline to one of his jokes. Sorry it didn't turn into a full blown, I hate the president movie like everything else that's coming out this days. Watch it there's no action just disturbing images of pure rage and incredible acting compose by the amazing score of music. Joker is Phoenix but the music its also Joker my god it's so great how well that blends from beginning to the very end. Gotham looks incredibly looks real and it felt real, this movie can stand on its own and DC can go suck it please let this be the route to more of this artistic masterpieces. "
1373," Movie of a lifetime
", The movie is so good that you might not be willing to leave the theatre even after the movie is finished. Its even darker than the dark Knight. Pls go and watch it because you owe it to yourself 
1374," Fantastic movie, I felt so much touched by the topic of depression, loneliness....
"," I saw it yesterday evening with my younger brother. That was the best quality screen possible in my city, which of course costs a lot compared to regular screens.
BUT, I already bought a ticket for tonight's show too in the same screen!
That was just an amazing movie! I barely gave any 10 stars for movies, but this one is a solid 10! "
1375," BRILLIANT!
"," Firstly, ignore some of the media critics strange negative agenda/reviews. This movie is superb! Phoenix is one of the best character actors there is! He definitely is the most immersive actor out there. Beautiful cinematography. Dark and foboding. In a city where an elitist minority are looking down on the poor suffering majority; pushing them to the edge with Joker ultimately as their king! It's not your twee little crowd pleaser movie. Thank goodness. More like this please! If there aren't Oscars handed out on this one you just known they're definitely not worth having in the first place! "
1376," Masterful.
", Masterful. Maybe one of the only real films in 20 years. Fight club. Might have been the last true film of my generation. This might be the first true film of this generation.<br/><br/>The idiots will hate it. They don't like to think. It's not a movie fir sensitive people. Trigger warning losers. You are unhappy because of yourself.<br/><br/>I truly hope this is the new avant-garde we need more real art. 
1377," Give this man an Oscar
"," Best acting I have seen in awhile. If he doesn't get an Oscar, I'm not sure why they even exist. "
1378," PHENOMENAL!
", Joaquin's masterpiece! I hate how people are purposely giving it a 1-star rating to bring it down. Joaquin was incredible. Nailed the laugh! 
1379," Two Oscars?
"," Can two different actors earn an Oscar for playing the same character? I mean has that happened before? If not, then it's about to. Phoenix isn't in this movie.. you're watching the Joker. It has the same vibe as Taxi Driver. A slow burn look into the mind of a mentally demented ""good"" guy. "
1380," Best Movie
", Best Movie. Best content. Should definitely win the Oscars 
1381," The greatest origin story so far
"," I will say this: WOW. This film is a perfect case study about the breakup of the personality of a lonely man with psychological problems. This is not a movie about super heroes and if someone goes to see it with such attitude then they will be disappointed. The action revolves very slowly, slower than in a Hitchcock film. But oh boy ... I watched Phoenix's creation with a flush on my face. For me, the biggest plus (ATTENTION SPOILER) is that the film is set in our reality of the eatly 80s (SPOILER END) and that the characters are ordinary people, who struggle with the hardships of everyday life and loneliness despite the fact that they exist side by side of one another. You can literally identify with them, because they are struggling with the same adversities as each of us every single day. The actors were perfectly cast and matched to the roles and were able to portray the respective characters at a top drawer level, but I think that especially Hoaquin did a great job and matched the creation of Heath Ledger's Joker (I deliberately do not write that he played it better, because both Jokers, Hoaquin's and Heath's are two entirely different characters - it's impossible compare them). Speaking of Ledger, I appreciate and respect the two subtle nods to his Joker in this film. Chapo bas for these references to the director. ""Joker"" in my opinion is the best origin story, both of the Archduke of Crime and Batman (mini spoiler, sorry). I would highly recommend this film to anyone. "
1382," Hate it or Love It, This Movie is an Instant Classic
"," The best part of this movie is Juaquin Pheonix's performance. He was born to play this role and he absolutely delivers by giving one of the most disturbing and unsettling performances of all time. This movie also has brilliant cinematography, and it looked absolutely gorgeous in IMAX. Todd Phillips managed to give us a new Taxi Driver for our time. It's disturbing, violent, offensive, and shocking, but it forces you to open your eyes and consume every second of it just like Taxi Driver made us do in 1976. "

1402," 'JOKER' is a mental illness study wrapped up in arthouse execution.
"," As a filmmaker is it ok to be inspired by other films? Absolutely, It happens all the time.<br/><br/>What if as a director your homage to particular movies is very obvious? As long as he makes it his own stylistically, it's all forgiven.<br/><br/>""Good artist borrow, Great artist steal"" quote comes to mind.
Whenever you have whole scenes basically copied from previous movies, thats when more mature audience might feel bit cheated because they associate them with movies from the past. However if you find way of original delivery of these ideas you might struck an emotional gold with the audiences as it happened in this case.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice as Todd Phillips's 'JOKER' begins is its 1.85 : 1 aspect ratio, different then the CinemaScope
2.35 : 1 standard widescreen ratio which often is being used on big franchise superhero films, that gives the movie more cinematic feel. This choice alone signalises to the audience that they are watching a superhero movie unlike any other which came before it. One that is stylistically tilted towards Arthouse cinema narrating style, instead of typical standard CGI big budget blockbuster.<br/><br/>'JOKER' is a story of the origin, told as a character study with everything in it screams quality.
In essence it is a film of two half's.
First half of the film is based on character development which is drama based, where we are getting to know our protagonist/anti-hero. The second half of the film turns to a thriller when Arthur Fleck titled JOKER, decides to take his revenge on the people who mistreated him in the past. Its very easy to see parallels between JOKER and other movies like 'Taxi driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982) directed by Martin Scorsese.
Deliberate choice of casting Robert DeNiro as Murray Franklin a chat show host Artur looks up to is for mature audience clear bow towards both Scorsese movies I mentioned. Todd Phillips is very transparent with that, perhaps too transparent. Once again, its ok to pay homage to films from the past, however when you are trying to copy the whole scenes, you need to make sure that your interpretation will be original enough which 'JOKER' does very well indeed.
'JOKER' is very well directed, there is a clarity of what Todd Phillips is trying to communicate to the audience and he is doing it in a very subtle way.
There is a one scene in 'JOKER' which brilliantly showcases the disconnect of Artur from the normal society when he goes to the comedy club to tries to see what jokes get biggest laughs. However being socially inept the timing when he laughs is totally different than other members of the audience. They laugh on punchlines but he seems to be laughing in random moments, showing clear disconnect from collective subconscious part of the society, making him stand out. Simple choice that communicates to the viewer of the movie so much about the loneliness, separation and longing for human connection which Artur feels.<br/><br/>Beautifully lensed by Lawrence Sher with a great slow motion sequences, which gives 'JOKER' grand feature film vibe, but also handheld shots, which with movement of the actor create artistic ballet like sequences when Artur is walking or dancing, putting the audience in a dream like state.<br/><br/>However this film would not be what it is without brilliant character study of Joaquin Phoenix!
His performance is definitely up there with Heath Ledger Oscar winning creation of Joker character in Christopher Nolan's 'THE DARK KNIGHT'.
Performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Artur the clown/standup comic who becomes Joker will surely get him nomination for an Oscar.
Phoenix's performance seems to be little bit more subtle and internal. For this role Joaquin lost over 20KG to inhabit the character physically and developed characteristic laugh that comes out of pain in characters emotional core. The interesting part is that after we witness Artur's misfortunes we start to identify with his struggle because we understand that his mental illness comes from disturbing childhood and years of abuse. His ability to twist his thin body in weird positions reminded me Christian Bale performance in 'The Machinist'(2004) another movie about paranoid delusions.
Joaquins performance of Joker reminds us how weirdly talented he is with acting choices that are very original and emotionally engaging.<br/><br/>On top of everything Todd Phillips in 'JOKER' seems to showcase clash of two worlds.
The world of super rich and those who are poor, who often deal with mental and emotional problems. Even Gotham City is stylized to look like modern day San Francisco to give that incentive.
This film does not promote violence but in a way justifies it. Artur from a victim becomes a hero to many, because he decides to stand up for himself and use image of the Joker as a catalyst for this change and in that way he becomes symbol of revolutionary change for those who are less privileged.
But most importantly 'JOKER' as a movie is a mental illness study intertwine in social and economical satire that brings questions about the discrepancy between super rich and poor people in American society today.<br/><br/>I will most definitely see 'JOKER' again to have further assessment, but after the first viewing I am pretty sure next March we will see some Oscars coming its way.
Highly recommended!
********** out of 10 stars. "
1403," Joaquin has achieved the seemingly impossible!
"," I've seen every cinematic portrayal of the Joker so far and never thought I'd find myself saying anyone played the character better than Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix's version of the clown villian has matched and in my opinion exceeded that of The Dark Knight's. Phoenix keeps you mesmerised from start to finish, and you become totally enveloped in his story and character development.
Although Joker links in the Batman/Wayne storyline, do NOT go to the cinema expecting a comic book movie - this is a character driven drama and not one for the kids, with some pretty brutal scenes. Joaquin Phoenix is a tour de force in this movie, if he doesn't receive an Oscar for Joker it will be a travesty. Kudos also goes to director Todd Phillips for his first dramatic movie, Joker is a fantastic debut. Go see it!! "
1404," JOKER
"," This movie was fantastic in my opinion. Plenty of critics hated on the way this movie was blandly reimagined from films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy, two films I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the film had its own piece of uniqueness especially with Phoenix's amazing performance. From the first minute I was captivated and I loved what Joaquin and Todd were able to do with this character. The soundtrack and score for this movie was also very impressive. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir did a fantastic job and the score never felt over the top to me. Did I like Taxi Driver better, yes, but from a technical and film perspective. I do think, however, that this film manages to capture something that Taxi Driver doesn't and that is the unique saneness and personality of the character we know of as the JOKER. "
1405," A masterpiece that will be talked about for years
"," Movie of the decade.
Performance of the century.
Crazy score and cinematography.
Joaquin Phoenix is the best and darkest joker ever with huge respect to Heath Ledger's phenomenal and outstanding performance.
Depressing.

1406," Extraordinary
"," Todd Phillips' 'Joker' is a well written, incredibly directed and extremely astonishing performed movie. It's a dark movie, including the dark side of life and the part that people want to pretend doesn't exist. The lead actor's Joaquin Phoenix's performance is astonishing to say the least. The cast and crew is very carefully but pinpointed selected making the film surround you with realistic situations that the actors are capable of delivering. The messages, 'Joker', wants to pass are crystal clear and successfully, thus easily, delivered to the audience. The only thing I would consider, not negative, but a bit annoying, is the fact that the batman story is connected with such way to this joker story. To sum up, Todd Phillips', 'Joker' is an excellent, extraordinary film, showing the hard work taken place behind the scenes in the theaters, on the big screen, leaving a bittersweet but joyful feeling. "
1407," To be worth arguing about
"," A movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. ""Joker,"" an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity - as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage - the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance.

I wouldn't suggest taking your kids to this one but that's what makes it so good. It's mature content delivers a punch so strong that you will find yourself pulled into a comic book movie. (I can't believe it's based off of a comic book to be honest it felt so different from every other comic book movie) I strongly suggest it. "
1413," A Cinematic Masterpiece. An Outstanding Performance By Joaquin.
"," 10/out of MF 10. Forget the media fear mongering. This was a relatable film because I am a female with some mental health issues and it covered that aspect with respect and the troubles that go along with being cut off of medication &amp; services. Joaquin's performance is indeed Oscar worthy (not that it even matters to him) and it is on par with Ledger's. It also comes together nicely with a twist I didn't expect in the Batman universe. Anyone who has an issue with this cinematic masterpiece should stick to PG fluffy bunny Marvel films because this Alan Moore material is for us big kids. Go see this film.
Also on a side note I attended the movie with 3 other female friends who all LOVED it so this media outrage about it being only for a certain demographic is completely ridiculous. So yes some of us women are big fans of these films and I hope we continue to get quality cinema such as this. "

This film is beautifully shot and incredibly well written, with a consistent and uncomfortable tone. I have never been more hypnotized by a scene in a film like I was during almost every shot in the last hour of JOKER. Arthur Fleck became whole the moment he truly donned the Joker persona. Phoenix's character development throughout the piece is unheard of. "

1420," Joaquin phoenix....WOW...
"," Joker is undoubtedly the best movie of this year and one of the best in recent times.
When Joaquin phoenix was cast as joker I was a sceptical but after watching this film I can confidently say, he has full justice to this iconic character. His Maniac laugh, his mood swings, his dancing, makeup everything is perfect.
Now, joker is not a superhero movie it's more like a psychological thriller. It's dark and haunting and at times very disturbing. The background music is great and even though the story is slow paced, it has some surprises.
If you are a joker fan like me you will love it, if you love great cinema, you will love it.
Just keep one thing in mind, this is fiction, not a reality.
I have seen some of the criticizing the film based on some absurd reasons. They couldn't find anything wrong in the film but they thought it inspires gun violence and glorifies crime. Let's me tell you, It doesn't. "

1423," Irresistible content!!!!
"," Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally worth watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content. "

Don't believe the hype. Too many DC fanboys on here trying to big up a film after all the recent disappointments from the universe.

I really hope I will like it more with a second viewing because I love the Joker as a character. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelivably good as he is in all his movies and the cinematography is breathtaking but I just didn't feel the story.

It doesn't AT ALL explain how an awkward loner turns into a charismatic criminal mastermind. "

This film pounds you with its message or lack thereof like Batman smacking Joker's head off a desk.

1433," It thinks its really artistic
",
1434," Solid film but there are glaring problems
"," Okay, when I first heard that there was going to be a Joker origin story film I just didn't want anything to do with it. I just feel as though with his ideology in the comics, the cartoon, The Dark Knight movie and other stuff that less is more to explain why he is the way he is. Then the first trailer hit and my expectations changed again, it changed them from ""kind of meh"" to completely sold on the idea. So I sat down and watched it and... it's GOOD but things get a bit complicated.<br/><br/>I'll skip over the plot because I'd like to summarize the benefits and disadvantages this has as a film rather than go over the plot to a movie you've either seen or want to see (I mean I assume that's why readers are here). I'll start with the compliments - Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck is a good and nuanced performance with the steady deterioration from mentally ill but harmless guy that wants to make people laugh, take care of his mother and make ends meet to a psychopathic killing machine is well done, and to address the controversy - I really struggle to see how anyone can interpret this as anything other than sympathetic villain, as in you can see why he does what he does but you don't agree with it.<br/><br/>I'd also say the acting from the other main players, the cinematography, the way it flawlessly blends fantasy in with reality so any 2 people can walk out of this with different opinions of what actually happens in this movie all works well as is the rather nihilistic nature of the plot - where things escalate over essentially nothing does fit in with the idea that this is an origin story to a villain that does horrible things because he thinks it's funny.<br/><br/>So what are my problems? Well I don't think they got the character of The Joker down for one thing - Arthur Fleck slips in and out of fantasy stuff like dates and appearances on his favourite comedy show. I'm going to say it - The Joker's blend of crazy ISN'T the failure to distinguish between fantasy and reality - it's that his ideology is so warped that all the murder, mayhem and violence - he thinks the pain he causes has a funny side to all of it. He also creates complex and intricate plans to all of this - he is essentially as smart or smarter than Batman, a self proclaimed ""World's Greatest Detective"" but also his opposite. Arthur Fleck seems more like a character The Joker of other media would use(for his plan), chew up and spit out like he frequently does with Harley Quinn.<br/><br/>Well I don't think the whole ""That's not The Joker"" is a bad thing, just when you call your movie Joker - it really needs to be said. My other complaint is a very simple one - this story does have themes in it. Mental illness, not treating it properly from the government, income inequality, failed dreams, failed job prospects, failed dating prospects, horrible blood relatives and does absolutely nothing with it. The final scene cuts back to Fleck in a mental hospital - meaning it's big statement on this is ""These exist, do with that information what you will"". Even in media that tries the ""all is for nothing"" stuff whatever it starts bringing up as themes it usually follows through, this doesn't.<br/><br/>I do want to stress that I did enjoy this movie - I just feel as though the idea might not have been there to begin with and people seem to overlook the elements within the film that really aren't as strong - at least not strong enough to be considered #10 on the ""Best movies of all time"" list. "
1435," Not the Joker origin we deserve
"," He is pursuing a career in comedy that he has little talent for. He is being beaten and ridiculed. Standard stuff.
He supposedly laughs uncontrollably due to a condition but later refutes it. Joker's menacing laugh is a big part of the character, this should not be made to be out of his control.
He commits one crime on impulse which for some reason becomes a catalyst for a clown mob movement that later become his followers.
It's accidental not earned. He is mostly self loathing and his final Joker iteration to me felt pathetic.
This is not the Joker origin we deserve.<br/><br/>(Also worst batman origin, that kid Bruce was expressionless) "
1436," Overrated
"," Joaquin Phoenix deserves every bit of praise, but the problem was the plot and its lack of subtlety.<br/><br/>Here's poor Arthur Fleck getting beat up while doing his job. Yeah, you know where this is going. Now he's lost his job, killed 3 people on a train, and learns that his dad has been Thomas Wayne all along. As if life couldn't get worse, his ""mother"" just had a stroke. Scratch that, she's not his mother and T. Wayne isn't his dad - he was adopted and abused as a child. And now, with nothing left to love or lose, the world is laughing at him on television. That's really gotta tip him over the edge. Now it all makes sense. Amazing character development.<br/><br/>*sarcasm*<br/><br/>It's all very on the nose.<br/><br/>Joker would have been better off as an action/fast-paced crime movie, showing how Arthur Fleck rose to the top of Gotham's criminal underworld. They could have handled his character devlopment more subtly, while keeping us on the edge of our seats with an actual exciting story.<br/><br/>Instead it was one long montage of him being screwed over by everyone until he finally snapped. Very predictable and basic. Not the ""deep"" masterpiece it's being made out to be.<br/><br/>Had it been an average acting performance from another actor, the movie would probably be 6.5 or 7 on IMDb right now. The movie itself wasn't anything special except for the last 15 minutes. Its success rests entirely on Joaquin Phoenix's performance. "

When you're making a film about the world's most twisted mind, the end result is bound to be dark and disturbing. If not, then the movie clearly hasn't captured what it means to be turned into the Joker. It doesn't matter whether this film has derived inspiration from a few previous films or any other source for that matter; by itself, this film is unique, classy and a sheer masterpiece. "

"," Once you leave the theatre, you will absolutely feel it was yi=our money's worth. This cannot be said to be just a movie. It has elements to it that can be seen in our society even today. How a person with mental illness is laughed by the society even if there is nothing he can do about it, and also about the divide between the poor and the rich. The directing was simply brilliant and captured the darkness of the mind of the joker, The stroy even if it may be at slow at first will get better as the movie goes on.

", Arthur Fleck lives with his invalid mother. He is suffering from mental illness possibly as a result of childhood abuse. Budget cutbacks put an end to his weekly counselling sessions and he goes off his meds. In real life anyone else would quickly become non functioning but he seemingly becomes more normal.<br/><br/>Consequently he goes from being a bumbling idiot to a highly skilled criminal. I didn't find that realistic at all. He also starts a hardly believable relationship with his beautiful single mom neighbor.<br/><br/>It turns out that was in his imagination but the way it was portrayed made it impossible to tell which scenes were real and which imagined. The scenes with Robert De Niro seem like fantasy but apparently are real.<br/><br/>There were many other scenes that defied belief:<br/><br/>A random work colleague gave him a loaded handgun for free out of concern for his safety. Same person tried to throw him under a bus at the first sign of trouble.<br/><br/>His neighbour left her door unlocked despite the dangerous neighbourhood.<br/><br/>He was a suspect in multiple murders yet the cops made little effort to detain him.<br/><br/>When he kills his mom in the hospital her ECG doesn't sound an alarm and nobody suspected it was him.<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie they recreated a scene from the Dark Knight which reminded me that Heath Ledger was 100 times better.<br/><br/>I cannot see how the Joker portrayed in this movie could possibly become the Joker we know.

I mean you work as a clown and you demand respect, that's pathetic.<br/><br/>The character is just weak and all it needs is a girl who gives him attention and a decent job, that will solve all his problems, which is the problem with his character.

"
1454," A different but equally brilliant portrayal
"," If Ledger showed us the deranged, criminal mastermind that is the joker than Joaquin told us how he got there. The journey is darker and more disturbing and the result is a movie that is so good, so epic, so raw that you walk out thinking, I can't watch that again.
In that way it really is like Taxi Driver, and realistically with what the film is trying to portray I can't help but feel that's a respectful response.
A lot of really satisfying nods to numerous Joker portrayals, in writing, screenplay, soundtrack and in the nuances of Joaquins portrayal.

Parts of the movie were VERY predictable, though a couple (literally two) of surprises that were good but didn't out weigh a very slow moving poorly laid out story.

I also feel like I've seen the Joaquin performance so many times before. The actor who loses a bunch of weight and dances in his underwear. It's been done. Let's see something different!

1460," It's alright, you know
"," There's nothing bad about Joker.<br/><br/>But at the same time, there isn't too much to write home about either.
Joker is more of a movie that you just watch than a movie you experience. Arthur Fleck's is very distant, and a lot of the movie is watching him do weird things (like dance, or put on make up) to Frank Sinatra type music. This has the effect of telling the audience what to feel instead of making them actually feel it.
And it doesn't help that you you pretty much know everything that going to happen.<br/><br/>But is definitely better than Suicide Squad. "
1461," Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film.
"," A film with a laudable performance by Phoenix. The film highlights several unpleasant aspects:
1. The PBA disturbance which I doubt the masses(which includes me) are aware of and the traumatic life such a person may lead
2. The effects of the lack of medication for such a disturbance or the effectiveness of such medicines, in first place
3. The never-ending saga of bullying
4. The general insensitivity of the media and talk show hosts.<br/><br/>The background score of the movie is good but is an overkill.<br/><br/>The screenplay of the movie, the themes and the in general the origin story/retrofit is not only unconvincing and flawed but also seems to deliver a wrong message.
1. The obsession of linking Joker/Fleck to the Wayne family - Fleck's mother's history, Wayne Enterprise employees beating up Fleck and finally the ideological assassination of the Wayne family by a protester
2. Fleck being adopted and having suffered childhood abuse is such a lame and clich√©d plot aspect used by the writers
3. Plausible:
Lack of medication, disturbing discoveries and sort of revenge causes Fleck to go on a killing spree and even enjoying the attention that he receives unexpectedly
Implausible:
Social commentary by Fleck on the show, his sudden liking to riots and chaos. I couldn't believe that they send a detective/psychiatrist to meet Fleck in jail but she's unaware of his disorder and thinks that a PBA-suffering Fleck is laughing at some joke!! Seriously? Are the police and other agencies do dumb to not investigate history of such a criminal?
4. While it's unfair to go into too much of details, I don't understand how a person who likes to dance and become a stand-up comedian would end up having a predilection and some talent in chemical weapons, dynamite, explosives etc. Which are Joker's speciality? Is the viewer supposed to assume that the Fleck cultivates these skills from scratch after he turns into 'Joker'?
5. Last but the most important point - Joker, as we know since ages, is a class-I psychopath who feels no remorse or emotions and enjoys killings and chaos. While such psychopaths get a bit influenced by their surroundings, they are genetically/pathologically having some issues that makes them what they are. In this movie, they somehow try to come up with a cocktail of reasons that give rise to Joker. The worse part is the that riots, vandalism and criminal activities are portrayed as a natural outcome of expressing your discontent.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a poor origin story of an iconic psychopath like Joker. Watch it as an independent psychological thriller but not as a 'Rise of Joker' film. "

I didn't feel sorry for the main character or any of the other characters that he murdered and none of the other characters in the film moved me in any way.

The movie is called Joker, it's Batman's nemesis' origin story.<br/><br/>I particularly like this character, I've admired it since the animated series I was watching growing up.<br/><br/>I feel that this is not the real Joker, this is just a mentally ill person.<br/><br/>The Joker does not suffer from insanity, he enjoys every moment of it.

"," Joker belongs to Joaquin Phoenix, there is no doubt about that, however as a movie, does it stand tall? My answer would be no.<br/><br/>What Joker lacks is a definite construction. The focus was so much on a character that when you turn away your eyes away from the character and try to look at the movie, you are dissatisfied. It looks like the director's aim was to make Joker a victim of circumstances and there are a lot of scenes that felt forced. It felt like the narration is trying really hard to make the audience feel sympathetic towards Joker which is fine considering the fact that Joker as we know of him was actually a misfit and he tried hard to fit in the so called society. What went missing was the binding factor of the narration.
I'm not sure if anyone apart from Phoenix could have played Joker. He is breathtaking and leaves no stone unturned and is the reason why audience stuck to their seats till the end. There is no comparison, however if anyone asks to choose, I would secretly choose Heath Ledger. Again, Phoenix was excellent. "

1502," Joaquin Phoenix slays it in this slowly paced movie
"," ""Joker"" is a movie that features tons of well-done, entertaining and well acted scenes... but it's a bit disappointing for me in terms of story and pacing.<br/><br/>Let me state the obvious: Joaquin Phoenix delivers an amazing performance throughout this picture. He does capture the essence of the character that the movie displays onscreen and every line he delivers is done so in a brilliant manner.<br/><br/>The cinematography and camerawork is also pretty solid and the color palette makes this film look darker and more grounded than most DC outputs. Overall, the presentation of ""Joker"" blends well with the tone and it's a satisfying departure from other Todd Phillips' movies, which are more directed towards the comedy genre.<br/><br/>However, as excited I was for this movie, I can't stop to think how much more I wanted out of the movie after it ended. The pacing is not terrible by any means, but often times it seems as though some scenes felt unnecessary. It's accurate to call this a character-driven film, but even movies like these may suffer from sequences that could have been cut and nothing would have been lost.<br/><br/>The insertion of the Wayne drama and how they connected to the Joker character was not a particularly interesting part for me, but it got even worse in the end when they show once again the origin of Batman. It was really redundant and it takes us back to my previous point about some scenes being useless.<br/><br/>I'm sure the movie wanted its audience to feel sympathy towards the main character and they successfully did that, but it was only because the secondary/background characters were nothing more than stereotypical props who, for no reason at all, just think it's intelligent to start beating somebody up with no concern of what consequences they might face. All those extras who beat up Joaquin Phoenix's character in the beginning of the film are exactly like that - clich√©d props. There's no real reason to not side with Arthur because everyone around him treats him like garbage in a very over-the-top way.<br/><br/>Those issues aside - the ""Joker"" movie is a solid entry in the DC track record and it might change my score upon rewatch, but I certainly wasn't fond of some elements of it.<br/><br/>6/10. "
1503," A journey that audiences can feel

Watch it in bed when you are feeling sleepy so you get a little confused and I GUARANTEE you that you gonna get something pretty similar to the joker.

1512," Slow
", This movie was slow and boring. I did all I could do to keep from falling asleep in the theater. I imagine this is a set up for future films but why did it have to be so boring? 
1513," Don't believe the hype!!!
"," Wow, the concensus here is that this film is a MASTERPIECE, but that's debatable. Where I can say that it's an ""alright"" film is about as honest as it gets. Joaquin Phoenix (while a damned fine actor) played the exact same role with the much better film ""You Were Never Really Here"" in 2017. He tends to play the same or similar character in the majority of his films. Other reviewers of ""Joker""mentions the obvious nods to ""Taxi Driver"" which I agreed with while watching this film, it was just a little too obvious. It sounds like sour grapes to mention that I thought Heath Ledger's Joker was a more fleshed out portrayal of a psychopath, but it simply was. Now with that aside, let's not forget how plain BORING this film was. After 29 minutes some action finally happens with the train scene which was good. The ending (while predictable) was pretty good as well. But between those two scenes..it was dullsville. Just watching Phoenix act oddly for the majority of the film just wasn't enough to CARRY the film on it's own. I believe the phony hype surrounding this film prompting mass shootings etc really helped the box office numbers before anyone really had a chance to see the quality of the film. I say do yourself a favor and re-watch ""You Were Never Really Here"" to watch a much better portrayal of madness from a much better Joaquin Phoenix. "
1514," Below Average, Over Hyped
"," Performance of Joaquin Phoenix aside the overall movie is way too overhyped. It is way too slow and repetitive in the first half, the setbacks haven't been shown dramatic and dire enough to justify his eventual behavior. The laugh is not vicious and more importantly out of place in most sequences. Finally it is not clear how and why he was able to mobilize all the anarchists in the entire Gotham. "
1515," Just wasn't for me
"," I gave 3 stars only because of the spectacular acting, the writing and story get a 0 from me as it doesn't follow any of the hints of joker's origin from other films and shows, so I was displeased to find they made and entire new storyline. I was also annoyed that the Wayne's deaths were included in a new situation as well, almost as if Joker indirectly created batman. Simply I was unhappy with the story they put on the bug screen having been a DC fan my whole life. "
1516," Shallow imitation of better films.
"," Take Taxi Driver and King of Comedy (and maybe a touch of Falling Down), mash them together with only a basic idea of what made those movies good, and use a popular comic book villain as the lead in order to get far more recognition for the film than it would have gotten otherwise and you have Joker.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix may have acted the hell out of the title role, but it doesn't change the fact that Joker is at best a pale imitation of far better films that actually knew how to make a point with their social commentary.<br/><br/>Phoenix's performance and the cursory Scorsese like visual aesthetic may have tricked others into seeing depth where there isn't any... but not me. I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one. "
1517," This is not entertainment
"," The acting and cinematic experience is fantastic. This movie is so dark that its uncomfortable to watch. In so many ways it's a good joker, and in even more ways it's an awful joker. This was a blank slate,they had the opportunity to give us a great joker orgin movie instead it's a character study of a guy going crazy. There's no story,no villains, no plot, nothing. Don't waste your money. "
1518," Deeply boring , no memorable scenes
"," If you like watching 2 hours of dark depressing material with little or no plot or memorable scenes then this is for you. Yes I know it's a character study but I think a film should be entertaining in some way or other, there's even no light relief from the gloom. One boring scene to the next. I'd say avoid. How it's running at 9 on IMDb I'm not sure "
1519," Disappointing, overrated, Worst movie
"," Went to go see this movie thinking it would be an awesome movie going by all the reviews it got about how good it is. This movie was the most overrated, worst movie I had ever seen, it was boring, nothing even interesting happened, if you want to see this movie wait until it comes to DVD cause it's a waste. Don't recommend going to the cinema to see it or even seeing it at all. "
1520," Disappointing and Out of Character
"," After sitting through more trailers than ever before, I was hopeful that the Joker movie would give me a fun insight into the anarchy famed prince of crime. Instead, I sat through two hours of boredom and dissatisfaction discussing with my company more than once if we should leave the theatre. Foremost, this movie demonizes mentally ill individuals, who are statistically more likely to be victims of violent crime than to commit them. And while you can argue that the Joker has always been an unhinged character, I have never seen the character so blatantly portrayed as incapable and schizophrenic. There is a lack of mastermind and a focus on illness to the point where the main character actually writes out ""mental illness"" and it is highlighted in frame. The Joker in this movie could never face a Batman, and yet, he comes face to face with Bruce Wayne so many years before becoming his arch nemesis in a juvenile and disturbing way, inasmuch that he is inadvertently responsible for the death of the Wayne parents in the most contrived and convoluted way possible. Although in this narrative you feel they deserve it as they are seen as nothing but Jeff Bezos/Donald Trump (the movie tries very hard to parallel our political climate in a way that is incoherent and distressing) stand ins. There is also a noticeable absence of the traditional flair that one would attribute to anything Joker related. I have this film two stars. One for Phoenix's outstanding ability to act so well that I felt pity, and ultimately disgust for the main character (although the disgust could be more from how much I disliked the film). And the second for a short scene wherein the Joker empties his entire refrigerator to climb in and enjoy sitting in the darkness which is exactly what I would have preferred to watching the film. Lastly, because of the recent climate and the shooting in Colorado, this film made me feel unsafe. At one point during a quiet scene the theatre door opened and every head turned in alarm. The person who was responsible for Colorado is the exact type of person this was made for... people looking for the world to take pity on them because they feel invisible. And this film will vindicate these feelings because it is not until the end that we see this ""hero"" is nothing more than an unreliable narrator. I deeply love DC, but this film fell flat, felt boring, and most importantly for me was out of character for what could truly have been a deep and meaningful backstory. "
1521," No, I Don't Think So
"," I really did not enjoy this movie, I definitely did not leave the theater wanting for more, more like when will this end? Joaquin is definitely a great actor, but was disappointed in the storyline. Not sure what I wanted, but I know I didn't receive it in this movie. Was not entertained in the least bit. Oh well. "
1522," DO NOT WATCH
"," THE ONLY REASON I GIVE THIS FILM 1 STAR IS BECAUSE I COULDNT GO ANY LOWER. This movie is not a joker movie and has no relation to what the joker is. Somebody wrote a movie and slapped joker on it. Absolute crap and boring. Not convincing at all to even scare me, and I'm scared of everything. "
1523," Lame
"," This movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son &amp; I kept looking at each other like should we just get up &amp; leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently. Just shows you, don't believe the reviews. If a movie speaks tour interest, go see it for yourself. This movie however, I wouldn't recommend. It's a total bore. "
1524," Joker
"," A very serious look at how the famous comic book character came into being. Starting with personal failures and challenges, the character (Phoenix), through an act of violence inadvertently causes social change that slowly but surely brings things to their inevitable explosive and violent conclusion.<br/><br/>Often slow and very intense, but never boring, the whole, beautifully filmed exercise completely revolves around Phoenix and his extraordinary performance. A unique film to be sure and one to watch - but not a little troubling. "
1525," Terrible-not dark, just sick and boring
"," I was so excited about this movie and can not recall when I was this disappointed. This movie is not an accurate dark portrayal of the joker from a different perspective like I hoped. It's a sick pitiful movie that took the enjoyment out of the comic and the character for me. It was boring and instead of getting better, just kept getting worse. "
1526," Why so this way
"," Hi, first of all I tried not to compare this to Heath's performance, but after half the film passed by the grip of what could have and replaced by oh no, I must say Joker's display was one of feeble stance. Sure life knocks you in the face with iron knuckles, yet Heath showed it could be appreciated with a smirk. Phoenix buckles inward because he just can't help it and doesn't like it.
This might have been set up as a possible gate way to how and when he started to be Joker as we all hoped to see, but it sure as beep left me seeing a sorry of an excuse to turn so dark for some everyday struggle gone bad and turn left at revenge intersection.
Never was, in my recollection, Joker set out best as the dog who didn't know what he'd do once he got hold of the bumper of a car going by. Now they showed a possible reason why, and deep down they shouldn't have showed this. It's too beep easy passing the start frame and collect your 2000. Joker is matured insanity, should they have put some in the movie all could have been overlooked. "

Joker is a strong story with incredible attention to detail, going as far to show Arthur Fleck (Joker) almost being more physically healthy with the Joker makeup on.<br/><br/>
Joker presents a darker look at todays society and the stigmatization of the mentally ill and how they are ""subhuman"", to the point were the film blurs the lines of reality and fiction, several times demonstrating that Joker could have been helped but instead was ignored by an ignorant government and population.<br/><br/>Joker is an incredible film that should be on all viewing lists and I would highly recommend for you to go see it "

1540," Ctitics Miss the Boat
"," I think a lot of reviewers and critics did not watch this movie to the end. For example, read Morgenstern's review at WSJ. The movie can only be understood if you stay fir the last scene. In the last scene Phoenix is in a mental hospital talking to a nurse. This movie is about mental illness. It has nothing to do with Batman. Phoenix is mentally ill. Throughout his life he was mis-treated, abused, made fun of, and abandoned by his family and society. He is delusional and his experience is reflected by the illusion of the Batman/Joker comic. The ""Joker"" is a delusion of this mentally ill person who was on meds and had them taken away. The movie is his fantasy of rebellion and revenge. I found this a very powerful and somewhat brilliant way of addressing mental illness. The reason why it is misunderstood is because it involves gun violence but does not condemn it. Morgenstern's review is a good example. The pc cause du jour is gun violence, not mental illness. "
1541," JOKER IT'S JUST EPIC
", I'm not a big fan of comics. But I am fan of everything around the pop culture that superheroes are. So I know a couple of things about Gotham and Batman.<br/><br/>My hype for this movie was because it's proclaimed as very violent and talks about mental issues. I love characters with mental health problems so watching this was awesome. The Joker it's the first movie with a low pacing and obviously not commercial that I would say it's my favorite of all times.<br/><br/>The third act of this movie it's golden. No spoilers but the ending left me shaking. 
1542," Tells more about our present than about Joker's past
"," Well played, well shot but one wonders why the movie theater is packed with Teens and Twens obviously enjoying the film.
The plot stays within the usual boundaries: Villains have to have a condition to avoid that society (even the rich) is left with all the blame. I have seen worse films but I apart from some very intense camera work and acting, I left the movie with mixed feelings, mostly because I wonder what makes others rave about this story. With all the current anger and protests around the world, from the yellow jackets in France to the protesters in Hong Kong, Quito, Barcelona and Santiago de Chile one explanation might be that this plot about the origin of anger and aggression in a troubled looser who blames individuals, not the system, to be ignorant and deaf to his needs, apparently seems logical to a generation without other means to explain their personal anger.

1543," Captivating
"," This film draws you in from the very start and keeps hold of you right to the very end. You shouldn't feel sorry for him but you do, you just want people to be nice to him and for him to have a better life but then there wouldn't be any point to the film if that was the case. I'm not a Batman or super hero fan but you don't need to be to watch it. Whilst it obviously links to the super hero films, it's still a standalone film in its own right and a brilliant psychological crime drama. Never before have I seen a film that I'm still thinking about a week later. "
1544," A story told just right
"," The story telling is so brutal that it's almost poetic. I didn't watch the trailer and just thought it'd be a Batman-ish movie. I was grasped by the story telling from the very first shot. The settings, the music and the best part, performance, made me fully immersed in the story. "
1545," Standing ovation!!!
"," This was the first time that I witness an audience giving applause at the end of a movie in cinema. I can tell you it was totally worth it - every piece and every second of it. I was left haunted after the first screening, so I went for an another today and it was the same like the first, full of joy and excitement, seeing Arthur transforming into Joker.... Joaquin blew our mind, the audience was enjoying as if it were live screening. If his Majesty Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar, I can say and please allow me to quote Roberto Benigni from ""La tigre e la neve"" - they can close this whole show of a world... they can cart it off, unscrew the stars, roll up the sky and put it on a truck, they can turn off this sunlight..... Hats off! "

1549," An epitome of Excellence
"," To the people, who say Joaquin Phoneix deserves an Oscar for his performance, please pardon me, but I beg to differ. This guy does not deserve an Oscar, Oscar should beg in front of him and say ""Please accept me!"". He is a walking university of acting. Every scene, every private moment, every emotion, its beyond human perfection! This kind of cinema is a rare commodity. I could give million stars to how everything in this movie was picture perfect (from direction to music to acting to cinematography to screenplay). Please watch it in theaters. You will not be disappointed! "
1550," Same old story
"," Remember the two minutes in Japanese anime before the villain dies, he starts remembering the bad incidents and situations that led him to be evil.
This film is about that except instead of two minutes it's two hours.
It will make a good 1st episode in the 1st season in some TV series, so don't get your hopes high.
You will have to watch it anyway, otherwise you will miss Joaquin Phoenix amazing performance. "

"," I think it will win oscars for bedt cinematography ,best screenplay,best actor in a leading role "
1552," Best movie I've seen in a long time! Absolute Masterpiece!!
"," I would like to start off by saying that Joaquin Phoenix is a goddamn genius! His acting is out of this world and it truly brings together this beautiful movie. I seriously cannot think of one thing I didn't like about the movie and honestly I don't understand how people can possibly dislike it. First off, for people saying it's slow and boring, it's not meant to be a typical action packed superhero movie. If you went into the movie thinking that's what you were getting with this movie then you need to take a film education class. And if you don't see the amount of finesse and time was put into the movie then I don't know what to tell you. All in all, thank you Joaquin and Todd for creating such a beautiful historic movie! If this movie doesn't win at least 1 or 2 oscars on top of Joaquin alone then we will riot with clown masks. "
1553," Oscar winner
"," I got home from watching this in theaters a few hours ago,. It is truly one of the greatest, spectacular, wonderful and most marvelous movies ever made. 10 out of 10!!!!!. From start to finish, I was completely hypnotized from this true cinematic wonder.<br/><br/>original, outside of the box, risk taking and unpredictable. I love that with a capital L.<br/><br/>Even though its not exactly true to the comics, but truly love how much the movie's originality was inspired by them.<br/><br/>I put this on top of my list of my most favorite movies that stand out. Along with my favorite directors and favorite actresses (ariana grande and eiza Gonzalez) rare gems that truly stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>I'm a filmmaker myself and JOKER also inspired me to shoot with the Alexa 65 even much more now. (Someday soon)<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! "
1554," Not an action movie, but a psychological thriller.
"," I see a lot more great reviews for this now but when it first came I saw a lot of hate. I don't understand that at all, those people to me only wanted an action movie as they apparently didn't have the intelligence to understand a psychological thriller like this. As I stated, this wasn't trying to be an action movie, it wanted to show the Jokers transformation from harmless crazy guy down the street to full on psychotic criminal kingpin. I don't think this is really a major spoiler, but I loved how we were able to see young Bruce Wayne's story unfold in the background as well! I told my sister when we talked about a sequel that if she wanted to know what happens next, go straight to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight, then you'll be able to watch two brilliant performances in a row as the Joker, (You were awesome, too, Bale, but this is about the Joker- lol). and basically see the whole story of his life in those two movies. But, that's not to say I'm not onboard with a Joker sequel! I think this is in the running, if not the front runner, for my best movie if the year, but I'll have to sit down and have a look at all the others I've seen! Awesome flick! "
1555," So good
", I like everything in the joker like his sadly laugh and his joker run and his body and his nervous 
1556," Truly a masterpiece!
"," This movie isn't for all viewers who subscribe to mature audience material, especially viewers with acute depression and other mental disorders. Yet those who courageously go through the motions will find a high level of appreciation for the extreme psychologically graphic material delivered masterfully by an actor whose whole career is outshone by his performance in this movie alone.<br/><br/>This being said, the iconic supervillain is finally seen coming to terms with his downhill path to unlock his true nature that defines the true nature of the Clown Prince of Crime, and the sordid story of his relationship to his mother.<br/><br/>Much also provided with DeNiro's up top performance that greatly magnifies the intensity of one of the most shockingly memorable movie climax moment seen in years.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix outdid himself all around and outdid the hype masterfully. "
1557," A GREAT MOVIE!
"," Before I went and saw Joker in theatre's I was afraid that the movie would turn out a disaster but at the same time I was thinking we don't really need this movie, but when I walked out of the theater the first viewing I was extremely happy of how the movie turned out. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was fantastic he felt so real. I really liked how it was a origin story for joker but it still didn't tell you everything most things in the movie you will have to figure out yourself, I love when they do that in movies. The only little flaw I had in the movie is that it felt a little to much like the Taxi Driver, it kind of has the same plot and if you have seen that movie Joker could get a little predictable but that is really the only thing I have wrong with the movie. So yeah over all I absolutely loved this film and I recommend checking it out. "

"," Just watched the movie and it was wonderful. I just don't want to spoil things, but I would advice everybody to watch this masterpiece. The acting is top notch.<br/><br/>I don't understand all the backlash from journalists. It's far from being an incel motivated movie. These reporters don't know what incel actually means. This movie has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>We all know who deserves an oscar! "

"," I saw very praising reviews and some of my friends said it's masterpiece. Some said it's very boring. But I think it is something between it.<br/><br/>Definitely not a boring movie, but I think there could be done something more. But acting was really impressive.<br/><br/>P.S. I am here with update. One day passed, and I am still thinking about the Joker. Rewatched trailer. I wish movie was little bit better though, and I understand that movie is good mostly because of Joaquin Phoenix. Wish it were focused more on what he's done than on how hurt he was. Mostly it's bad when a movie is too long, but here I wish there were extra 20-30 minutes to fill the story. Sorry for my english. "
1564," I'll never listen to Frank Sinatra the same way again...
"," Joker is outstanding. One of 2019's biggest surprises. Not once did it seem like I was watching a comic book movie. It's a chilling and artful approach to the iconic villain that doesn't hold back on exploring mental illness in a brutally raw and honest way. Even with its occasional touches on the Batman mythos, which flowed well with the story and didn't seemed forced at all, the focus is entirely on Arthur Fleck's turmoil and transformation into the Joker and Joaquin Phoenix delivers a richly disturbing performance to support that. The psychological twists to some story cliches were unexpected and refreshing, too. Amazing film. Not for the faint of heart. "
1565," A brave new world.
"," This is a landmark movie. Maybe one of the most important movies to be released in the last 10 years.
Not only is the film brilliantly made from how it looks and sounds, but it also has something to say it has balls.
I hope this film changes Hollywood perception on how not just comic book films are made but all films. "
1566," Amazing
", This is the Joker i was waiting for! The acting the soundtrack everything just made a such a bit impression. 
1567," Masterpiece Of Dark Depth
"," This picture gives real insight into the mind of the joker and really builds his story like never before...<br/><br/>In doing that it really gives some raw insight into the issues revolving around mental health, and it does it very realistically not sparing the dark details.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix should most definitely be considered for a oscar due to his incredible performance as the JOKER.

"," Lets just not talk about acting, making, bgm and all, because I know its a pure art, masterpiece. but this is something about reality, existence. when you realise everything around you is full of lies, awful, careless, just living in someone's story, being some human 'thing'. Then you feel you are not exist. if really want to exist, you have to become unknown that is 'Joker' "

Just watch it! "
1571," Take a ride with the Joker
"," This is worth the wait. If the academy does not appreciate this, then they should just give an oscar to whoever they get drunk and play name the worst movie of the year. This is worth it.

1574," Masterpiece!!!!
"," Where do I begin, I didn't think anyone was able to make a movie like this after Dark Knight. The emotions I experienced in this movie, I don't think I have felt like this in a movie theater in a long time. The acting, direction, cinematography &amp; music all deserve awards. Joaquin Phoenix is by far the best actor working today. His transition from normal man into Joker was chillingly convincing. Makes all marvel movies look cartoonish and kids play. This is masterful movie making, with top notch acting. A must watch!! "
1575," Damn what a movie
", It blew me and my wife away. I was skeptical at first but wow unbelievable film. Definitely a must see. If Joaquin doesn't get a Oscar for this then the Oscars are rigged. I couldn't believe how I was on edge of my seat the entire film. Me and the wife will be going next weekend to see it again. 
1576," Better than expected
"," I had mixed feelings after watching the trailer. I said to myself that this won't be a good movie, no effects, no fast-paced action, no Batman, no classical Joker.<br/><br/>Actually you don't need any of these in order to make a great movie. Joker is brutally realistic and atmospheric. It makes you feel thorned, in some moments you like and emphatise the main character, in others you hate him. We witness the development of a character and the birth of the Joker in a very realistic way. We miss such movies nowadays with good story telling, great atmosphere and almost to no CGI. I just loved it, this is what cinema should be every now and then. "
1577," Incredible movie!
"," Insane movie, great acting, great plot and character development. And also a great insight in the forming of the Joker and the Batman. "
1578," Just amazing

1579," a masterpiece
"," Only Joaquin can do such an amazing job and give this character what it deserves, great music. and great acting. totally worth an Oscar.. "
1580," I created an account just to review this movie
"," I went into this movie skeptical in terms of the hype around it. Now I understand it and I believe it deserves every part of it. The acting was, without exaggerating , the best I've ever seen from a male protagonist. As a literature enthusiast, the plot gave me the same feeling of watching a true literary classic unfold. Artistically, the construction of the scenes was immaculate, with the television reflecting the protagonist's psychological state and the recurring motifs of laughter and media used in the brightest of ways. The political commentary was not only well constructed but also incredibly relevant in our times. If you haven't watched Joker yet, stop whatever you're doing and run to the theater, this one is going down in history! "
1581," Perfect movie
", Perhaps the best movie of this decade. A must watch. 
1582," Funny and terryfying that topic of this movie is so common in real life

1583," Contributing to the best movie this 2019
"," I like how Joaquin walks and dances on that stairs after all his been through. Ive been holding on my chairs on what will happen next. Its like im with the character all through out the movie. This is really good movie.
Actually i felt better after watching this movie. Been with a breakup recently and trying to move on and i dont know but actually this movie really helps me to move on. I listen to the songs used in this movie while going to work and i felt better. I could not thank enough how this movie save my life. I feel like im always happy everyday especially when i listen to ""That's Life by Frank Sinatra."" I imagine Joker and how he survive all those difficult times. Joaquin, Joker, i cant thank u enough. Thank u so much. You save my life. "
1584," Dear DC make more movies like this. Please.
"," Joker is what I call a masterpiece, the film was phenomenal, brilliant,etc. I saw the film x2 and i was the best film I have ever seen. People say Avengers Endgame, is the best films of this year..... ROTFLMFAO. Joker is the best movie of 2019. As for Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck/Joker, what can I say he deserves an Oscar for this performance, I can not stop praising how good he was, I felt every pain and laugh he went through, the film was just great. Ceaser Romero and Heath Ledger would be proud of this guy. Joaquin Phoenix is the guy who would put his acting skills first then the money. He was dedicated to play the Joker and he absolutely nailed it. Todd Phillips is now one of my favorite directors now, along with Matt Reeves, Steven Spielberg, and Chris Nolan. I saw two times and I plan to see it again. Because, movies like these deserve 2 billion dollars in the box office, NOT ENDGAME. 10/10. The best movie of 2019 in my honest opinion. "
1585," A BLOODY MASTERPIECE!!!!
"," I was really hyped about this movie ever since the teaser came out. And after a long wait, I saw this movie and now, I can happily say that the wait was worth it. It's one of the best DC movies of all time. I can't really compare this to The Dark Knight 'cause I love both the movie and it's really difficult to choose one. But one thing I can say without a doubt is that JOAQUIN PHOENIX nailed it. I haven't seen such great acting in a really long time. Joaquin Phoenix gave complete justice to Joker's character. The best origin story of Joker according to me. I don't why the critics are going bonkers. I literally loved this film. I hope it gets nominated for Oscars 'cause this movie deserves it. "
1586," Wow!!!!!! You must watch it
"," We just went to Gold Class theatre tonight; in no small part due to the amazing reviews we read about Joker... we were not disappointed. It was incredible.
I am a big fan of the Batman Begins series, but this is not that. It is a character study, deeply disturbing, emotional and riveting... we were both spellbound.
There is no action, but we were on the edge of our seats none the less. It is an Oscar winning performance for Joaquin Phoenix or the Oscars are a joke. The whole movie is him, and he's incredible. I cried, I gasped, I laughed, I sympathised when the worst happened. I have always adored Chris Nolan's Batman, but this made me pity the joker.
I enjoyed the Avengers movies. But if that's what you want, move on. This is acting and character development at its highest form. If you don't appreciate acting and English at its highest level, it's not for you.
Bravissimo Joaquin, this was a lifetime's performance.
10/10 truth be told. "

This movie was written produced and played so well beyond words that can be spoken! The fact is this movie is just like society now people have no care or manners anymore. Everyone is so selfish and busy with themselves they only look out for themselves. People are given a bad hand and end up with issues that do need attention and help and our government spends more time on other things than actually helping our people in our nation! And we wonder why things happen tragedies happen then it gets attention why does it take that! This movie is an eye opener! "

1591," A movie witch complete interpretation the joker spirit from grow to strong.
"," The director make the every lens abnormally delicate to draw the joker in exquisite,and let audience go deep into the joker's ""CRAZE"" mind.<br/><br/>Although the delicate lens lead to the plot slow forward, but it also let us know that ""How did the society making human's mind fall apart"".<br/><br/>Last but not least,one of the prop ,joker mask,I think the director layout the other people wearing the mask is mean they use the joker mask to reasonable their behavior.<br/><br/>The opposite of the protagonist make up his face from outside(face) to inside (tongue),it means not only just the surface ,but also the spiritual become the joker. "
1592," A movie about us
"," People complaining about the violence, gore and disturbing scenes in this movie seem to forget the nature of the world we live in. The movie is about us, the world embodied in a character, losing its grip to reality and being irrational alltogheter in an artsy way. Beautiful picture, beautiful acting, everything's beautiful. The world's distruction is indeed beautiful. Watch the movie, draw your conclusions and go change the world while you still can. "

"," Simply put, they took the most evil character in comic book history and made him not only relatable, but sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is riveting. I couldn't look away from the screen. This is a movie that sticks with you long after it is over. A brilliant social commentary as well about society's indifference towards mental illness and it's ineptness in dealing with the mentally unstable. By this point, I'm sure you've heard so much about this movie already. Just do me, yourself, and the cinema fan inside you a huge favor and go see it as soon as humanly possible. Thank me later. "

1597," The best
", Best joker ever everthing was perfect from A to Z story was ture the act was true and soundtrack oooooo that was a thing 
1598," An absolute masterpiece
"," This is one of the greatest movies I've seen in the last 5 years. The music, cinematography, acting everything was magnificent!! "
1599," So many acts of violence, one singular film
"," To Care or Not to Care....That Is the Question I put forth as the Theme of this film. To spoil my answer without you having to read the whole thing.....It's a bit of both.<br/><br/>The Violence is the Crux of the Film<br/><br/>Arthur, or Joker maybe at this point, commits different acts of violence through out the film. The first one is on a subway train where he his jumped by three men. Many want to point out whether these guys are rich and that they are white, etc... I rather keep this about the act that is committed to strengthen my opinion that this first act of of violence Joker does is totally self defense. Many people have suffered death taking feet to the body and head, let alone three pairs of them. Now, you might question how he followed and gunned down that third individual after the fact he ran away. I would only argue that in his heightened state of survival, the fight isn't over until you've eliminated the enemy. Many soldiers who have experienced war will tell you this. It may not be normal in regular circumstance, but in the middle of battle, its just how you think.<br/><br/>So that is my verdict. On the train, he isn't a murderer. He isn't a monster. He is just a person defending his life. Now, that said, I still think this event let Joker get a taste of something that he eventually takes him to places that I don't agree with. This is what is so great about this film. Its a slow turning. Something that's hard to look at in society when most people are trying to live there lives in whatever degree. Whether they are happy, sad, mad, and everything in between.<br/><br/>So use this film to discuss these acts. It will hopefully carry over into society in a positive way.<br/><br/>Now the Next act of violence......<br/><br/>This one is too me the one that really hits home. You see this guy break in the worst way. A man who was very alone, and yet the one person in his life, his mother, did not belong to him and vise versa. He murdered this woman. A woman who provided for him while still dealing with her own mental health. This shows you how disconnected Arthur had become. He felt totally victimized. This bothers me in two ways. One I wish I knew how to help. And Two, It also makes me feel righteous anger at him for not realizing he wasn't as bad off as he thought.<br/><br/>I don't need to be angry with his act, because Justice is best delivered without passion. My passion is put towards the loss of lives that he took and the loss of Arthur Fleck himself. Its a Losing situation of a film, and so it challenges you too think of how to win. You win by examining life a little more. You don't owe anyone anything in this world, but a little reflection when watching films like these isn't going to kill anyone.....pun Indented.<br/><br/>Well its off from there......That Apartment scene.....well I don't need to try to describe it.....it is what it is. The Joker is solving his problems in full comic book villain mode. (Right or Wrong, Joker always feel free, so enjoy it, its a movie.)<br/><br/>Finally he point blank, in true Joker fashion, shoots Murray Franklin in the face on live television.<br/><br/>So there it is. A man trying to solve his problems through violence. It had to have made him feel better. And so I ask whether you agree with this Joker or not, maybe now you can understand the why. And if you can understand that, then maybe this film has done what it set out to do. "
1600," First and out of respect for this Movie Last time I will write Review
"," This movie is just outstanding, from the Music to the writing and camera and just the little things.
It's just a Masterpiece and I will need to watch it a second time in a few days.
JP needs to get the Oscar because his Performance to me was once in a lifetime, the Laughter and the anger he shows are more than just acting it's in his soul I feel like.
I can't say enough about his performance.
A masterpiece and just perfect from beginning to end.
Every thing I wished for and even more.
Thank you very much for this amazing experience of Cinema "
1601," Amazing Work of Art
", Wouldn't change a thing about it except i wish it was an hour longer. The camera angles and character development was astounding. Pleasantly surprised all of my expectations.I want a sequel that deals with arkam asylum and more villains like underutilized poison ivy and more. But as far as the story line with batman... this movie could end and then say 15 years later and start playing the dark knight and would make total sense.

You'll wonder for days to come what actually happened in this movie, and that's what makes it so worth while. Joaquin Phoenix makes you so uncomfortable in this movie with his acting, that's how good he is.<br/><br/>Two quick warnings: Please don't take your children to this movie and please, if you have any mental illness or know someone with a mental illness, this movie will not be best idea to watch. "
1604," Excellent
", Can't remember the last time I left a cinema feeling this way 
1605," Oscar worthy for acting
"," Joaquin nailed it with his beyond the extra mile acting. He showed that he truly understands the character of Arthur Fleck, his sufferings, conditions, psychological issues, etc. He really shelled out this character. Performing a pathological laughter while crying seems to be an incredibly hard task to act out but yet he nailed it perfectly.<br/><br/>He changed my view on the fact that I should be wary of people who seems different from us and should acknowledge that they may or may not have a psychological/mental condition.<br/><br/>I gave 9/10 because the movie was quite slow but I understand that this was necessary to give us the audience a realistic transformation from Arthur to the Joker we know for at least the last 60 years.<br/><br/>This film beats most movies I've seen mainly because of the quality acting given by Phoenix. "
1606," Masterpiece
"," Best film in this century. Amazing. Over 10 months ago when I saw the teaser I was like ""Eh another dumb movie"" well let me tell you all something I was incredibly ""wrong"".

1610," A poetry of darkness
"," There are very few movies that leave an impact on you hours or probably even days after leaving the movie theatre. Joker is surely one of them and on the top shelf. The character portrayal is so strong and acting is so natural and deep that one cannot just let it out of one's mind. I was not sure whether to get sad or excited, depressed or ecstatic, serious or laugh. Its just a flury of emotions running through you and keep you glued to screen. Cinematography is awesome by choosing the right mix of colors and shots in a recession hit Gotham city. Music keeps you on the edge of the seat and there wont be enough words to describe the acting of Phoenix which is once in a lifetime performance. "

1612," So good I never want to see it again
"," You know those moments that leave you so stunned that you realize what you've just witnessed is a once in a lifetime experience? That's what I got with Joker. This film literally had me experiencing all types of emotions, I was on edge the entire time. I felt pity, I felt anger, I felt anxious, I felt second hand embarrassment And I felt fear. this film was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least.<br/><br/>The casting was incredible. I honestly thought that no one else could play the Joker as well as Heath Ledger, but Joaquin brought Joker from comic book villain to Human Antihero. Absolutely incredible. "

1616," An utterly beautiful movie
"," Joker is a character study type comic book film different from comic-flicks of those days. It is one of the best and realistic movie I ever seen. It shows every aspects of a man's life and it's struggles. Also the violence was higher than anticipated. Arthur killing 3 men in subway, his mother and Murray on the show was quite disturbing. His story keeps an emotion within ur heart. Also Phoenix's performance is at ledger's level making it absolute and film of the year. Still the ending shows the bloody smile that joker will laugh when he shall bring this movies to Oscar. "

"," Best original store , the conversion between Arthur and joker now make a lot more since now , he's a crazy dude but he have hes reason . "
1632," A trip back to the late 70s early 80s
"," The film will remind you very much of taxi driver and the king of comedy. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job. He was one of the most scariest characters I have seen in years. The film is violent and does glorify it to an extent, however this should not be condemned since it'sa creative direction, and it's a movie based on a comic book villain, so it should be expected. Phenomenal cinematography and great soundtrack to go with it. "
1633," This movie is a work of art.
"," The system hates this movie because it's too close to reality, see the disconnect between the critics views &amp; the paying public, this is exactly why people voted for Trump &amp; for Brexit &amp; why this movie is so dangerous because it suggests a sense of empowerment &amp; a pulling down of the established order. "
1634," On Another Level
"," Got nothing to say but , he deserves the that 10 review the acting was on point the production was on point Thanks to all whomever involved in producing this great movie to us .... Thanks for the hardwork "
1635," Give this man an Oscar!
"," Mesmerizing performance by the legendary Joaquin Phoenix is only one piece of a puzzle that makes this movie a must to watch. You simply cannot move your eyes away from him throughout the entire film and that's about 99.9 percent of the time he is on screen. Yes, he carries it on his own and everyone else is just a side character.
The screenplay and the brilliant direction Todd Phillips decides to take the film surpasses all the expectations of the viewer. When watching it, it's very difficult to predict what will happen in the next scene and that's what makes this film stand out from the bunch.
I don't remember the last time, I was asking that many questions after leaving the theater.
As a matter of fact, I am going to see the film again tonight to try to comprehend the complex nature of Arthur Fleck's mind and just to enjoy the brilliant cinematography. "
1636," I may not be a expert film critic or a professional at all, but this movie is a complete Masterpiece in a lot of aspects.
"," First of all as you may have heard before, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is amazing. I don't really know how to explain it but throughout the movie I was totally convinced that this guys is really going crazy and his actions and facial expressions completely support that.
Second of all I find that the main criticism this movie gets is sympathizing antisocial extremists. Did joker just disappear after the Dark Knight? Like did they seriously forget that he is meant to be one of the most vicious and disturbing characters in comic books? After the killing joke the Joker's tone has been pretty set. It's meant to be an origin story for a VILLAIN not a hero. Now onto why the movie itself does not try to justify joker's actions, rather it wants us to help people like him. I think the main analysis came out in Joker's debate with Murray, he said something like(can't remember the exact wording) ""this is what happens to underprivileged and disenfranchised people when you have a cruel society, uncivilized people and a system that doesn't work!"" I think he was saying this not only to Murray, audience of the talk show or to the people of Gotham. He was saying it to us. The movie is telling us to take joker as an extreme example and be kind and thoughtful to everyone around you. To the people who live high above, come down and see how hard it is for them to simply put food on the table instead of just showing a blind eye like Thomas Wayne (disregarding the debate on whether joker is his son or not). The movie was also incredibly well-paced. The character development although I think didn't go its full potential, I was very satisfied. It also ties all its loose ends and explains really well how joker and what he symbolizes came together, as well as the birth of batman and their rivalry. Definitely my favorite movie of this year yet. "
1637," I'm still thinking about this movie, Joaquin was Incredible
"," I'm still trying to digest what I've just seen, it was absolutely incredible, forget the fact that it was the joker - Joaquin Pheonix's interpretation of arthur fleck was unlike anything I have seen before. It will be character studied and debated for years to come. Absolutely incredible "
1638," Do not believe the mainstream paid critics!

"," I saw tons of reviews leaving 10 stars and saying ""so excited to watch this"" and others leaving 1 star to ""counterbalance""<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it despite all that, the movie was thrilling engaging and generally so entertaining! I wouldn't go in expecting an action movie though, it's not marvel. Get yourself ready for something closer to a character study. "

1644," Outstanding
", One of the best movies in ages and Phoenix is just exceptional 
1645," A movie you wish it lasted forever
"," Taking it as a whole since its chilling beginning to the groundbreaking Joker-worthy ending, this movie should be recognized as a movie you don't want a sequel to, but only wished it lasted forever. Joaquin's masterpiece acting should, throughout the upcoming decades, be described as one of the best, if not the very top, of what we've ever been able to witness. "
1646," Astonishing
", This might be one of the greatest movies ever created. Ive watched the movie twice already and it is really jawdropping. Media just hates on this movie but don't mind it. And When you watch the film dont compare it to the dark knight or any other joker movie. This is a Drama movie not an action movie. So get yourself hyped up and se hos the joker was created. Heath Ledger would be so proud. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing Job. Incredible acting really. 
1647," This movie STINKS...

1650," It shook me to the core!!!
", It is mind blowing. You all have to watch to believe me and prepare for some disturbing scenes you are going to see in the movie. And I highly suggest not to take your young ones who are 16 or below to this movie. This movie is no IT chapter 2. This movie is much more disturbing and terrifying than IT chapter 2 will ever be. 
1651," Simply Brilliant

1652," Blown away
"," One of the best performances I've seen from an actor, the film made me feel uncomfortable had me laughing and also happy and sad, my emotions were on a rollercoaster.
The little nods to the Gotham world was subtle but nice.
Make sure you watch this !! "
1653," Jack Nicholson's Joker is a (very) distant third.
"," Let me start by saying, this is a DC universe I want to further explore.The movie does an excellent job connecting most of the main Gotham characters and the possibilities for a sequel or sequels are endless.
Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best male lead. His performance of Arthur Fleck (i.e. Joker) is truly remarkable and with minimal dialogue, he conveys pain, disgust and an eventual decent to madness that will shock you. This is the most realistic Batman related movie.
The movie is a character and society study. On one hand, a character abused, beaten, humiliated and totally ignored and on the other hand, a society literary overrun by rats.
The story of the particular Joker is truly heartbreaking. From a boy full of happiness to the Joker. By the end of the movie, you are shocked but feel that you understand why Arthur Fleck became the Joker.
Don't pay attention to the ""woke"" media. Joker is an excellent movie and maybe one of the best comic book movies. "
1654," I'm speechless
", So far the best movie I've ever seen in my life.. I watched it 3 times already just to know how did the joker acted like this.. Its simply amazingly done by the director 
1655," What an absolute work of art
"," This movie blew me away. ABSOLUTELY perfect. I'm not a big fan of joker or it's previous movies but went to watch it anyway with friends and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely stunning, what a performance! This is ACTING! "
1656," Haunting masterpiece
"," Joaquin Phoenix is so incredible as the joker. His physical and emotional performance is a must see for anyone who appreciates great acting. I also felt the direction and cinematography gave for some truly beautiful, albeit haunting, shots. Bravo! "
1657," Better than I expected!

1660," Masterpiece. Best Joker adaptation.
", This movie is a study on mental illness. It brings awareness about problems in society. Not giving anything else away. You'd have to see it to believe it. Joaquin Phoenix exceeded my expectations. His Joker has surpassed Heath Ledger's version in my opinion. 
1661," Art meets cinema
"," An actor can elevate cinema, a mass entertainment medium to art which elevated the soul.<br/><br/>The back story to how Joker became the Joker is moving, disturbing and entertaining at same time. The story moves along at its own pace and the moral justification for have nots may have its distractors but it is firmly in keeping with the Gotham universe. The descent of the Man into a place where nothing matters is convincing and the audience is moved.<br/><br/>Violence shown is necessary and not gratuitous. It makes you flinch but still hooked on to the screen.<br/><br/>This movie stays with you after you leave the hall. The sign of a good movie. "
1662," JOAQUIN PHOENIX WAS BORN TO BE THE JOKER
"," No disrespect to Heath Ledger (he did great as a joker) but Joaquin did not hold back. The way he carried his character was overwhelming. The movie is a masterpiece. You get to experience all your senses, in a good way. Never seen anything like it. My expectations were already high before watching the movie and after leaving the cinema, the bar was raised. "
1663," Phenomenal
"," I watched last week and 5 days later I can't stop thinking about it. You need to see this wonderful piece of art and revel in it's greatness. The script, story, cinematography, score, direction, costume, sets were all incredible and I haven't even gotten to Joaquin Phoenix's magical and legendary performance as the Joker. This movie is going to consider one of the greatest ever made and rightly so. Astounding work. "
1664," Hi
", Perfect thank you so much it was a great Movie super o 
1665," JOKER IS INCREDIBLE GO WATCH IT NOW!
"," Joker was incredible! The film is a work of Art and Todd Philips should be so proud not only is it an amazing original origin story to one of the greatest villains in history the Joker but the film still manages to tell a story about a person that suffers from Severe mental health issues and how people and society affect someone, it really is a very deep film with many layers and makes you really think, in parts you feel so sorry for Arthur Being bullied by pretty much everyone he comes into contact with, and other parts you are confused and don't know how to feel. "
1666," A dark poetry with its own Composition.
"," Phoenix by all means steals the show. His act is enchanting and draws the viewer into his world. You cannot till end not agree with his actions. The backdrop with its music is excellent and engaging.
But the movie is too dark right from the beginning and many scenes if viewed alone give it a look of horror genre based production.
All in all, it's a dark and surreal poetry with its own composition. "
1667," Brilliant! 10/10
"," Joker... Brilliant!! 10/10.
Joaquin Phoenix... Incredible. If he doesn't get the Oscar then something is terribly wrong.,<br/><br/>Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
It's a disturbing, thought provoking film that has beautiful acting and cinematography and for me is the definitive portrayal of the Joker.<br/><br/>I'll be going again soon.<br/><br/>This isn't a Marvel movie folks so no young ones. "
1668," Time to start deconstructing superheroes
"," Joaquin Phoenix is terrific and so is the film. Just like the era where westerns faded into dystopian anti-westerns, I hope we're going to start deconstructing superhero films. I agree with Martin Scorsese that superhero movies are closer to theme parks than actual cinema. He's nowhere near the first person to say it but he's right nonetheless. I hope we're entering an era in film where superheroes are deconstructed. That would be far more interesting than roller coasters.<br/><br/>Regarding the film, I wouldn't have expected that a deep dive into the failings of our mental health system merging with grass-roots anti-fascist politics would be this compelling but here we are.<br/><br/>I never really cared for Batman - he always seemed to be just a rich guy with expensive toys - so I guess I was open to the message but still, very very good movie (also very violent, don't take the kiddies). "
1669," You have to see it.
"," People should go and see it I think was a master piece I honestly believe that. The acting, the picture, the scenes. I haven't seen anything so disturbing in a long long time. After 30 minutes I was so uncomfortable but at the same time so curious to see what it is going to happen .When I say is disturbing is because it is real, It is not the same Batman films with explosions and unreal mystic powers magic or anything like that. After watching this film you will be more careful about people any people, because mental illness is real and you never know when you will find a psychopath , he or she can be sit next to you. It is a journey how a sick society can destroy humans. BTW the trailers shows nothing about the real film. "
1670," An amazing performance from Phoenix
", An amazing performance from Phoenix as he sways from lucidity to sociopathy. 
1671," Are you laughing at me?
"," Todd Phillips delivers an incredible, unsettling depiction of a unfortunate person living in an unforgiving society. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of his life as the famous Dc Comics character, but so true to real life. Having ninety-five percent of the screen-time ,Joaquin brilliantly rides the edge of insanity leading to an amazing payoff by the end. Shot gorgeously bt Lawrence Sher ;every scene and encounter Arthur Fleck has builds and builds with gripping tension , great dialogue and a eerie sountrack. The run-time of 2hr and 2 min is perfect for this. Being difficult subject matter already , but with enough moments of levity and dark humor to help the rewatch...and yes plenty of Gotham City Easter eggs that are the cherries on the sundae. This film leaves you with a haunting look at a world not too far from our own. Just set in the 1980s. JOKER is the fourth movie based on a comic book that has taken them to the next level. But this is NOT a Superhero film. It is a Drama first and foremost with elements of a thriller and crime movie sprinkled in as Arthur becomes the clown prince of crime: THE JOKER. "
1672," Joker - A Criminal or Victim
"," Best movie saw till date. Joker is that movie which takes you to BTS of villains that Hollywood has never shown. Best part of this movie was it never let you sit calm, because in every single scene some developments are taking place, and mind you not just any developments but the kind that makes you question why in heaven's sake are you agreeing to each and every freaking thing that Joker does. "
1673," Good god damn
"," Holy mother fluffing crab bucket this film is absolutely stunning. I was blown away! It's dark, funny, gritty, uncomfortable and wonderfully shot. This film deserves all of the awards. To all the people walking out because it's offensive to people with mental health please get a grip as someone with mental health difficulties I find it offensive that you are offended on my behalf. Next onto the Gary glitter debate now obviously I do not support the man and find him utterly repulsive but the song is there for a reason or maybe not I don't know i didn't make this movie but my point is are you going to not watch baby driver because Kevin Spacey is cast ? (Probably not). Are you going to stop watching lord of the rings because Harvey Weinstein is attached ? ( Probably not) are TV channels not going to to show certain films because an actor commited a crime (probably not as American beauty was on last week). This film is a work of art and what is art without a bit of controversy? In my opinion Phillips has done a bloody phenomenal job and has people riled up (something the joker would love) well done sir GIVE PHOENIX AN OSCAR !! "

1678," 9.5 if I could, but Joaquin Phoenix easily gets a 10
"," Didn't watch a single preview before seeing it, and I think that made the experience a bit better for me personally as I really had no idea which way the story was going, and with this particular movie that might've been the best scenario because I felt movie took me more along for a ride of the unexpected rather than the traditional and predictable. With prior knowledge of the movie (which probably most people have before their first viewings, especially nowadays) I might have had a much different experience and not have liked it nearly as much. I have a hard time giving anything a 10 or a 0, but if I could I'd give it a 9.5, and since it's clearly getting it's well deserved respect I don't really feel that I need to help slightly boost the consensus rating for this terrific movie that will go down as one of the greatest ever as it's likely to stay right under a 9.0 which would put it higher than almost any other movie rated here. "
1679," Film of the year!
"," What DC managed to pull it off with the Joker is something special. Phoenix's acting is just incredible. Every shot, every score and every bit of acting is magic. A Masterpiece! "
1680," A must watch, not just DC fans, to all the people

There has been a negativity spread of rating from critics, but I assure you- Don't believe that! Joker may not be your taste, but WATCH at least once. I guarantee you you will love the movie. Thank me later. :) "
1681," Excellent movie
"," Tonight, I went to see the movie Joker about the origins of Batman nemesis, as you may have noticed by reading my other entries in this diary, I had extremely high expectations for this film. With so many expectations, I thought it would be difficult for this work to touch me or surprise me. Yet coming out of the cinema I was completely dazzled, by what seems to me to be the best film of the decade. This film deals well with the psychology of the character, he approaches the character as never before, the end and the revelations that are made to me took my breath away. Finally, I hope that Joaquin Phoenix, the actor who plays the Joker probably achieved the performance of his life even outperforming his own interpretation of Commodus in the Gladiator film. In Todd Phillips' film Joker, he presented a performance that pays tribute to the great names in film. I am confident that his role will be honored at the Oscars and other major awards ceremonies. "

1689," They're not encouraging manslaughter, they're defending people like US!
"," Thank you Todd Philips, thanks Joaquin Phoenix, and thanks DC for making and portraying a character like Joker. Yes, WE EXISTS! We are those people who always try to bring happiness to people but turn out to be annoyers. We are people who are born to be bullied. We just need cares, warmth from people, we want to be loved, to be ""kings of comedians"" or idols, but we are always treated like trash or a joke. We need someone who understands us to share our negative thoughts on those days, but no one listens to us. Are we invisible? When I watched the movie, I cried a lot at the theatre, for finally someone noticed people like us and brings it on screen. People felt disgusted at what Joker does, but I feel rather painful. I experienced almost the same things as Arthur, maybe less severe, but it still hurts me everyday! Actually, Joker just takes revenge on his bullies, he didn't kill a colleague that treated him well, it's just a tragedy for him, cuz he cannot stand them anymore. Remember, murders are bad! But have the bullies ever thought of OUR desperation, emotional pain they brought us until they pray us to forgive (other kinds of revenge, not mentioning killing or murder here)? This is a tragedy, but it's also the despair voices of people like us praying for loves and respects! "
1690," Easiest 10/10 I have ever given.
"," Loved this movie. Already booked in for 2nd watch. If Leonardo Dicaprio can, no offence, grunt his way to a long awaited Oscar. Surely Joaquin Phoenix can with his totally flawless protrayal of the Joker. The movie itself is a masterpiece. Not just your average DC Comic film this is totally unique and amazing. "
1691," The laugh suffered
"," ""Joker"" has been causing controversy and boycotts because of its glorification of violence, but the truth is that there is no glorification, not even a pretentious movie or danger as many say, is a movie of acts and consequences, with a character building excellent and exceptional direction, not to mention Joaquim's magical acting, ""Joker"" overcomes any distrust of his artistic factor, is a feature that uses the magic of cinema to tell a powerful and poetic story. Joker's screenplay was conceived by todd Phillips, a filmmaker who has an all-comedy career, and this makes Toddy get a better sense of his character building, of course, the director has a lot of inspiration from movies like ""Taxi Driver"". "","" The king of comedy "","" The worker ""and even"" Indomitable bull ""large majority directed by Scorsese-Who came to participate in the production of the film- and starring de de Niro, which is in the film, ie the young director is coming advised. Despite having a whole cinematic study of what he wanted to do, ""Joker"" doesn't have a perfect script, but comes close to that, his character building is deep and slow, and starts from breaks, we are introduced to a troubled character. and anguish and we have a first act focused on increasing those anguish and problems, then we have the absorption of a kind of social disorder so, in a short third act, the joker is born, it is an impeccable construction that plays between fantasy and reality. , this thin line causes a haze in the viewer's vision that begins to get confused about the social chaos and mood of the protagonist, from this point of view we understand a little Joker, a character broken by the society that accumulates sorrows, his momentum not angry, he's a refuge, he sees his sociopath as something funny, a morbid, subtle and deep transfer of feelings that helps build an atmosfer that of madness and insanity in a grand way, one of the best character builds I've ever seen. We have a critique of governmental abandonment and inefficiency supporting the sick and containing social chaos, the failure of public agencies creates a city prone to violence and chaos making Joker's anguish more easily breed, parental abandonment, lack of figure The paternal feeling that is strongly felt by the character helps him to become unsupported and loose in this sick immersion that all bases, whether family or social, are inefficient in containing his sickening momentum, is a critique of us and the system we have created. Todd Phillips gives a directing show, we knew the filmmaker had some technical talent, for good or bad, the ""If you don't marry drink"" trilogy is very well directed, but here he goes further and completely changes his driving style, his camera is subjective and there is a total mix of styles, sometimes we have a wonderful curious handheld camera that is peeking at the protagonist's metamorphosis, sometimes the cemera is fixed and seeks more ambiguous and open angles, the camera looks sideways, approaches, It moves away, it is a camera that causes a total immersion to the viewer, several are the strange filming we usually see in the cinema, capturing different points and angles of our protagonist, it is as if the camera was afraid of Joker, always contained and little focal, the photograph is impeccable, much like ""Taxi Driver"" we have a greenish, melancholy and dirty photograph, it is a depressing photograph that composes and of life the social anguish of Joker, the Other points are great too, such as the costume and makeup, and of course, we have a magnificent, theatrical, high and high soundtrack that permeates the whole feature, a track that looks like a horror movie, but works great here. Todd Phillips puts Joaquim Phoenix with his hand at the Oscars, at least with a guaranteed nomination, Joaquim does more than just staging, he understands his character, lives him and expresses his anguish and frustrations with frightening liveliness, it's a character delivery impressive, the actor lives his character more than just facially and psychologically, his whole body is shaped Joker's agony, his decomposing physical state, his anomalies, his weight in walking, his difficulty in raising his head, we have a delivery and a bodily and physical act too, it's a complete plunge into the heart of the joker, the actor laughs in a scary way, more so than he laughs, and we feel he's crying, his characterization is great too, unless something extraordinary later this year, Joaquim Phoenix performs impeccably and one of the best performances of recent years. De Niro is also great, it is wonderful to see such an important and remarkable actor for the cinema coming back to perform so well. ""Joker"" was very hypado, this is always detrimental in a movie, but he can meet expectations by creating a reread of movie classics adapted and conjectured into a pop culture character, an immersion in violence, insanity and hurt, a challenge to social isolation and hatred that we cultivate in the society of this always, all aligned to a great acting and direction, the film is not perfect, telegraphs some scenes and at one point underestimates the intelligence of the viewer, but it gets lost in its ocean of merits, ""Joker"" is not a hero movie nor is it for any audience, it is a heavy drama about melancholy and insanity. (Spoilers) = It's hard to say a few things about the movie without giving up events, for example its final dubiousness, where it remains open whether the Joker killed his psychologist, going out of his way and actually turning you into a psychopath or not, and leaving the character alive for a possible future continuation, other details are magnificent too, the dirty construction of the city where at certain times we defied the fact and we question if the city is rotten or we are seeing through the eyes of Arthur, where everything is dirty, The ""little dance"" that Joaquim plays after the first murders is also spectacular, it is a moment where Arthur finds his peace and slowly begins his transfiguration. Another interesting point, which already talks with the film's dark humor, is a joke, perhaps the most profound of the film, which is not spoken by the joker but by the director when he scales De Niro for his film, director Todd Philips is very much mirrored. in several films, some of them are ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Comedy King"" and ""Raging Bull"" all starring De Niro, where he plays a broken character who finds an escape in violence, Todd brings the niro to his feature and kills him through a character who suffers from the same ills, aside from being a sadistic joke, we can interpret it as an allegory, where violence finally returned to De Niro, another interesting point, is that all these films are directed by Scorsese, who was part of the production of the film. "
1692," We Can't decide him!!!
", I give ten star for joker spirit. It isn't acting. MASTERPIECE. love him so much. 
1693," Don't compare Jokers
"," Before its release, I too critically compared Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger (without having seen the movie!). But don't compare Jokers. This film is about Arthur Fleck. And as he transforms into the Joker, you will be dazzled by darkness. This is an awkward, creepy and uncomfortable cinematic experience. Ensure you're willing to explore madness, as you'll likely fall for one of the most enigmatic villains to hit our screens. It's very rare you leave a film screening, yet the film hasn't left you. "
1694," Flawless Masterpiece
",
1695," Excellent movie
"," Everything about this movie was flawless, the music, cinematography, plot and acting. Joaquin Phoenix, as usual, brought the true joker to life with utmost passion and dedication. However, you are gravely mistaken if you go in thinking that this is a cliche action packed superhero movie. This movie is a slower paced story of the origin of one of the most iconic villians in theaters. Overall great film! "
1696," Masterpiece
", It's a masterpiece. It's not for marvel/dc movies fans. 
1697," DC rouges gallery
", If there was ever a doubt about Batman having the best rouges gallery in comics..... This movie will clear your doubts. I seriously thought nobody could match Heath Ledger's last performance as the Joker but Pheonix did a wonderful job. 
1698," Joaquin Phoenix at his finest!
"," I was never interested in comic book movie adaptations be it DC or MCU. But when the trailer for Joker came out, I was actually drawn to it mainly because of Joaquin Phoenix. I've seen a few of his movies and he has always been an amazing actor. But boy he changed the game for this movie. Not one bit of this movie felt boring or empty. Cinematography is outstanding. Dark, gritty and uncomfortable in a satisfying way. This movie is a gift for the audience, and I'm lucky to have experienced it. "
1699," Joke meaning has been change for me after watching this.
"," I have never seen movie like this. Watching this movie it will look like very simple but it is very complex. The direction has made it perfect. ""Acting was marvellous"" "
1700," Wow
"," Todd you are a brilliant man
This was the best movie I have seen even better than the whole marvel universe, the music the acting, Joaquin Phoenix IS the man for it, he IS THE JOKER "
1701," Not the movie I expected and that's the best part.
"," Going into this movie I didn't know what to expect from it. I loved Joker in TDK but was always curious about his past but not too much because of how mysterious he was. I knew it'd be an origin story but wasn't sure how long it'd take for him to fully transform into Joker.<br/><br/>But yet they made it happen and it actually made sense. His motives were realistic and so was his lack of empathy. The transformation is steady and definitely not rushed which I loved, you feel like you're seeing every factor contributing to him becoming Joker.<br/><br/>The costume is great and so is the face paint, it's unique and different to any we've seen in the past which made it refreshing.<br/><br/>Finally, the part I loved the most was the music throughout. The music when he gets home form the subway is so freaky but amazing. Then the change in tone when he walks out of his apartment just gives you goosebumps, the song fits perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall an amazing movie that Joaquin Phoenix deserves a lot of credit for. "
1702," One of the best films and acting performances i have ever seen in my life.
"," Joaquin Phoenix really showed that he is a better joker than Ledger. which is saying A LOT that Heath Ledger had the best performance ever. the film is absolutely incredible with emotional and insane moments that you dont expect. I am a Dc, and Marvel fan and have seen everything. and in my opinion Joker was just as good if not better than The Dark Knight. "
1703," Oscar winning movie
", One of the best movies ever ‚úå oscar worth for phoenix 
1704," A raw and very real movie
", Absolutely brilliant film Oscars abound. It's a very real insight into mental health and the apathy towards it in our society. Phoenix is awe inspiring in his performance as Joker and made it his own in a very real and vulnerable way!! Just sublime to experience.

Joaquin Pheonix nailed the character and his acting bis truly amazing... "
1707," A dark grim masterpiece.
", An unexpected visual treat pointing out the difference between DC and Marvel with nail-biting performance ofJoaquin Phoenix.Love the Scorsese references. 
1708," Oscar worthy performance
"," Joker has always been a controversial character and many have tried and failed to portray him. After the last DC/ Jared Leto epic flop, few believed something good will come out of this project and boy oh boy did Joaquin prove us all wrong. This is an Oscar worthy performance and the film hit ALL the spots. Joker's character has been made relatable and his evil deeds justifiable and that is more scandalous and controversial than any form of violence. Immaculate execution at all times, 5/5, WHAT A FILM. "
1709," Absolutely Fantastic!
"," Just go and see this as soon as you can. Everything about it is perfect. The cinematography is outstanding, with several factors setting the scene perfectly and just the overall performance is oscar worthy. "
1710," Its a must see!
"," All the way through this film I loved it. No point in it did I feel as if it was dragging or too much. It is by far one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend this film but be warned it does deal with mental illness and depression on a whole different scale to which hasn't been touched on before in a film (that I know of).
I would defiantly go see this over and over again. Not much else I can really say without spoiling any of the scenes/plot but just got and see it and make your own mind up. "
1711," One of the best performances of all time.
", I have not felt this disturbed watching a movie in a long time and that is the point of this film. Joaquin Pheonix is brilliant and this is a must see for everyone. Prepare to descend to the voids of madness! 
1712," Masterpiece

1713," The best character analysis of all time
"," I'm just a teenager that watches a lot of movies and enjoys them a ton, and this one might of been the best movies I ever seen. I would call myself somewhat of a movie fanatic and there are many more of me out there but let me tell you, anyone who's says this movie is promoting violence and says it's bad in any way are seriously tripping. Please take it from the bottom of my heart this movie is one of the most influential movies of the century. Just amazing. "
1714," Film of the Year. Phoenix is superb!
"," A truly stunning film. Shown from the perspective of a mentally ill comedian/clown who the viewer is encouraged to empathise with. Shot through with some scenes of shockingly brutal and visceral violence. Joaquin Phoenix has never been better and gives a tour de force performance that fascinates, horrifies and excites the audience. Use of a Gary Glitter song has caused some controversy, but the music perfectly fits the edgy, amoral dichotomy of the character. Believe the hype, go see it. It deserves a hatful of Oscars, especially for JP. "
1715," Spectacular!!!
", Marvellous film with everything you expect from a origin movie with one of the most iconic villain ever adapted from comic to movies really wells. Best joker actor Joaquin Phoenix since Heath ledger joker. Just Wow! 
1716," Amazing! A work of art
", I can't say anything it hasn't been said. This movie is a work of art. Should win 3 Oscars at least. 
1717," Absolutely Amazing Performance
"," Never really been a Joaquin Phoenix fan but his performance in this movie was out of this world! For those that felt this movie was boring completely missed the point, this wasn't intended to be a CGI filled action flick. This movie dove into the madness of a man who then becomes The Joker and JP hit it out of the park, Heath Ledger would've been proud! If you are expecting a Dark Knight film, you will be disappointed. "
1718," Brilliant masterpiece of a film
", Best Joker centered film I have ever seen in my life. Everything about this movie was absolute perfection. I can't think of a single reason why I would take off even 1 point from the perfect 10 that this movie deserves. Brilliant!!! I would watch this again and again and again. This will become a cult classic and will be raved about for years to come. Mark my words. 
1719," An absolute masterpiece
"," One of the best movies I've ever seen. The way they capture his slow decent to darkness is fantastic.<br/><br/>
The ending is perfect setting up the Batman story and truly showing how crazy the joker is.<br/><br/>
You watch him grow more evil and you want him to be good and not do bad things but he does. The brutal murders on the subway and the tv show add to the jokers character development by showing how when he kills someone he feels good and likes it. And all the controversy about this really happening is stupid and everyone who says it needs to grow up and enjoy a perfect movie "
1720," Wow
"," This movie really blew me away. I was expecting it to be good but, not this good. The cinematography is amazing however, it's Joaquin Phoenixes performance is what seals the deal. This movie is one of the best movies I've seen. 10/10 well done WB, Todd Phillips, and DC. "
1721," A worthy origin story for an such an iconic character.
"," Joker movie is a clinic on what quality filmmaking is. Just to be clear I'm speaking from an artistic standpoint, not a political one. Seriously this movie was awesome. Top to bottom, outstanding. If this doesn't clean up at the Oscars then there's seriously a flaw in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences. Phoenix was hauntingly brilliant and so was the photography and score. Even down to the noisy film grain effect. Incredibly well done. Outstanding. "
1722," One of the best movies I've seen
", Joaquin Phoenix presents his character perfectly. This is the perfect way to create an origin story. 
1723," Masterpiece of how the joker was born
",
1724," Somehow able to exceed expectations
"," Amidst all the hype and controversy, Joaquin Phoenix shines as bright as this film is dark. The score perfectly sets the mood and acts as an eerie backdrop to the film throughout. The plot is revealed from the story and doesn't rely on narration to carry the film. You can tell Joaquin Phoenix did his homework, his portrayal of a mentally ill man struggling to survive in a time of economic hardship is masterful. He is supported by a well selected cast, including the best depiction of Bruce Wayne seen on screen. They didn't reduce Dante Pereira-Olson's Bruce into a whining bratty child as many incarnations usually do. The movie mixes the plight of our down on his luck protagonist and provides an in depth look into the current sociologic climate, without weighing down the film. An excellent blend of comic accuracy and realism is used to create something comic fans and movie fans without knowledge of the character can both enjoy. "
1725," Phenomenal
"," As if there were any doubt that Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors of his generation. He absolutely knocks it out of the park in this one, with the help of great directing, cinematography, score, writing, supporting cast, etc. Everything in this movie is extremely well done.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this whole movie is how it can make you understand a little bit better how someone would turn into the Joker. I've heard about the controversy this movie has faced and it's no surprise, I mean every movie in 2019 has to be controversial due to outrage culture. I won't go into the obvious argument that video games and movies are not to blame for whatever horrible, violent acts people commit. It just seems that we've been having this discussion and at this point it's almost like beating a dead horse. I will say this, though. At several points in the movie I UNDERSTOOD why Arthur turned to a life of crime. The movie does a fantastic job at putting the viewer in the shoes of this man, and honestly, I did feel pretty bad for him at several times during the film, which is a big reason why you UNDERSTAND where he's coming from. The first three guys he kills in the subway, I get why did it and at some level I can almost say they maybe even deserved it and besides you could almost say that it was in self-defense and he did not want to kill them. However, when he did, he enjoyed it, and there's when the trouble starts. Besides him killing to PROTECT HIMSELF, I will say at no other point in the movie did I CONDONE his actions. So the point I'm trying to make here, is just because a film makes you UNDERSTAND how someone would turn into a psycho, doesn't mean you are going to become one yourself and it certainly doesn't mean you think this behavior is acceptable. This is not the first film to do it and it will not be the last. As a matter of fact, I think this film's biggest and clearest inspiration, Taxi Driver, is a much more brutal, violent movie than this. I will say this is the biggest one of two things I didn't love about the movie, that it just seems to similar in the way the story progresses to Taxi Driver, especially during the first few minutes of the film. The word ""garbage"" is extensively used and there are also giant rats in Gotham, which just gives the movie that feeling of a dirty, violent city with an alienated protagonist who continues on this path of isolation until he does some pretty extreme stuff.<br/><br/>The other little thing I didn't love is really a nitpick, but I think the ending should have just cut to black after he says ""You wouldn't get it"" after picturing Bruce Wayne standing above his dead parents. I think that ending would have fit more accordingly with the dark themes and overall feel of the film, rather than playing some Frank Sinatra music. But, like I said, this is just a nitpick. This is a fantastic movie, featuring one of the best performances I have seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix knocks it out of the park, De Niro is also really great, his final scene in the movie, as Arthur reveals to him that he killed those people in the subway, his voice and the look on his face start to have some subtle changes, as if you can tell he's affected by these facts, but he still has to put on a show for the audience. Wonderful movie, go watch it and make up your own mind about it. "
1726," Perfection
"," The best performance I've seen from an individual actor combined with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen also. So perfectly dark, sinister and crazy! I doubt there will ever be a more perfect joker in any film of this doesn't win multiple oscars it will be a travesty. "
1727," The greatest piece of cinematography I have ever seen
"," This film will go down in history. Simply amazing. The whole team behind this film should be commended, as well as proud of what they have produced. Throughout the years there are many films which simply come from Hollywood and satisfy viewers but are predictable with limited long lasting impact. This is not one of those films, you will walk out of Joker with your head in the stars, unable to Express what you have just seen. Joaquin delivers the best character portrayal I have ever seen, displaying the transition from Arthur Fleck to the Joker right the way through the film. I found myself smiling at his ability to deliver a perfect personality and mannerisms which we saw from Ledger, and although Heath gave us an amazing foundation when creating his Joker, I honestly believe Joaquin has made Heath proud. I don't believe I will see a film of this capacity for a very long time, and it is almost certain the film will win best actor and best director come the Oscar's in 2020. "
1728," Excellent
", A masterpiece. Excellent filming and acting. One of the best movies in a while.

""Put on a happy face"" "
1730," Outstanding Movie; Very Realistic Story Line
"," This movie opens up what goes into the mind of a troubled person. Scenes and circumstances is very relatable for the viewers and you can really feel how messed up Joker's life was prior to being Joker. In real life, these things happen behind the scene. While everyone thought everyone should be happy, there are times that life will not allow you to be. To be honest, the story line itself could trigger a lot of things. It could encourage people to stand up for themselves but the ""how"" of it will depend on the people. Truly, Joker set a high bar for other super hero movies. It showed the dark side of reality and the selfishness of humanity. "
1731," Incredible!
"," Joaquin Phoenix played the role of the 'Joker' amazingly, he absolutely deserves an Oscar for his performance. It is a compelling Villian. A dark, disturbing and sinister feel was certainly created throughout the film, which is exactly what I wanted to see!<br/><br/>The combination of the cinematography and mise en scene with the acting worked incredibly well. This is almost solely due to the fantastic acting quality. You will stay immersed throughout the entirety of the movie and the dark plot adds to this.<br/><br/>It is one of the best movies I have seen in a while! I will give the movie a 9/10! "
1732," This is not a superhero film
", Outstanding film. Acting was superb and this was a complete breath of fresh air compared to the other bang bang woo super hero films with zero depth. Joquin is an outstanding actor.

"," The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, the cinematography is beautiful, and the music is embedded in the film as I've never seen or heard before. The film indeed makes you feel unpleasant, scared and anxious, but why some people think that's a bad thing? It just demonstrates how good this movie is, immersing you in the story from begging to end. The fact that you sympathize with a mistreated person only makes you human, It has nothing to do with agreeing with violence. On the contrary, it makes you realize how we should be more compassionate, and care about other people. "

1739," Wow just wow
"," Joaquin Phoenix is every bit as good as Heath Ledger in the character, simply a masterpiece by Todd Phillips, J.J Abrams needs to get Phillips on board to assist fixing the DCEU "
1740," Surreal experience....
"," I don't write reviews too often for films I see however as much as I didn't expect much coming into this movie I left with a profound sense of awareness of society around us and just what may set off certain people in such a violent manner after years of taking abuse from others and often for no other reason than careless spite and taking pleasure in someone else's misery.
The movie is truly a social statement more than anything else that many may find odious or hard to swallow but one doesn't have to look far to see how the film speaks to a lot of truths we'd rather ignore and make excuses for.
As for Joaquin Phoenix I never had much of an opinion of his acting abilities but this movie has certainly heightened his standing in my view and rivals if not surpasses Heath Ledger's portrayal in 2008. "
1741," A Masterpiece.
"," Many reviews here describe the movie as being: amazing, brilliant, a masterpiece and a work of art. None of those descriptions are wrong. The Joker is an extremely dark, powerful look into the mind of a man quickly descending into his own madness and inability to cope with the harsh, cruel world that surrounds him. In a cinematic world that's currently dominated by comic book movies laced with humour and CGI FX, it's ironic that a movie about The Joker provides none of that, but instead is the most serious and real of them all. "
1742," 10/10
"," Unbelievable 10/10, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was so intense and uncomfortable, keeping me on the edge of my seat "
1743," Best Joker Yet At Least For Me
"," This is a hell of a tale with some questions raised about today's tendency to ignore the mentally ill people in our society by the lack of specialised care for individuals.who need 24 hour treatment
What a performance by the lead man it slowly draws you in and you follow his unfortunate story to become the Supervillain we all know.
It is worth seeing this film and watch a master at work bringing a different version of the joker to the big screen .The cinematography is great ,colourful and moody and the soundtrack just works alongside the gritty visuals
So many twists explain why he becomes the man he does I am not going to spoil anything .
Joaquin Pheonix is my favourite actor and never disappoints but he has gone a step up here in portraying a very mentally challenged character here .and deserves his acting to be rewarded "
1744," Comic book character brought to life...
"," Needless to comment on Phoenix's performance, he delivered brilliantly as expected.
In my case the apocalypse of the film was the director, the way he built the Joker out of real life material is really astonishing.
I'll be watching for Todd Phillips's next steps. "

The look of the film was beautiful and certainly gave the film an extra edge!
Hoping to see the joker come face to face with the batman in the future!! "

The best film I have seen in a long time. "
1749," A must see for anyone who appreciates movies as art.
"," The best movie I have seen in a decade it is thought provoking. Phoenix completely sold the role as joker, while not a horror film the joker was almost physically painful to watch with his perfect delivery. At no point does the movie treat you like an idiot as it flows from moment to moment without any unneeded moments.<br/><br/>The movie would stand firmly on its own two legs even if it didn't have the DC connections it's that powerful of a narrative<br/><br/>The fight club of our generation. "

1755," The best movie of the year
"," The cinematography, the acting, and the amazing writing that created this movie has put it on the top compared to everything else that I've seen this year. I empathize with the Joker because of his kindness and decency, it makes him almost lovable and relatable. His decent into madness is also understandable because despite being medicated ,heavily, to advert feelings of sadness and despair, he still feels that his unfortunate life has no meaning and people are just unreasonably cruel. Joker has a natural need to be seen and respected, like all humans; when he gets the chance to do what he believes is his calling, bringing happiness and laughter into the world through comedy, he is mocked and criticized nationally by someone he idolizes. Which impart brings about the recognition he dreamed of but the brightest light that shines upon him is unfortunately for the pure ridicule of his performance as a comedian. The aftermath of his instant stardom proves to the world the insane and twisted individual he truly is. Which emboldens the maniacal the star he's destined to be. "
1756," such a cult film

1757," This movie was awesome
", I just watched the movie yesterday and it was awesome and its because not only this movie is a about a villain and the story but it's about a person with a mental illness that is trying to find himself in a society where everything is a mess.

I really hope this movie wins the oscar cause it is well deserved..

"," A truly phenomenal performance, more than worthy of an oscar. A fantastically disturbing portrayal of a person, place and time. Definitely an absolute Must-see! "
1767," Amazing
"," Masterpiece, great acting by Phoenix, great movie 10 out 10 "
1768," Outstanding
"," The more I think about this movie, the more I appreciate it. Quentin Tarantino'ish without the comedy. Long and drawn out at times, but necessary to really set the mood.<br/><br/>Fantastically well done, with an Oscar winning performance by Jaoquin Phoenix! I don't think I need to say anything more. "
1769," Great standalone movie
"," First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.<br/><br/>It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!<br/><br/>I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good. "
1770," Joker is a masterpiece
", Joker is a brilliant piece of film making and an instant classic it will be spoke about for years to come and is officially my favourite film and will be watching it more and more as the years go by and carry on getting mesmerised by the great performances score and choreography in this gritty character study 10/10 
1771," The Joker of our time
"," What an experience. At first I did not want to believe the hype. I avoided the trailers and wanted to experience this movie with a fresh mind. And what an absolute pleasure it was watching it.<br/><br/>The movie beautifully and elegantly captures the perfect portrait of the Joker of our time. All the Jokers we had were portrayed to their timeline. And today, where mental illness is relevant in our society, this is the perfect adaptation of the Joker in our time.<br/><br/>You cannot compare Heath Ledger's joker with Joaquin Phoenix's. Both had incredible performances, but Phoenix's joker is different. This is not the criminal mastermind we are used to. This Joker is broken and shattered.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best movie of the year. I wouldn't be surprised of this movie got nominated, as well as Phoenix's performance "
1772," A masterpiece that Joaquin deserves a bow for!
"," Oh, what an experience it was to watch this legend perform such a challenging role! He didn't just act, he brought Joker to life. There was not a second where I found the movie to be boring. It had my full attention so much so that I couldn't look away from the screen.
My favorite part was the descend of Arthur into Joker on the stairs. I just couldn't help but laugh at Joaquin extraordinary talent and the efforts he put in.
Truly a masterpiece that I hope many people witnessüëèüèª "
1773," Enter the mind of a psychopath
", An intense experience. Not a feel good movie but the movie accomplishes it's objectives in a way few can. Don't listen to the critics - this is a true masterpiece that will linger within you. 
1774," Outstanding.
"," Joker delivers what it promises and more. A twisted tale of a sick man corrupted by a decadent society. It's clear the script was carefully written, and Phillips directed the hell out of it. Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's work also stands out, the music is as ominous and dark as the film itself. Finally Phoenix's performance as Arthur is something else, absolutely remarkable and Oscar-worthy. He carries the whole film on his shoulders with his performance, totally different from Ledger's but as riveting and astonishing.
Joker shows us more about the man behind the makeup, still it doesn't make anything entirely clear, forcing you doubt and rethink to everything you see. And that sometimes dangerous ambiguity is for the better in the movie, for it is carried out masterfully. "
1775," Am I a Joker to you?
"," This is not some average villian movie in which you hate the main character. You feel sorry for Arthur and his condition and you get angry because society destroys him additionally. Throughout the movie you sympathize with him, you understand his actions and thoughts. Afterall, he is just like us - he doesn't want to be a joke to this society. And so he became the Joker.
Joaquin gave us the best of him with his dancing, laughing, crying and even muscle cramping. Each of his sentences, each laugh and reaction makes you feel something. It was really an emotional and exceptional performance which is to be enjoyed to the fullest. "
1776," Best movie ever

In 2019, Joker and Once upon a time in hollywood are my favorite movies. "
1781," Everything i wanted
"," So much hype, so much to live up too. And for me it delivered. An amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a gripping story to go with it. I was gripped from the first line, and didnt move at all till the end. It has amazing suspense, and some pretty violent and disturbing scenes, but it all creates an amazing film that fans of the DC universe will love. There is not many films would consider giving a top rating, but this is definitely a contender. "
1782," Thank you Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix
",
1783," When the system goes :O seeing their own product in action
",
1784," Masterpiece!!!
", Awesome acting &amp; brilliant plot connection with the original story! 
1785," a real masterpiece
"," This movie hits hard, it'll shock you to the core and open your eyes to the horrible and cruel world we live in, nothing in this movie not even the interview scene felt over the top, fiction or comic-book-like, it can happen anytime and to anyone, the movie shows us that the joker could be anyone of us who after a life of struggling and abuse logically slips into madness.
Joaquin is a true genius and they better give him an Oscar, I mean if they can give it to the ridiculous super boring role of DiCaprio in the reverent they should give it to this sheer brilliance. "
1786," Out of the darkness the joker is born
"," First off I have to say this is one of my favourite films of the year.
Joaquin Phoenix plays a great portrayal as Arthur Fleck the man who in turn becomes the Joker, trying to fit into society and let down by society and Joaquin should win an Oscar for his performance in the film.<br/><br/>Other reviews giving low scores saying it's not a joker film and not like Leto or Ledger. Each actor adds their stamp to a role as this isn't what Joaquin has done plus this movie is set before Arthur becomes the joker so it's all the back story leading up to the finale and the birth of the joker.<br/><br/>People giving this film poor votes must not appreciate the film and yes it's a dark film but it portrays life and life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.<br/><br/>I'd certainly go back to the cinema for a second viewing "
1787," Loved it.
"," It was well done, no doubt about it and Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job with his performance in Joker. What really grabbed me was the cinematography, it was visually spectacular! I loved the style. It felt like it was filmed in the 70's on 35mm when films had that ""look"". I really enjoyed watching it on the big screen. It was a treat of eye candy. "
1788," THE Joker and more !!!
"," Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for Best Actor at next year's Oscars unless Daniel Day Lewis comes out of retirement and does something truly extraordinary. This film will bridge the gap between comic book geeks and serious cineastes because of his performance and the direction of Todd Philips. Never has Gotham looked so exhausted as it does here. No surprise that it is Joker's breeding ground. Helpless and hopeless, no wonder that he turns against the ""haves"".
The Joker has proved an iconic role. Just as we talk about Olivier's Henry V or Karloff's Monster or Chaney's Lenny, in the future we will be looking at Phoenix and saying ""yes,it's his defining role"". His speech, his body shape, his eyes - all come together to chill you to the bone. Yet there is poignancy there and inevitability and anarchy. The best film of 2019 with nothing to beat it unless Abrams pulls something out of the hat with ""The Rise of Skywalker"". "
1789," I hope this film gets what it deserves
"," I was utterly blown away by this film. After all the hype and rave reviews I was not expecting it to live up to expectations, but not only did it live up to them, it exceeded them. This film is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen with a powerful message with the last 20 minutes possibly being the greatest piece of cinema I've ever seen. If Joaquin Phoenix does not at least get nominated for this film, then there truly is something wrong with society. "
1790," Joker my Favourite character!
"," Phoenix smashed it as a Joker!
Surely this is 2019 movie of the year for me, somehow doesn't feel like story from the comic highlighting real issues in the world. "
1791," What a Brilliant Film.
",
1792," Phoenix rising
"," Joker is a human origin story that dispels the mystery behind the character known only as 'The Joker', or Jack Napier in the rarely referenced comic book lore. In this adaptation, it's a downtrodden Arthur Fleck.
To me, this is not a comic book movie, it feeds into what is ultimately a comic book creation, but it offers a gritty realism that makes even 'The Dark Knight' look pretty.<br/><br/>These are the days before the Batman dons the mask to save Gotham from itself, but 'Joker' shows how the vigilante may just be settling a longstanding debt that has come back to haunt the Wayne family, it even may suggest why Batman is merciful of The Joker - you'll see just how Batman's greatest nemesis was created - and it will surprise you to great effect; even if it differs from the traditional origin story. Some critics suggest this movie hasn't much to say, but in the context of the overarching Batman story, it absolutely does.<br/><br/>It traded the notorious chemical incident and Chelsea smile for something perhaps a little less far-fetched - 'Joker' acknowledges the Batman universe, but the focus is very much on the concept and character that embodies the infamous clown and how the mask is a representation of chaos that can easily be spread, just as a mask can be used for justice. It's the Joker's turn in the limelight, as the Waynes are pushed to near minor characters, and cast in the shadow of moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>Did you know that although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention? This movie fittingly gives a nod to this part of the character's past in its closing scenes.<br/><br/>The movie also offers an explanation for The Joker's hysterical laughing; what was once a tragedy became a comedy - and the rest is history.<br/><br/>While fresh concepts carry this movie beyond the box office, it was slow in parts, and lacked a breadth of characters and locations. There weren't many grand sweeping shots of the Gotham landscape. There also weren't many subplots or cutaways to other characters, this isolated the plot into almost entirely Phoenix, where I feel there could have been opportunities to bring in other characters and perspectives.<br/><br/>I disliked the subplot with Sophie Dumond as it didn't add much to the story, and also felt as if Arthur's character could have been more eccentric, instead some of his scripting was jarring, perhaps deliberately so - there needed to be more one-liners to reflect the Joker's natural wit and flair, although his outright strangeness was captured quite well, if a bit excessively.<br/><br/>This movie delivers a solid punchline, 7.6/10. "
1793," Not a movie for everyone but a masterpiece nonetheless.
",
1794," I felt for this character from the first scene
"," I was unsure as to how this movie would play out but I am pleased at the outcome to say the least.<br/><br/>This origin story is the best to date, the writing, score and acting stand out to me as just awesome. The desperate nature of Arthur's life as he struggles to live in a torn city between the rich and the poor shows us how a person may be driven over the edge by the cruelty of the city they live in.
I can certainly see how this movie would relate to so many out there today, and how the distance between the have and have nots is unfair as it has ever been.
By the end of the movie it seemed inevitable that the environment he has lived in his whole dismal life has turned him into the most crazy vilian ever, and how crazy he becomes when he finds a purpose in life that he never had before.<br/><br/>Well done, "
1795," Give Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar for Christ sake!!!
", He is an absolute legend in this film. He deserves all the praise in the world for this chilling performance. The movie itself is not only just a great comic book but a great movie in general. This is a movie that is going to change comic book films for the next 10 years. And I stand by that statement<br/><br/>Final rating: 9.2/10 
1796," Phoenix reaches Ledger and Nicholson level status
"," If Phoenix doesn't win Best Actor, I'll be disappointed. I went in expecting a movie for teenage boys and came out riveted and stunned. It literally sent chills up and down my spine like the first time hearing ""Eruption"" by Van Halen or ""Stairway to Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin. The Joker as reimagined by Phoenix was a tough act to follow. Yet, he equals Jack and Heath &amp; surpasses them both in some ways. This film is worthy of viewing repeatedly. I'm a crusty, old 48 year old, who was 18, when the original Batman played by Nicholson was brand new. "
1797," A stunning artistic achievement - DC at its peak
",
1798," EXCELLENT!!!
", Just finish watching the movie and it was excellent! Joaquin Phoenix played the role to perfection. The best Joker yet in my opinion. 
1799," Best movie of 2019
"," Ignore all the critics, this is one of the best comic book movies ever made. We finally have a portrayal of the Joker that can hold a candle to Heath Ledger's performance in the Dark Knight. "
1800," You will not laugh!
"," This movie was one of a kind. Was it all real? Was it in his head? Was some real and some imagined? How did he really end up in the asylum? So many questions and so many different answers. It keeps you thinking, all while telling a truly original story. This is acting at its finest, blended so adequately with details and background to provide a thriller on a scale very rarely seen. WELL DONE! 10/10 "

1803," Absolutely Brilliant
"," This was one of the best films I've seen in more than a decade. The character development was amazing and Joaquin was nothing short of spectacular. It wasn't what I expected and that was refreshing. It's a human experience and is relevant to our society, as sad as that is. I was thinking about this film for days after I viewed it. Thought provoking. Tragic and insightful. A must see. "
1804," Brilliant, Mesmerizing Performance and perfect direction
"," Joker was a movie that comes along only so often and completely blows you away. You could hear a pin drop in our full theater. Joaquin had Ana amazing, Oscar worthy performance and I can't believe Todd Phillips directed the Hangover movies but now accomplished this.<br/><br/>It's as disturbing as Requiem for a Dream if you've seen that, not the most disturbing movie I've ever seen (2008's Martyrs takes the cake) but this is up there! And it is depressing as well but there are moments of laughter. I don't want to give anything away but if you have a tolerance for something a little more disturbing, I promise this is worth your time!<br/><br/>The websites saying it sucks are snowflake pansies that don't want to watch anything that might ""offend"" sensitive people. Nonsense. Go see it! "
1805," Todd Phillips Masterpiece
"," When you leave a film thinking, asking questions, feeling emotionally hours later. Then realize that the movie has done it's job. "
1806," Wow! Just Wow! This is one for the ages 100/10
"," I was riveted the whole time. Guys, its worth your time and money to go see it. Only shocking thing was that there were many very small children in my screening. I thought the parents were either ignorant or irresponsible. Of course the kids were all bored &amp; starting distracting patrons. Parents, please! "
1807," A masterpiece.
",
1808," Did you laugh?
"," People in my viewing laughed. Above all of the themes explored in this film, from a troubled man emboldened by the very society he abhors, this affected me the most about this film. A dwarf trapped in an apartment with a brutal psychopath is funny to you? Scary times we live in indeed, mirrored by this movie. Phoenix sensational. Can't wait for part 2 and the batman that has to take his monster joker down. "
1809," Great Film!
"," Wow! Truly impressed, nothing more to say.<br/><br/>To Slate, Associated Press, IndieWire, TIME, and all these idiots who call themselves ""film critics"" - GFK yourselves. No wonder ""journalism"" are on decline these days, it simply don't reflect people's true opinion anymore. If it not PC garbage, it's no good to them. "
1810," Joaquin Phoenix for the win!
",
1811," Enough Said!
"," Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
All I have are negative thoughts.
Everybody is awful nowadays.
It is enough to make anyone crazy.
Everybody yells and screams to each other.
Nobody is civil anymore.
Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy.

RIP Heath ledger 
1813," Haunting and wonderful.
"," This is not an easy watch, but it sure as Hell is a rewarding one.<br/><br/>Phoenix hits it out of the park as Arthur Fletch and his descent into madness is a display like no other. The supporting cast are superb, the soundtrack is phenomenal, I really can't find a bad word to say about this film. It's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's a slow burn, but that works really well for the tale the movie tells. When it does ramp up, it really ramps up, with the final act being a terrifying thrill ride.<br/><br/>The feeling I got watching this film was reminiscent of watching Breaking Bad through for the first time. It was uncomfortable, but extraordinary, and I couldn't look away from start to finish.<br/><br/>10/10, outstanding. "

", I saw this last night and agree 100% with the fellow who saw it at TIFF. This is indeed a masterpiece and Joaquin's performance was absolutely stunning! I also agree that it is the best actor performance since Heath Ledger's Joker. I can't stop thinking about this film. It draws you in even after leaving the theatre nearly 24 hours later!

To turn a bad guy into such a well liked character is such a hard thing to do. The twists and turns had me gasping in my seat. Absolutely must see! "
1820," Absolutely BREATHTAKING movie and role play by Joaquin Phoenix
"," First of all, let me say that I cannot emphasize enough how mind blowing this movie is. I don't know how I am supposed to enjoy a movie after this, it just won't be as good.
But let's get into it. It has been a long time since I hadn't watched a DC movie in which the scenario and the role play took over the actions and the commercial frills. This movie is realistic. It reflects the reality of a society that we might live in someday in the near future. I was also iBut the real asset of this masterpiece is Joaquin Phoenix. I don't want to fall into unfair comparisons with Heath Ledger, for the latter has had the chance to have a whole movie centered on his character. However, I just cannot imagine a more genuine, breathtaking performance as Joaquin's. I was in total admiration on each of his scenes and Joker laughs. He nailed them all. Also, the evolution of his character all along makes each segment of the movie more intense and more mind blowing than the previous.
If you're not a comic fan, this movie can easily lead you to it. It gives you chills. It's an absolute masterpiece that's not ready to be topped. "
1821," Phenomenal
", It was the best movie I have seen in 2019. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely crushed it. It is a wonderful piece of art. The musical score is also phenomenal and works with the movie really well.

1825," A villain that you will emphasize with
"," During my whole life, with no exaggeration, i never saw such a perfect movie like Joker. Every aspect in the movie is not only perfectly embedded, it's a masterpiece on its own. Acting, music, picture, storyline, dialog, all these aspects was perfectly merged to get us such an intense movie, where The main character feelings hit directly our hearts. Joker has raised the bar. "
1826," One of the best movies of all time.
"," This movie has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, it is disturbing, it makes you feel uneasy, Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. "
1827," This movie is not for everyone
"," Joker is one of the best movies in history.Phoenix did an intense performance , probably his best after Ring of Fire. I was not surprised why the critics were giving it poor ratings. Because it is criticism which creates the jokers in our society. "
1828," TRUE MASTERCLASS
"," Joaquin Phoenix At his very best. I understand movie is perfect, cinematography, effects, sound and character but Joaquin proves that he is a god level actor! "
1829," Sick movie in a good way.
"," First time writing a comment here but I just had to. The hype surrounding is real and well deserved. I won't comment story of the movie or effects, I'll just say that the acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top performance. His acting of sick crazy man a Joker is looks unbelievable real, you watch him and you feel uncomfortable how real it seems, in some moments you just feel sorry for the poor sick person and you want to look away from the screen. Joaquin did his best in becoming the Joker, he lived this role without a flaw. "

"," JOAQUIN PHOENIX, GOOD LORD! What a performance! Best portrayal of the real Joker in my opinion. Movie does an awesome job in showing why Joker became a Joker and what lead to it.

", An instant classic. Such an intense and beautyfull film. Stop reading reviews and go watch it. 
1838," Watching Joker in New York City
"," Joaquin's performance is 10-star. You can tell the directing helps stylize his performance, especially the body movement, the dance, and the micro-expression. Cinematography is nostalgic, beautiful, with a perfect sense of desperation and rebirth. Some parts (like the date part) try a bit too hard. The change of mindset is painful but gradual and convincing.<br/><br/>And regarding its story, it feels weirdly realistic watching JOKER in NYC. I've seen the filthy streets in the shadow of the vibrant theaters. I've seen the homeless crying laughing on the train, while the suits standing on the other side. During the blackout, I saw people standing on Fifth Avenue, hopelessly waiting for the never-coming bus while some others driving home in Ferrari. I've seen people having dinner in fancy restaurants whose backdoors are home to the homeless. Isn't NYC at an early stage of Gotham? "
1839," extraordinary! IMHO, one of the BEST films EVER made in cinema history.
"," Well......just when I thought ...Once Upon A Time In Hollywood....had it all sewn up....this jem comes along....IMHO.......Oscars are now...up for grabs. Phoenix is exceptional....what a masterpiece. Phoenix was sooooo exceptional In the role of this poor tortured man Arthur, and his absolutely horrid treatment by others......when he was just trying to do the best he could....that it made me cry and my heart hurt for him. I just wanted to pound the crap out of those people, and I am not a violent person. I will see this gem more than once....even tho it rips my heart out.....<br/><br/>I have now seen this masterpiece 5 times....and will probably see it again. .....actually glad I am not the only one saying this..... This film always leaves me numb and my heart hurting for this poor tortured soul. ..and the indecent way he was treated his entire miserable life....which ultimately led to this. But, thats ok, because at least I know I have one. I just wanted to hold him and tell him its going to be ok....IMO, this is movie perfection. Phoenix deserves the OSCAR for this masterful performance. If he does not win for this...just cancel them from now on....because they would be meaningless. "
1840," DC's Dark Game Changer
"," This film was everything I wanted it to be and more. DC should stop trying to do what Marvel has and capitalise on this realistic R-rated style and tone for their films. Not many people could pull off a convincing Joker for an entire film, and neither did Phoenix. This film is about Arthur's transformation, he doesn't fully become Joker until the very end of the film.
This is the story of a man's descent into madness done in the most realistic way possible, taking little inspiration from source material and focusing on what makes the character at his core so polarising.
Aside from the incredible acting, the cinematography, score and pacing of the film married perfectly with Phoenix's take. No screen time was wasted, everything that happened had a purpose or a meaning.
The inclusion of the Waynes in the story was a surprise but a welcome one.
Laying the groundwork for the upcoming Matt Reeves Batman film potentially.
I truly do hope we get to see Phoenix do Joker properly in a future film, but for now I hope this is the catalyst to start the DC Dark series with more films in this realistic R-rated style and tone made for adults and not kids. "

", What is the issue with the violence in this movie? Is it really just being blown up because of the Aurora Dark Knight incident? Honestly the violence in this movie was tame next to the real point. A character study of a character that has been around for 50+ years...just go see this movie and realize how awesome it is and leave the politics at home. Lets get back to appreciating art and not condemning something for its alleged ties to the violence in Aurora 
1846," MUST SEE MASTERPIECE
"," I went to the cinema with expecting that this movie was gonna be good. It wasn't, it was beyond amazing. If you're a DC and a Joker fan you're gonna have an orgasm during the film, if not you're still going to have a great time. I went to watch it with people who knew little to nothing about the character and they loved it too. Been a long time fan of both Joaquin and the Joker, hope the movie gets multiple Oscar nods. AND don't listen to critics, someone once said ""critics are the people who never made it in the film industry"". "
1847," IM DA JOKA BABY!
"," From all of the kinos Joaquin Phoenix has been apart of, he can still give performances that secedes and compliments each role by unlocking the human experience. You're not supposed to feel empathy towards an autistic psychopath (incel), but Phoenix's adaptation of The Joker gives a nuanced perspective towards the cliched archetype. Critics who fear that this film will incite violence and inspiration towards the incel community are right. Had it been any other actor up for the role, they would have not touched the downtrodden so easily. 10/10 BNM "
1848," All hail Joaquin
", The movie is superb. You can witness great acting great direction exceptional cinematography and awesome story writing. You cant blink your eyes for one second and some of the scenes are so beautifully managed.<br/><br/>Lots of love for this movie and rooting Joaquin for oscar 
1849," He is dope of actors man
", It's a cult movie for joker fans ......climax made me standing ovation man..you can't skip this movie at all....movie has too much depth about humans I don't tell more watch the movie please 
1850," Masterpiece
"," Outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix and amazing cinematography (pay attention to the details: colors, emotions, etc). The story was told in a way we can't predict what's next. With no cliches, I consider this movie a hell of a masterpiece. "
1851," After age's
"," Those type of dark movies comes after ages's. Comparison between Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger was disgrace for their skills. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely wonderful as Joker. And the best thing is that the movie didn't leave its plot. In short the movie is wonderfully created please go out and watch its just 10 on 10.
Thanks "
1852," Method acting at it's best!
"," It's going to take me a few more viewings to grasp this movie, which already tells me that it's a masterpiece. "
1853," Masterpiece!
", Joaquin Phoenix best performance to date. This movie is genius. Must see. 
1854," Epic! Phoenix is now inmortal!
"," The screenplay is by far the best of the movie, it was tailored to Phoenix, and he embraced as a real master. Even if you think expectations are going to affect your journey trough this movie, don't worry about it, is just better that you might ever think. A new cult movie has born and a legendary performance takes place, you can see how Joker borns a one of the best actors of its generation gives you the performance of his life. "
1855," Masterful.
", Remarkable direction and excellent acting. We need more films similar to this. 
1856," PERFECTION!
"," This movie is a complete masterpiece of film making. Phoenix pulls off by far THE BEST Joker performance of all time. Ledger can't even come close to how good this is.
The cinematography and the music score were outstanding and nicely fit the performance that was delivered.<br/><br/>Just pure perfection!!! "
1857," Phenomenal piece of cinematography
"," This is a movie you hope it will never end. The man is struggling to stay in the reality, but failed. How the angle of camera, the music, the light and the acting from Phoenix drive you, a little, into madness. It's a pretty dark movie showing a man drive into sanity and you will love it. A pretty good movie. I will see it again soon. "
1858," Best mental health related movie ever
"," This movie, this actor and overall execution was superb.<br/><br/>Illness of the society is impecable pictured. This movie should be discussed to Annalise the cancer of our modern society "
1859," Real World Problems
"," Wow! The problems of real world and how they darken our souls.<br/><br/>Some of the problems he was dealing with hit very close to home and I can easily understand the rage each of us can feel when confronted with society's hierarchy and how some of us are treated like we're disposable. When that rage is combined with mental illness, it ignites a flame in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie also creates a very believable origin story for the Joker. Very good. Go and see it. "
1860," Almost perfect
"," A couple of off parts in the sense of the age gap between joker and Bruce Wayne, the death of Thomas Wayne may be slightly off but needed to suit the movie.
the story in the way of getting to known the joker was perfect. You feel both sympathy and fear. The 2 hours flew by.
Overall a must watch for everyone not only comic book fans "
1861," The great movie
", The film is very beautiful and will not be repeated and the performance of Joaquin is legendary 
1862," Masterpiece (but could be deadly)
"," What everyone said.
But one last thing, I thing what made this film to unbelievably brilliant is that it was somehow believable. And I don't think ""Batman"" stands up to this kind of monster, because it's a very real monster that lives and grows within our society.
A man who of a tortured soul who has been rejected by the world now wants to tear down the structure of being in the world and everything in it.
And I think there's something inspiring about the joker - and there's the danger because there are people who have been forgotten by the world, rejected by their fathers, bullied and laughed at, born with health and psychological problems, abused and tortured.. And the Joker points to the answer is to cause mayhem and destruction and murder in the world to a generation who have lost all meaning. And that's dangerous. "
1863," Joaquin deserves an Oscar! Better than Heath!
", Beyond amazing and beyond words! Joaquin's portrayal as Joker is deserving and must have a Oscar! Touching on mental illness and depression really hits home! I have suffered from depression and I felt he understood and portrayed it beyond expectations! Tons of shocks and just overwhelming performance! Joaquin is the Joker! 
1864," Thats masterpiece

1868," People just dont know how to rate a MOVIE
"," The way the film develops, transmitting what lives and passes the character in his life is excellent, the people who demands more detail just.. go and buy a comic book, we are talking about a movie, not a book, the film's production is excellent, the performance of Phoenix is impeccable, no doubt until today, the best joker in the history of cinema "

1872," One of the greatest origin stories ever
"," This film is about a man who begins to start a crippling downfall with his own sanity and mental state. Believe the hype and excitement over this movie, never before have I ever seen a movie use such gut-wrenching realism to it's advantage before. With little to no issues with the movie itself, this movie is up there with the top movies of this year or dare I even say top movies of the decade. Understanding the complexity of the psychological mind of a human as he/she goes through various levels of distress shows how impossibly intelligent this film is. Without a doubt, I give this movie a perfect 10/10, go and watch this film NOW!! "
1873," Amazing
", If your a Batman fan you'll love this movie. If your not a fan you will still love this movie. This movie was a very dark take on how the joker came too. Very well done. 
1874," Oscar number 2 for Joker.
"," Has there ever been a character portrayed that has led to 2 people winning an oscar for? This is potentially the first for that, Phoenix is remarkable. "
1875," Absouletly uncomfortable,intense and intriguing! A TRUE MASTERPIECE
"," So this is my first ever review on here and i had to do this!<br/><br/>This movie is unreal, no movie ever has made me feel.this way from the awkward eerie feeling to the intensity and epicness! This is a movie that touches on issues i think people should be aware of! Joaquin Phoenix's version of the joker is incomparable, you cannot compare him to heath ledger, they are just as great in there own right! I could say this is the best movie i have ever seen ourely for the fact on what you will feel watching this, Joaquin will deffinetly win an oscar mark my words. "
1876," Brilliance That'll Send Chills, and clowns
",
1877," THE HYPE IS REAL!!
"," What an outstanding movie!! Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job portraying his version of the Joker! Best performance since Heath Ledger! The legend continues! I love the pacing throughout the movie, Cinematography was amazing, the Dialogue was on point! I left the theaters with a huge smile on my face! After watching this movie, you will get a little understanding the Joker's origin. Must watch! "
1878," Just perfect
"," How can I put it another way?
I'm a psychiatrist and I can clearly see the mental state evolution that gave birth to this ultimate Gotham villain, Joker, flawlessly! "
1879," Masterpiece

1880," First Time Reviewing any Movie and believe me, its absolute MASTERPIECE and perfect tribute to Heath Ledger in heaven
",
1881," Darker than what you ever thought it would be
"," Holy origin story Batman! Went to the premier of this movie and walked out of the movie theatre in complete shock and awe. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in the role. Don't want to give away spoilers, but this movie draws you in as you watch the life of Arthur fleck crumble before your own eyes. This version of the joker pays homage to the predecessors in its own way. I really do think heath would have been floored by the performance. While some things in the movie were a bit ""cliche"" I think the writing did an amazing job of tying everything together and left us wanting more in the end. Lives up to the hype and then some! "
1882," Impressed to say the least
"," Having just finished watching, I am stunned to say the least.
Jaquines' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation
to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition.
As unfortunate event after unfortunate event baraded the Joker leading to circumstantial wrong-doings, I truly felt for the character, while also being aware that his actions were wrong.
Amidst the action packed superhero movies presented today (and as much as I do enjoy those as well) this movie is truly in a league of it's own.
Joker takes the lore and characters we have grown to love and revere as immeasurable beings, and throws it in your face as an all too real, true to life possibility. "
1883," As good as the hype surrounding it.
",
1884," I am awestruck!!!
"," Oh man, my jaw is on the floor back at the theater! As many great movies as there have been this year, this one takes the cake for me! Besides being a fantastic character study of The Joker, this is such an important social commentary that I think should bring up some much needed conversations. Joaquin Phoenix is a god and this is right up there with his best work in The Master, You Were Never Really Here, Her, Two Lovers, Inherent Vice and more. Todd Phillips deserves so much praise for bringing this beautifully twisted portrait to life. Everything from the cinematography to the score to screenplay was just perfect. I'm still gathering my thoughts and have soooo many. I think this is a film people are gonna be and should be talking about for a while. I am awestruck and gotta go see it again as soon as possible! "
1885," Outstanding!!!
"," 10/10 This film is truly outstanding. The cinematography is gorgeous with unique shots which I truly appreciated. The story was excellently told. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker is outstanding, thrilling, creepy and funny at times. A superb Joker origins. I cant say Joaquin Phoenix topped Heath Ledger as the Joker, as they play two completely different versions of the character. But Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Heath Ledger are number 1 in my books as playing the best version of the Joker. An excellent film indeed that will surely be taking home an Oscar or two. "
1886," Joker for the oscar
", If you want to watch the very good movie go and watch the joker right now this master piece Didn't have green screen a lot i think in this movie Didn't use green screen ok why this movie it's so good? Because Joaquin Phoenix this actor acting joker so good and this movie Didn't have second prime actor with Joaquin Phoenix he is the play every thing in any scene in this movie we see the joker even in flash back and the related between joker and bross wayen it's so good that's it go and watch the joker 
1887," Calling this movie perfect is a understatement!
"," I've watched a lot of movies in my life and I have felt that there is always something that could have been done better, but this time I wouldn't even dare to change anything it's a truly masterpiece! I have to say it Joaquin Phoenix was so good that he's now in my opinion the best actor and joker that has ever lived. Now comes the sad part! The movie was like eating the best meal you will ever have, when the plate is empty you realize it's only downhill from here! "
1888," The best ""comic book"" movie!!!
", Darker than dark knight!!! It beats endgame in the race for the best comic book of the year!!! 
1889," Hard to watch, hard to look away.
",
1890," Give the man his Oscar!
", From start to finish the movie was SPECTACULAR!! Especially the last 15 minutes... 100% would see again! 
1891," Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?
"," I went back from the movie yesterday. Phoenix definitely deserve an Oscar for this performance.<br/><br/>Don't believe the critics, this film was one of the best films I had watched in my life. The critics dislike the film due to political correctness and moral highground. Come on we all know what is happening in the world right now.<br/><br/>Yes, the film was definitely disturbing, dark and violence but point to the core problems of our societies. The emptiness of our cultures, the ever widening income gap and the hypocritical of human nature will still be there with or without this movie. At least the director has the guts to point out the problems and let us have the chance to rethink and rebuild our world before it is too late.<br/><br/>We don't listen, do we? "
1892," Best movie ever
"," Best filming best actor best action parts and best story nothing to say
heroes always dont know the truth...
Dont forget to smile :) "
1893," MASTERPIECE!
"," It's dark, bold, and harsh portrayal of the mentally ill person who got beaten down by the apathetic society to the point where he left feeling having no choice than to ""fight back"" in a brutal, deranged way as his mind is.
The movie makes you feel emphatic for the character, but not justify the things he did or labeled it as good things. it's showing us what ignorance, lack of decency, and a broken system can cause in the most extreme way possible.
The acting, cinematography, scores, it's all perfect. best movie of the year! "
1894," There's a new Joker in town.
", What a brilliant performance. His dance on the stairs was so great I wanted to get up from my seat and do the same. The shot where he was on the bonnet of police car was so dramatic. He is a superb actor. Nice direction too. Take a bow. 
1895," ABSOLUTELY ONE OF MUST-WATCH MOVIE BEFORE YOU DIE!
"," ""Is it just me or is it has no flaw at all?""
""I used to think that Joker was a tragedy-comedy movie, but now I realize, it's a PIECE OF REALITY.""
""The worst part of making a good movie is many people is expect it to behave as if it don't."" "
1896," First Half : ""I feel bad for this Guy"". Second Half : ""I am terrified of this Guy""
"," Just came from a first day first show, and let me give you a free advice completely straight forward. Never ever listen to the critics they are a bunch of sold ********.<br/><br/>
There wasn't a single thing that could be controversial. Just pure Oscar winning performance by a great actor. And if some incel gets triggered from this then its his evil brain that need to be shot.<br/><br/>
For me, Heath ledger was an unpredictable clown with no emotions.
Joaquin phoenix is a clown that blasted from pain into a monster.<br/><br/>Some people will tell that (just to look cool) heath ledger was the legend and Joaquin Phoenix was good but not heath ledger level even after watching this masterpiece, but deep down they know that Joaquin phoenix surpassed Heath and achieved a god level(which is obviously many levels ahead of ""legend"").<br/><br/>And that laugh, dear god that is just terrifying. you can tell by that laugh that the guy is in some serious emotional trauma.<br/><br/>
critics was being like that this movie is so violent and disturbing and blah and blah blah. you can count homicides in this movie on your fingers.
Joker kills three sexual harassers, one backstabbing A-hole, one TV host(you should judge him after watching movie), his mother(which is not clear that either she is his biological mother or one who adopted him) and an Arkham asylum therapist(which is not shown graphically).<br/><br/>
Movie is very brilliantly made. Everyone did a great job and hats off to Joaquin who took his performance to god level. sure in distant future someone can achieve god level performance but cannot surpass it.<br/><br/>
Never listen or read to any ""professional"" critic cause they are getting paid for it. So they can't be trusted. Go watch the movie and make your own honest opinion because ""you are paying for it, not getting paid for it"". "
1897," MASTERPIECE
",
1898," So basically Joker has a psychotic disorder
"," The acting in this movie was superb and the music was excellent. That being said, I was disappointed that they painted the joker as someone with a schizophrenic disorder. The stigma of mental illness is already a problem that plagues society, it's disappointing for Hollywood to continue to endorse the negative stigma. In reality, the majority of crimes are not committed by people who are mentally ill. Also, there is no way they would have stopped a persons medicine cold turkey just because they ran out of funds. They always refer them to someone who can fill their medication, especially when someone is severely mentally ill. In reality, the social worker who didn't refer him to someone would have been held legally liable for the murders. "
1899," I don't see how that highly intelligent Joker on Dark Night started from this insane person
"," The Joker on The Dark Night is a highly intelligent person who holds deep conversations with prominent people, capable of planning a complicated bank robbery and was one step ahead of Batman, the police and intelligence. He has a strong personality free from emotionality and he laughed controllably.
I can't see how this mentally unstable person on this Joker becomes that awesome Joker. "
1900," It's not Joker
"," Crazy story, but not from DC Gotham city
This Joker is not amazing, not smart or creative. This Joker not for people, he is for Hoakine Phoenix, to show, he is fantastic drama. Don't show this movie to children "
1901," Never thought after Heth Ledger..
", Absolute Masterpiece. The best performance I've ever been Privileged enough to see is Heth Ledger's performance as the joker in the Dark Knight. I never thought I would be leaving the movie with more awe then that untill Ioker. This movie is inspirational and entertaining as any movie I've ever watched 
1902," Masterpiece
"," This movie is perfect from any point of viewüòçif i can, i would give my vote for this at the Oscars. "
1903," Greatest movie of al time clearly
", This is a movie for everyone not just for comic book fans 
1904," Marginally crazy guy loses job and gets predictably more crazy... The End
"," Feels a bit like Requiem for a Dream meets Taxi Driver, but not nearly as good as either. Was there a single memorable script line or cerebral plot twist in the entire film? Not that I noticed. "
1905," Sad and borring, depressive storie about mad person
"," Sad and borring, depressive storie about mad person. Do not waste time and money, especial in friday evening, cause it will ruine your day and make it sad and uncomfortable, like autumn weather on streets. "
1906," Completely Masterpiece
"," Joker movie created big hype over DC fans. Even Marvel fans got their interest over here. After watching the movie, I realized you won't be disappointed. Clearly the movie is......(out of words). I'm not giving any spoilers. You better enjoy the movie on October. "
1907," Awful movie
", It is so cringe to see people saying this movie is a masterpiece. It was so horribly depressing and twisted I can't believe people find it entertaining. Terrible film. 
1908," Waste of money and time
"," This movie won't be felt only by those who suffer and feel such feelings as the character does...
It need some ill people mentally or physically who suffered during there life time to appreciate it.
And from the rating I believe that a lot of ppl have experienced such circumstances hence the sympathy towards it. "
1909," Actually I saw many movies
", But tollywood movie kalki was realy good thrilling and last end was suprising its wonderfully directed. 
1910," Toker
"," Here again Phoenix does his go-to awkward,loner-stoner schtick. But this time he surely must get the nod from the Academy for the sheer effort of heavy makeup, scrawnyer than usual body and the gargantuan artistic achievement of forcibly sucking in his stomack in all but every scene.
In fact, Phoenix's stomach is a concave testament to character-building at it purest, as the vacuum at the center of his body is the vacuousness of this entire airheaded one-noted whine of a movie.
Every plot(?)-point is so derivative and contrived as to inevitably turning into a game of spot the reference. Here is mostly steals from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy but also bits from Fight Club amongst others. But with none of their flair in writing and direction, and their note-perfect timely commentary dumbed down here to blunt confusion; a doddering senile ¬´these are the times we live in,now..¬ª.
The films protagonist is chased through the movie by the most inept pair of detectives outside a cartoon and the Toker himself is portrayed as so feeble-minded as to be utterly improbable as the eventual master criminal, The Joker.
So what is this mess, really?
Yet again, one more in the endless parade of hateful Hollywood-fantasies of violent,nihilistic murder and mayhem towards anyone who dares to disagree with the losing left.
The protagonist is a catalyst for societal rampage by masked hordes of clowns rioting, burning and pillaging in the streets. They are of course stand-ins for Antifa and Occupy Wall Street.
Wayne, the caricatured politician, calling his possible constituents loser-clowns, is of course a stand-in for Trump. So the writers get to shoot him, too.
Petty? You bet! Who was it again that during election made an ongoing talking point of the peaceful transition of power? "
1911," Overrated
"," I don't understand how people like this movie so much. It is extremely slow paced and boring. You have to wait almost an hour before anything interesting happens. Some of the camera shots are extremely annoying espaically the over repeated use of characters taking up the wrong space of each shot. Alot of the shots are just blank nothings that drag on, possibly to add suspense but it doesn't work if the film is boring to begin with.<br/><br/>The fact that this guy even turns into the joker is extremely unbelievable. He isn't smart or good at using his intuition like the actual joker would. To think this guy would be batman's greatest foe is embarrassing.<br/><br/>If it was a stand alone movie unrelated to the batman series then I would of appreciated it more.<br/><br/>The main characters acting was decent but he wasn't given a good enough script to display anything worthy of an Oscar. Half the movie he is just dancing. Give him a strictly come dancing award, not an Oscar.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype, the movie is mediocre at best and predictable. It wasn't worth making childcare arrangements for. Wish I just watched it at home so I could have just turned it off when I got bored. "
1912," Just bad as in not good.
"," Just bad as in not good.<br/><br/>I would like to be able to say more but the movie has no substance in any form.<br/><br/>The move is so lacking of any plot that to construct a review, I would need to watch a movie with substans and plot. Joker as a movie has none of this!<br/><br/>I can say that having to fill the space for this review is a Joke but, at least it requires a lot more concentration than watching the Joker.<br/><br/>This movie is very derivative boring and just the same scene repeated over and over it is very predictable. "
1913," Bether joker on the world
"," When things are exactly as Great as you expected them to be...<br/><br/>Truly a masterpiece, best film of 2019, one of the best films of the century, second best DC film after The Dark Knight. 10 out of 10 to Direction and Acting. Joaquin Phoenix goes inside the character's head and maybe forgets his true self. The best thing about the film is we feel empathy for a psychopath who DOES NOT feel empathy for anyone, that is so deep character, that no one can hate. A legend. Also the cinematography, background score, songs and runtime are all impressive.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised to see 10 Oscar Nominations and Most Wins this year.

1914," Overhyped and not everyone joker performance is worthy of an oscar.
", Holy cow did I almost fall asleep while watching this movie. Joaquin Phoenix was fine but it just felt like Joaquin pheonix in clown makeup with long hair. Sorry but every performance as the joker doesn't mean oscar worthy winning. People gotta lay off the over hype. Movie was boring the last 20 minutes where okay but it dragged on and on. 
1915," King Of Network Taxi Driver aka The Gen Z version of The Joker
"," This movie is a basic carbon copy of plots lifted from the movies Taxi Driver ,The King of Comedy and Network.
Act 1 features the introduction of Arthur who is playing a mentally deranged clown that is just walking the footsteps of Travis Bickle through Gotham City. You begin feeling sorry for Arthur as you quickly learn he is a poor lonely soul harboring mental problems. He has a sick mother who is the added key plot point to tie his Joker character to the Batman aka Bruce Wayne.
Act 2 Arthur slowly descends into madness while developing an interest in being a comedian combined with an obsession over a late night talk show host. Essentially The King of Comedy with a tongue in cheek twist. The talk show host is played by Robert DeNiro *wink,wink*
Act 3 is just a slow dragging transition from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver motifs towards the final manic crescendo which echos an in your face near carbon copy lift of the Howard Beale rant and meltdown execution on live TV from the film Network. They even lifted the iconic scene from Network in which the camera pans out to several monitors inside a TV studio control room featuring random commercials, various news broadcasts and of course the man of the hour Arthur who has now emerged as the Joker
The end result ties it all together as an introduction to yet another comic book character villain. Most audiences under the age of 34 will completely vibe with this amalgamation of classic films. The current 18-34 age group tend to possess a blissful ignorance towards ""old"" movies and the general consensus among the youth of today is a total disdain for the nostalgia of anything before the year 2000. For someone who grew up in the 70's 80's and 90's this movie is nothing but a slap in the face and a gut punch to lovers of great cinema who are being inundated with banal, unoriginal film making combined with a flagrant unabashed piracy of storytelling "
1916," Just creepy and weird
"," This is one of the most overrated movies ever. Once again, Joaquin Phoenix's creepy weirdness totally overshadows everything else in this film. He's so desperate to make this his own character, that he makes the whole film awkwardly uncomfortable and unenjoyable to watch. I'm not sure what character he was supposed to be, but it sure wasn't the joker. He was just a creepy guy in a clown costume with extensive psychological issues. Skip this garbage. "
1917," Forces structure on meaningless behavior
", Movie glorified evil and irrationality in the beginning. It acquired some meaning towards the end. If it wasn't for the cinematography it would have never managed to engage such a vast audience. 
1918," Masterpiece
"," Saw it at TIFF and I can confirm that this is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix is Oscar worthy, the score is beautiful and the cinematography is riveting.<br/><br/>This is a must watch. "
1919," The most overrated bore fest you will see this year
"," I get the madness, the depression, the knocks, the highs and the tragedy. Every part of these traits is covered extremely well by the very impressive Joaquin's ""Joker"".<br/><br/>But the film itself is just so boring. I was just wishing it would get out of second gear. Pleading that it might pull out into the fast lane to overtake the heavy juggernaut of another mundane movie. For this baby was the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa of comic book movies. Surely it should leave all before it for dust.<br/><br/>Sadly it never did.<br/><br/>If you want to see a man's desperate fall into madness, sadness and then ultimately loosing it. Go see Falling Down. It's a damn sight better than this. "
1920," Average movie
"," I don't get it. What's all the hype about?
I watched it last night and to me it was just another average movie, nothing more. I even felt like at times it was too slow and it was getting kind of boring. "
1921," Boring AF
"," Bored from 10 min in. Uneven and jumpy story with little point. Waste of time. The acting was absolutely on point, however, the directing and cinematography was beyond lacking. "
1922," Joker - I was made one..!!
", I should say other than the protagonist's acting skills nothing is even worth watching in the movie for me .It's such a negative movie and I am so shocked to see a 9.4 rating in IMDb. I just hope makers spread better messages than such negativity.. 
1923," What idiotic FIlm
", I can say that Phoenix is master actor. Bt this does still not make a great movie. And thsi movie lives from blabla in every medium.This has nothing to do with the joker and the only thing behind is to make money with bad and good media. Todd Philips should maybe read some comics and don;t copy movies like taxi driver or similar. 
1924," JOKER - IT'S ON YOU.

1925," Amazing. Crazy and awesome
", Best of the year. Just like what joker is all about 
1926," Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar worthy performance!!!!
"," Not only Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career at the same time he carries The Legacy of Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. And also Todd Philips gives us a film is both dark,twisted,hilarious and one of the best film of this year (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê). "
1927," Hounestly the movie of the year
"," Joaquin pheonix's performance is out of this world, the joker is a perfect story of a man driven to madness by society, defenantly the best movie of 2019 "
1928," Disappointing. Sorry, I have to disagree with the masses on this one.
"," It's pretty clear this film makes a lot of people believe they understand mental health more than they did before watching it. If they DO understand it better, hooray, but I suspect that for many it enhances real understanding little more than Rain Man did for Autism. Rather anecdotally and surface.
So, in my view, another opportunity missed.
But what really disappointed me was Phoenix. He was amazing in Gladiator, and probably did a better illumination of mental health in that.
I was looking at my watch from 40' into Joker, and pretty much every 20' from there. Just didn't do it for me, sorry. "
1929," best movie ive seen in years!!! seriously im a amateur critic n loved this movie along with outstanding performance
", Ive only seen a few batman movies so i decided to go watch joker and since joaquin was the leading actor i thought it would be decent. i was impressed with the movie completely from the narrative to the soundtrack to the ending. and acting from joaquin was phenomenal deserves a OSCAR hands down!!! best performance ive seen in years since decaprio and the revenant. its so good im going next weeknd and watch it again...i havent done that since well ive never done that before. 10/10 movie i couldnt find a flaw in his acting role 
1930," Good acting, poorly written
", The movie seems to drag on towards the end. And when they do end the movie it was very unsatisfying. I felt like there were multiple times to end the movie before they did that were much better. The acting was good overall. 
1931," Tries too hard to be edgy, takes itself too serious
",
1932," we live in a society
", Truly says a lot about our society as a whole 10/10 best film 
1933," A Masterpiece.
"," Really a masterpiece, not only because it's from dc universe and we're so familiar with the character of joker, but also because we can relate to it. It is a dark film. Joaquin phoenix really did an amazing job and did the character justice, i would even go on to say that he will possibly win the oscars for the phenomenal job he has done in this movie, really worth a watch. "
1934," This wasn't a Joker movie
"," This film was exceptionally boring and lacked the intensity of the comic book character. The Joker's story was forgotten and replaced with an excellent portrayal of mental illness. Joker, the beloved villian of insanity, is really only about the last 5 to 10 minutes of the film. "
1935," The end was very bad
"," It's disappointing to watch
I see its not dessert to watch "
1936," JOKER is uneven, unfocused, and trying so say so many different things that it ends up saying nothing at all...and that's the point.
",
1937," Over Hyped
"," Huge disappointment. Another way over hyped release from Hollywood. Actors acting crazy isn't hard for them. While a lot of people give Joaquin Phoenix huge rave reviews, looking at the performance with a deeper critical view reveals just a deeper level of crazy. You'd have to pay me to watch this one again. Story line was also very weak and the movie puts all of its eggs into the one basket of Joaquin Phoenix. Hollywood continues to try to outdo the previous versions of a character that by now is long worn out. "
1938," Excellent performance! Oscar worthy!!
"," The performance of Phoenix's was astonishing, he nails both characters of the Joker and as Arthur.<br/><br/>The amount of time and focus both during the movie production and prior can clearly be seen in Phoenix's performance. This is definitely one of Phoenix's best performances and is highly worth of an Oscar nomination!<br/><br/>Todd's directing highly deserves his share of the praise for this movie! The make-up and costume design was too excellent. "
1939," Terrible utter garbage
", I went to see this movie in Hope's there would be a good back story to the joker but this movie was so slow and boring I almost slept through it. I don't know how it's getting such high ratings. I wouldn't see it again if you paid me to. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I never write reviews but I'm literally still sitting in the theater because this couldn't wait. I had to save someone else from witnessing this garbage. 
1940," So dissapointing and boring!!!
", Joaquin Phoenix did a wonderful job with this role if this role was the orgin story for buffalo bill from silence of the lambs. The most depressing sad and limp-wristed version of the joker that I've ever seen. The origin story was not really that bad the portrayal of the joker whith his very feminine dancing and absolutely no masculinity was not any version of the joker that I remember. 
1941," Most depressing movie of the year, overacting and not canon
"," I went to a mostly empty premiere with about a dozen others. There were two fan boys with me who have comic book rooms in their houses. We were unenthusiastic. The film was boring, depressing, sad. There were two funny moments that were unintentional. I see that in Italy at the premiere it got an 8 minute standing ovation, that should be a warning. When artsy people like something, it is going to be a crappy art project. That is what this is. Depressing. Sad. I don't know how else to put it. When it was over, people were saying WTH? I see a lot of 10 reviews on here -- nubes. Anyone who is a comic book fan would see this as a bust, they should have spent the movie on a Batman reboot. Can't recommend. Won't ever see again. Can't imagine anyone buying the DVD. "
1942," A Disappointment.
", Slow with an incomprehensible plot .The only saving grace is Joaquin Phoenix. Sometimes the character is highly exaggerated and his mannerisms become annoying after a while. 
1943," A Good Lead Performance--Yet a Poor Character Study
",
1944," Go see ""IT""
"," ... Chapter Two, the OTHER killer clown in theaters.<br/><br/>This Joker movie is ripe with cynicism, it probably is the only way to get the audience to sympathize with a sociopathic killer. Yuck "
1945," Nothing special
"," Trailer is better than the actual movie. Really weak directing/script, I was bored in 10 min after I start watching it. I think that Hollywood should make films in a form of a trailer, 2 30 min is way too much for one repeated multiple times message.
Hoped to see something unique and special.
Cant recommend. "
1946," Awful
", Heath Ledger... hands down! Too much hype. Phoenix will most probably get the Oscar but not for me thanks. 
1947," Overhyped
", This is a bleak and very overyhyped movie. The acting was excellent though. 
1948," BEST MOVIE EVER
", Joker has always been the centre of attraction and jaquine has definatley put his best 
1949," Dont believe the hype
"," Great performance and music, but the scenario is way bellow expectations. There is no character development, just isn't complex enough and dialogues are kind of superficial, especially for a Joker.
Should have waited for it on Netflix. "
1950," One of the worst movies in my life
"," I dislike this movie, although I do not deny the great performance of Joaquin Phoenix. I extremely dislike the ways to send the genuine message about mental illness: unrealistically ugly graffiti everywhere on/in the bus and buildings, unreasonable intensified music here and there, over-centered crime scenes, unrealistic incapable/stupid police, weird development of psychiatric disorders, unbelievable reaction of the society to the crime behaviors... all of them make me extremely uncomfortable rather than enjoying the show. "
1951," Why so serious?
"," Bleak, rarely entertaining, unoriginal, didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it all a dream in the end? When the lights came on in the cinema you could sense the disappointment in the audience. Stony silence. Wish I trusted my gut and didn't go. Just re-watch Heath Ledger's Joker again, honestly. At least it tries to balance art with entertainment, and doesn't just sink into the depths of pretentiousness. Phoenix does his best, but between this and: You were never really here, he needs to lighten it up a bit. Commodus in Gladiator was more interesting and well rounded. "
1952," Extremely brutal and no deeper then a depression
"," The Film doesn't deserve it's age recommendation, it's heavily brutal and bloody.<br/><br/>The story itself is very flat, not much deeper then about a person who has to laugh when feeling bad/sad.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it's really well played. The actors are damn good, sound editing, cut, ... really good artists there :) "
1953," Awful
"," Absolutely awful script, oscar nominations you got to be joking unless they give Oscars for the most boring film made. It was on par for the worst portrayal of the joker with Jared Leto. "
1954," legendary
"," Movie of the year. pure masterpiece<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix
Is fantastic
Best joker after Mark Hamill<br/><br/>psychological build-up of an already insane man.<br/><br/>fascinating transformation<br/><br/>actually gets very sympathetic compassion for the villain "
1955," MASTERPIECE
"," It's one of those movies that you want to see again and again and again, it's just brilliant!!! "
1956," Did not expect this to be so good
"," I was very skeptical going into this, especially after being scarred for life with Jared Leto's Joker (ugh)..in my eyes no body could beat Heath Ledger's Joker...I must say though - Joaquin did an excellent job! This Joker to me was very deep, it showed more of the mentally ill side of the Joker rather than a crazy criminal mastermind, which he did a great job at capturing that vibe. It's deff worth a watch !! "
1957," Lived up to the hype and expectations. Get Joqauin Phoenix his Oscar right now
", Don't believe people who say this movie is bad this is a masterpiece and deserves several oscars 
1958," Phoenix, literally to the word!
"," Joaquin Phoenix just like the phoenix has risen back from the ashes. His performance was way beyond one could have expected from him. Performance of his life!!
An epic movie with the perfect casting, performances, background score, storyline and cinematography. This movie is gonna standout in the history in times to come. Even when I watched it the second time, I was still held on the way when I watched it the first time.
Please do watch it for Phoenix's performance, watch it to see how a perfect movie looks like. "
1959," Long time no see
"," Movies been dead to me long time until this came up. I bet this movie will keep ringing a bell in years to come as it strikes the core conflict of western world cultural issue which rooted from the structure of the society which is to worship so-called property gaining success instead of moral value champions. Individuals are so detached intentionally by design to perpetuate the poor keep being poor and rich keep being rich. Self-endeavor will not matter. To success, you fight. Why? The system has been designed this way. Until at times, the people fed up, the people say enough is enough. And here is the ""Joker"". "
1960," A film like no other in this day and age
"," Joker is a difficult film to review, as it will be a difficult film to enjoy for some people because it's not a single layered story, and it does not try to help you understand it. It requires your involvement to pay attention, question things, look for clues regarding what's really happening in the story. Before the final act, it does answer one important question so that everyone is more or less on the same page, but it blurs the lines once again in its ending as to what really happened in that final act. It's a tough movie. It depicts mental illness, its perception, its management, its treatment, its place in society, in a cold, hard, brutally realistic manner. It's not glamorized, or ""sweetened"" to make it more likable or relatable. It's not a super hero, or super villain story. It's a downward spiral into the mind of a very sick individual who tries to stay above water but eventually gives in to his inner demons because no other option is there for him, it's a movie about where we stand as a society when it comes to treating each other, it's a movie about kindness, the absence thereof, and its effects on people who need it. Some will love the movie, some will hate it, a lot just won't get it. Nothing to do with being smart, it's just a matter of experience with mental illness, which is played so brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. "
1961," Only kids and people
", That lives in ignorance or not old enough to realize how some people suffer won't give this movie the best score. Its art and the acting is tremendously well played. Absolutely brilliant. 
1962," M A S T E R F U L
"," Phoenix was impressive in his impression of the Joker . He showed the Joker is in all of us and if we treat each other as badly as he was, Then We all can fall into the Dark . Heath Ledger would be very happy with this Performance and I hope they do the Middle Chapter of this Story , We all wanna really know how he got those Scars "
1963," How Joker becomes Joker
"," Joker. We all know who that character is even for the one who is a complete stranger to the Batman Universe. A psychopathic clown who takes everything as a comedy spreading evil and death as a wave of joke.<br/><br/>This movie tells us the story of how a man who thought he was made to make people around him happy becomes the mean, evil murderer we all know. The story of a man whose life has been nothing but pain, loneliness and bullying. A man who got so sickened by what's going on around him, the evilness and cruelty of this world who takes him as a fool, he snaps and decides to take his revenge on it. This is the story of how Joker becomes Joker.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role of a broken man who was already dead inside and chose to not care anymore. He is often very touching in his performance when he takes care of his sick mom or when he tries to figure out what makes him so different from the people around him. He made me feel a lot of sympathy for the character who I always considered as a heartless psychopath. I wept for him each time he was beaten up by cruel people and for the first time, he made me despise Thomas Wayne who until this movie has been pictured as a man caring for the people of Gotham.<br/><br/>In this movie, he is the evil man, the selfish bully who considers the people on the fringe of society as a bunch of peasants and losers who are a burden to the city. That can be shocking but it's also refreshing.<br/><br/>In fact this story shines a different light on why Joker becomes such an evil and merciless murderer. For him, he's not the one who is evil, it's the world around him and to take down that monster, he has to become a monster himself. He has to be that ruthless mean murderer to survive. Only for this, this movie should be praised and watched.<br/><br/>I didn't realize this when I first reviewed this movie but a week after watching it and think it through with a cool head, I understand now. There are some scenes I don't understand yet especially the very last scene which still makes me feel like all of this was just a script running in his head. Maybe one day I will understand what it really means.<br/><br/>Anyway that's a great movie and it deserves its high rating. I wouldn't be surprised if it reaps a lot of awards at the end of the year especially Joaquin Phoenix who is mesmerizing in this movie. "
1964," ""A perfect example of a cruel world it is out there""
"," Oh my, after walking out of the theater, this is hands down, The most memorable film I've ever seen in my life, I loved it, I thought it was excellent. I recommend any Marvel fans or DC fans to see it if you haven't "

1967," Different but good
"," Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this. Oscar probably guaranteed already.<br/><br/>However, for me, the overall film itself was just good. Not sure I found it as amazing as others have seen to. I know it was meant to be different and quite dark, but it's maybe a bit too far that way for me.<br/><br/>Definitely still worth the watch though. "
1968," Joaquin's no joke as the Joker...
",
1969," Epic origin story
"," Wow..fantabulous!!! This is by far the best Joker origin story that we've seen or read before. Joaquin is at his marvelous best. This movie actually makes you feel for the Joker and gives a rationale to all bad things 'The Joker' would do or become in the future. Hats off to Todd Phillips, I guess you can do nothing wrong with the director's hat on your head. "
1970," Ignore the hit job by reviewers
",
1971," Who said this Joker is completely different from the comics?
"," This is the first Joker, in movies, who has it all. The unpredictable behaviour, theatrical moves, the insane laugh and kills just like that. They even made an origin movie and this guy is still a mystery, without a real name. And thank GOD, he did not become an anti-hero, a martyr or an idea. This is the JOKER, the one and only. "
1972," Beautiful
"," It's a beautiful feeling you get when an art form goes deep inside you &amp; tickles your heart.<br/><br/>That's how I feel about this movie. It succeeds in giving you us audience a close up view of the world we live in &amp; how it consistently wrongs us on many levels &amp; ultimately has to pay a price for that.
This reminds me of a line from Crime &amp; punishment, where it says, ""Crime is a protest to abnormality of the unorganized society"".
Joker shows us the mirror &amp; it is natural to feel uncomfortable which is exactly what serves the purpose of a movie being made is to.<br/><br/>Every 21st century fello "

1974," Proof that comedic directors can make real films
"," This film is magnificent. It is disturbing, suspenseful and original- from the same director as the ""Hangover"" movies. Todd Phillips proves his cinematic skill with this dark and provoking thriller/character study. From the retro Warner Bros. logo at the beginning to the vintage ""The End"" title card at the chilling conclusion, ""Joker"" will no doubt affect the viewer in one way or another. Of course, it would be absurd to not attribute part of this film's excellence to Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance. One half terrifying, one half sympathy-evoking, and 100% believable, Phoenix delivers more than the audience could have ever asked for. The entire film is cemented by the eerie soundtrack, composed by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. This Joker is unlike any of its predecessors, and will likely remain unrivalled for years to come. "
1975," Worldwide opinion
", If you don't give this movie a 10/10 then you're crazy and you don't have any taste in movie and i would prefer you watch Bollywood and some Korean movies and get out of my hollywood legends movies 
1976," The single greatest acting performance I've ever seen.. And I've seen alot.
"," Anyone telling you that this movie is anything short of amazing, is more than likely a moron.<br/><br/>I rate it in the top 5 movies of all times..
Even the huge hype dosen't prepare you for this unforgettable, amaing experience. I was literally in awe and shock most of the way through. You just can't be ready for what is about to be revealed to you. I was SO happy as soon as the movie started. I knew it was going to be something new and boy I have never been more satisfied with a movie in my entire life. A Phenomenally, momentual landmark.<br/><br/>If you are truely a movie lover, do not midd out on this. "
1977," Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
",
1978," Look past the violence and understand that it is not what this film is about.
"," I just went to my local movie theater and saw Joker and can honestly say that it is one of the best movies that I've seen this year, and one of the best dramas and performances I've seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix truly shines and gives an oscar-worthy performance. As I was walking out I happen to see two police officers as well as a sign that said that if you wore Joker mask or put on face paint that you would be escorted out. I do not understand why people think that this movie is going to cause people to commit violent Acts or that they would even wear face paint or masks after the first showing of the first show Thursday at midnight. This movie is about Mental Health, not violence and people need to stop trying to strike fear into people because they are doing exactly what causes Arthur Fleck to become unhinged in this film. They're no better than the people who mistreat this man in the film.<br/><br/>This movie is about mental health in the sense that the main character is mentally unstable. He regularly goes to counseling sessions and keeps up with medication. The thing that drives him towards violence is the world around him. As you heard from the trailer and you'll hear in the movie, Arthur Fleck says that his mother told him that he was made to bring joy and happiness to people in the world, and he genuinely tries to do that through the art of clown, but with the way people are nobody can see that or understand that that is how he is trying to convey joy and love to the world, but the world does not want to convey joy and love and kindness back. Instead they beat down a man who is already been beaten down, and caused him to finally snap and believe that violence was the only answer, since it seemed to be the only thing that brought joy to people around him. He found a way to bring joy and happiness of the world just as his mother had told him he was put on this Earth to do.<br/><br/>Arthur says that he used to think his life is a tragedy but realized it was a comedy. This movie is incredibly tragic. When we cut funding for people who desperately need it to get counseling, and to feel better and understand themselves and their illness there are bound to be some problems. We all say that we want everybody to keep up a happy veneer and pretend to be happy for the sake of everybody else that nobody is sad, and this movie shows what that idea can do to people. It is not possible to be happy every single day of your life and most the time it's impossible to keep up the veneer that everything is great and you are happy to the people around you. If they cared they would know and understand when you are feeling down or unstable and come to you to help you or at least try to get you some help. Nobody comes to Arthur to help him in his time of need and he finds a solution by himself, which is not to say a acceptable or good solution, but a solution none the less. A solution that brings him joy and happiness that he should have never had to have picked in the first place. Thomas Wayne is the true villain in this movie, not Arthur Fleck. Arthur Fleck had no control of what people were going to do, or honestly what he was even going to do because, and I'm going to emphasize this again, he is mentally unstable and not able to make sound and sane decisions by himself in without help.<br/><br/>This movie is a rally cry to show people that there are people who are unstable and in pain all around them, we are just too blind to see them and do not want or care to do anything about it. "

"," Sadly a lot of snowflakes wont understand this movie, its a masterpiece &lt;3 &lt;3 "
1980," Driving a Ferrari in a Backyard!
"," Joaquin Phoenix Is phenomenal in this film, but the movie cannot use his performance to create a memorable film, lack of a good script and directing is so clear! Having Pheonix in this film is like driving a Ferrari in your back yard, a total waste of art ! Phillips was not a good choice to write and direct this film! (Coming from Hang Over and Due Date!!) "
1981," One of the Masterpieces of this century!
"," This movie is going to be one of the greatest masterpieces of this century! And years from now actors and filmmakers will look back at it as a form of inspiration. Joaquin's performance was so raw and powerful it was almost impossible to know if he was an actor or really the character!

Definitely, multiple Oscar worthy starting with Joaquin Phoenix "
1982," SPECTACULAR, MONUMENTAL, ....
"," Never felt awkwarder in the cinema before. Like, I felt this character deep in my bones. I felt his despair and sadness. I felt like committing those murders... murders I actually couldn't blame him for.

Thank you for this movie.
Definitely 10/10. "
1983," Amazing.

1985," Dark, Gritty and Interesting
", Never imgained a director who has directed hangover series can create this genre. Nor I have ever seen and given standing ovation in cinema before. You can even critize one scene in this movie.Too Good 
1986," Possibly the worst film I've ever paid to watch
"," This film has no plot. Like, at all. It just bumbles through its runtime to the point where you feel relieved when it's finally over and you can go home. It tried to present itself as a clever critique on modern society and the rise of extreme politics, but can't even do that properly. One scene everyone is pissed at the rich for treating them badly, but the next scene, these same people are being presented as bad people because they protest how they're treated. It also has scenes where the lead character imagines enjoying himself with another character that are all implied to have actually happened, and when you find they haven't (after he breaks into the apartment of the character in question), literally nothing happens to him. Everything is backwards and contradictory right from the word go. The only good thing is that Joaquin Phoenix works hard to portray the character as best he can, but that's entirely down to his skill as an actor and is nothing to do with the script (if there even was one) "
1987," As The Times said it ''Joker wants to be a movie about the emptiness of our culture. Instead, It's a prime example of It''

1988," Boring without story
"," I didnt find it exciting at all.
Bad and shallow story "
1989," I learned one thing.
"," It borrows a lot of elements to strive for an award nod. Well, except for good writing and acting. They even shamelessly use PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THEATRE as hype for this movie. As if it was because it is too edgy or scary. Brain damaged sissy dances while being annoying and rude to everyone. Then expects society to put him on a pedestal. The end. "
1990," Please dont waste your money !

1991," Average
"," I feel the odd one out here but the pacing seemed very off, the acting was great. By the time the film got to an interesting point I was already wishing for it to end. Could have cut a good portion of this film out to make it much better and much better in pacing. Far from a cinematic masterpiece which it should have been. "
1992," Great acting, clich√© story
", The story is just to easy and it isn't thrilling and i also think it isn't that dark. Especially if you have seen movies like requiem for a dream. Because of the acting the movie stays ok.<br/><br/>I agree with a review before this that the joker like this could never be a evil mastermind

",
2000," This movie is beautiful, Joaquin Phoenix Would Make Heath Ledger Proud
",
2001," Outstanding performance, beautiful but flawed film...
"," So everything you have heard about Phoenix's performance is deserved. It is by far one of the greatest efforts to tell a man's slide into despair and unhinged madness ever put to film. The comparisons to Taxi Driver especially and King of Comedy serve the movie well. In the same way that De Niro's Travis Bickell was socially inadequate and awkward and could not relate to people is here with Fleck too. Fleck is a physically twisted desicated husk of wretched failure, and crucially like Bickel his journey is hard to watch and you genuinely feel bad, almost guilty watching him as entertainment. However this is where the story begins to fail. The film completely lacks any degree of subtlety in telling the Jokers story. It may not be fair drawing such a blatant comparison to Taxi Driver but then the film is so unapologetically influenced by it, it revels in going into great detail about his origins and his tragic childhood. This is where the Ledger's Joker succeeds so well. He lied so much, he was a planner when he said he wasn't, he told conflicting stories about his scars and most effectively of all, he was utterly unpredictable and dangerous. I remember having a feeling of dread as to what mad lethal craziness he was going to do next and you did believe him when he said he was an 'agent of chaos'. At no point in Joker did I sense this, you have a pretty good idea of what he will do even when the film tries to indicate he may choose another path. Crucially Phoenix's joker lacks mystery. Everything is so explained there is not the possibility for the audience to use their own imagination as to his horrendous past.
Phoenix absolutely deserves all the praise he is getting, he breathes Fleck with such visceral rawness he makes him both equally captivating and painful to watch. The film itself is beautifully designed, the soundtrack matches the mood and tone and the cinematography is especially impressive. It's such a shame the story let the story down so to speak but the film did do what a great film should and leave an impression. My friends and I were left talking about the film long after it finished which is what a great film should do. Worth seeing for sure. "

2006," Why are we waisting a great actor on a half baked film
"," Wow. I can't believe what I watched. Not in a good way. Although the filmmakers said this was ""king of comedy"" or ""taxi driver"" it most certainly is not. Sorry to be saying this. I wanted to love it so much, and it was only reaching an entertaining moment in the last 15 min when it actually starts turning into a comic book movie. Although Joaquin created a very deep and dark Joker, he has nobody to bounce off of. The character in a Batman or actual Arkham Asylum scenario would be very interesting I didn't find this version very interesting. Also unfortunately I don't see anything in this Joker movie that makes me think Todd Phillips could reach anything close to Taxi Driver. There were a lot of topics touched on (race, poverty, mental health, comedy) that never really felt like they hit a real point of view. "
2007," a macabre movie attempting to be grandiose.
", Don't understand what's so entertaining about this. This is one sick depressing dark film. this is like using art to trigger murders. Absolute sick movie! Agenda is clear..!

"," I cannot understand why there are so many 10 out of 10's for this movie. I have rated it a 1 to compensate for the overly high ratings of many people on here, I would probably give it a 6 normally. Highly overrated. Very slow, and very dull, and depressing. The last half an hour was ok, but I didn't find the story very believable in the least. I found it to be painful to watch in many places. I will not be watching this movie again. "
2010," Highly Overrated

2013," Boring and disappointing üò£
"," Great job acting from Joaquin Phoenix if his job was to do the origin story for Buffalo Bill from The silence of the lambs. This is the most limp-wristed feminine non masculine joker I've ever seen. If this was not called The joker movie it would not have been that bad but just a horrible ""joker"" movie sorry but I think people are liking this just to not feel bad about the money they spent to watch it "
2014," This is extremely bad...
"," This whole film makes no sense, it's, apperently, completely overhyped.
I went to the theatre without any expectations, prejudice, etc. but man, what a bunch of...
This is my first review on IMDB, I had to join, seeing this film was rated a 9.0 "

Just watch this movie and you will get your answer.

2018," Just more bs from hollywood
"," This movie is just another cliched boring time-lost-costing-to-see, in the long lasting Hollywood non-new-ideas run, that had been the trend for too long now. Besides a good acting, Joaquin is a good one, the dance scene with Gary Glitter's song is just insufferable...it's like, ""really?!!! with Gary Glitter?!!"". The petty twists....one after another nonesense....too see it is just a time lost endeavor.
What ever happened to the good cinema, like Tarkovsky's? Or Carpenter's? "
2019," DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!!
"," This movie is hot garbage, the only thing good about the movie was Joaquin acting. There's no reason for this movie to have been all over the news and for theaters to have police on site in certain cities, only 6 people died by the joker in the movie and were by accident. If the original Purge would have featured the Joker then it would have made perfect sense for all the hype around this film. I mean how can the joker clearly imagine being on the Murry show and that be real but not to have really fallen in love with single mom for example, that would have made the movie wayyy more interesting. "
2020," time waste
"," I like all kind of movies, but this one was a continuous paranoia of a messed up guy, well played by the actor, without giving me a sense of entertainment of some sort, so all those great reviews mislead you in going to this film. "
2021," Niitzche's Zarathustra & Joker

""No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.

Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?""<br/><br/>Friedrich Nietzsche<br/><br/>-2-
All of Joker's ascending scenes showed Arthur with tire and weakness. In the other hand all of descending scenes were cheerful and accompanied with dancing and joy. And that is the philosophical soul due to Nietzche, ""I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his divine service. Revising the dancing scenes and relating it with Nietzche's free spirit, philosopher, Ubermensch and even the pious, it all sums up to let me see Joker as photocpy of Nietzche's Zarathustra. Nietzche's doesn't only believe that his superman should be a dancer but he also takes it to a divine level ""I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance"". Regardless of assuming that god is dead he still give him a dancing feature. Dancing is not only some rythmic and harmonic movements but it is an intellectual process dealing with ideas, man should dance swiftly over the ideas. The process that leads him to be that cheerful personality who descend from the mountain/stairs saying ""I love mankind"" and ""What spake I of love! I am bringing gifts unto men"".<br/><br/>-3-
Dancing is not only all of what is mentioned above, it's fulfilling bodie's desires and needs. Dancing is breaking the rules of body shame inheritance from several religions and code of Ideas. It's flipping all ethical systems, changing our counciousness from outward to US.<br/><br/>-4-

Joker is not a comedy. A couple of scenes brought laughter to the audience...
This I found quite disturbing at the very fact that the audience laughed at what makes the joker become the joker in the end. The laughter reflected the message that society can sometimes find a person a joke and laugh at them without really understanding the consequence of what that may have contributed to a person that they become.
The joker is dark. It's a powerful Film and a sad film too if you can appreciate the true genre of it. "

"," Joaquin Phoenix performance here is the best performance of the decade. He most certainly tly deserves an oscar for this. And then when you read some of the improv scenes such as the refrigerator scene or the dancing in the bathroom scene you realize even more how truly great he is in this film. 10 out of 10, my only issue with this film, and why I give it 10 instead of friggin 11 or 12 out of 10 lol, is it should have been a little longer and it should have had him as joker in full makeup doing bigger crimes. In short, they should have gone even bigger in scope with it. Heres hoping he makes a return ;) "
2033," NOT A MASTERPEICE BUT A GREAT MOVIE
"," I went to see this movie the first day it was released and i have to say i was a little bit disappointed because all the rave reviews i had seen or heard for this movie turned out to be nothing but exaggeration except for joaquin's acting, it met my expectations and is definitely worthy of an Oscar, this movie here is one of my top 3 movies this year including endgame and once upon a time in Hollywood. But the problem with this movie is that it doesn't have decent script, it relies too much on phoenix's acting skills, he delivers but no other aspect of this movie takes my breath away. it's cinematography is also wonderful but i don't rate movies based on cinematography. "
2034," Engaging but.......Joker lacked one quality
"," I normally don't watch these twisted, psychological, dark and dreary type of movies. But, my friends wanted a boys' night out and I wanted to go.<br/><br/>I was hooked from the beginning. The subtlety, the introspection, the clues revealing a tormented inner conscious. I never really did take my eyes off of the big screen, except for the three brutal killings that were too much for me to endure. I shielded my eyes with my buttered up popcorn hands.<br/><br/>Other than those scenes, I was glued from start to finish.<br/><br/>However, I had one hangup, with Joker as a leader. If he was going for Machiavelli, he failed. Napoleon he was not. He lacked the leadership quality that I would expect of an effective villain. I wanted to get behind his plundering and nefarious motivation, but he didn't hook me. Maybe a reading of Covey or Kabat-Zinn or even Thoreau would inspire the Joker to be less of an opportunist and more of a deliberate, Genghis Khan like figure.<br/><br/>He didn't earn the role of villain. He fell into it. "
2035," JOKER teaches us so much about WE SHOULD BE CONSCIOUS.
"," I have watched many movies which had aftereffects on me, but this is something else. Coming to the movie and its technicalities, No word can aptly portray how Phoenix potrayed the character of Joker. From being a guy who performs the act for earning his livelyhood, to becoming the Caharater, director Todd Philip has scripted the transformation wonderfully well.
Cinematography is unusual, I was thinking that something looks different, may be camera placements , it's unusual , the cinematography and of course Acting contributed largely to build the catharsis up,which was hard to let go for me even after two days.
Joker is not celebrating Crime, it is actually stating the fact that someone turns into a Joker like character after being pushed back, after being bullied, after not getting respected which every individual should be , no matter what he does or how he is.. "

How did she adopt if she was single (in the time this is set doesn't seem likely) where did Arthur go when she was hospitalised how did she get him back... and of course who ARE his real parents. I love that they gave this ""villian"" such a full origin story and well deserved moments of glory in starting an uprising against the wealthy. Hero &amp;villain all in one "

Beautiful shots as well largely contribute to a general feeling, ""Oh, boy, the best two hours of my life.""

2048," Bucket list viewing.
"," I'd been resisting seeing this film for weeks watching others and admittedly not really enjoying any of them. Finally there was nothing else of interest to watch so off we went.
The opening scene of laughter triggered a painfully visceral sense of discomfort. Like being hit with a 2X4 I was awake and focused. Like many others I did not expect this and I did not expect this from Todd Phillips so my bad on both counts. Powerful, moving and brilliant in many respects this seemed like a curtain going up to reveal a whole new form of film making. I couldn't help think of Dostoevsky's ""The Idiot"" and how it could be re-imagined so that today's audiences would flock to it. Using veils such as ""the Joker"" might just be the vehicle to make it work.
I'm also bemused at peoples comparisons to Heath Ledgers Joker. While the connection seems obvious, I'd suggest Ledger and Phoenix's joker should be judged independently as standalone works of creative brilliance.
Strangely I'm suddenly not interested in watching other comic book stories after seeing the Joker be they DC or Marvel.
If you like myself had/have any preconceived ideas, set them aside and see The Joker. "
2049," Decent.
"," It is pretty much what I expected: a decent movie but not a masterpiece by any means.<br/><br/><ul><li>SPOILER FREE PART -</li></ul><br/><br/>The joker is a character study movie about the origins of the character, so of course the movie is entirely centered by him in almost every scene. Joaquin Phoenix I think did a pretty good job considering he plays such a huge role and I can't think of a moment where his acting was off, it all felt very convincing. I like the fact that his laugh was an unconditional mental illness thing and you can really tell that despite the smile he's very pained. You can definitely relate to him at times and feel his sadness, his frustrations, it's all portrayed very well. So hats off to Phoenix, he was one of the best parts of the movie. Aside from maybe two or three characters (and Joker), the remainder cast was very one dimensional and are a bit underdeveloped in a sense, and that's fine I guess considering how much screentime joker gets versus any other character.<br/><br/>In terms of story it's serviceable, it's got its fair share of ""hiccups"" but thankfully not many at the last scenes. It's on the third act where things matter the most for this type of story and in the end that act was incredibly satisfying. I won't mention the details yet, but I'd say what you expect is what you get at the end and it'll leave you very pleased, so look forward to that.<br/><br/>There's something to be said about this movie not having any sense of cleverness or wit, though, as I felt the message was very hammered in, quite literally shouting at your face at times, and there were plenty moments I thought were unnecessary or could use a grain of subtlety. Something less shoehorned that would've make it all the better but instead you're fed information that you already chewed, and fed so in such a gratuitously obvious way that made me go and think to myself,""do they think we're that dense?"". Also since this takes part in Gotham and the DC universe, expect some scenes that you can barely call ""easter-eggs"" of you-know-who, something that felt very forced and REALLY could've been toned down a bit.<br/><br/><ul><li>SPOILER PART -</li></ul><br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the story was with the female love interest character, a neighbor of the main character. I liked the idea that he fantasized (or hallucinated) her there by his side and the fact that she might've represented a person he needed most at his time of need, like during his big comedy gig or at his mom's hospital. Whenever she showed up I was always a little skeptical of it, not entirely fitting the pieces together until a bit before the moment of big reveal. By then I feel like mostly anyone would've figured that out especially when he goes to her apartment and she expresses clear discomfort to his presence, and yet they HAD to include flashback scenes of all the times she wasn't really there, making it painfully obvious by showing a shot of him with her, shot of him not with her, shot of him with her, shot of him not with her.<br/><br/>Speaking of, any of the scenes with Bruce were painfully forced and didn't need to be there at all. It could've very much been an easter egg that this was set in that particular moment in his life, but they had to add so many shots of it. Shot of Joker and young Bruce at the mansion, shot of the Wayne family leaving the cinema. At that point everyone would've known, anyone in the audience knows Batman's backstory after all, but it keeps going. Shot of the Wayne family heading to a dark alleyway. Shot of Protester going the same alleyway and shooting Thomas Wayne. Dramatic shot of young Bruce looking at the dead bodies of his parents. It was just... lame, it's not exciting at all, it's just lame.<br/><br/>The movie also starts with a scene of him dressed up as a clown... holding a sign that says ""everything must go""... and then being beaten by a bunch of kids for no apparent reason. It led me to believe this movie was going to be an egregious experience with just how corny it is. You can make the argument that it's purposely corny but regardless of whether it is or it isn't that scene was one of my least favorite and perhaps something about it could've been re-written.<br/><br/>The final act like I said was very satisfying, having Joker yell at this man who's an ""icon"" of the big screen, for things he's very much justifiable for being mad about was very cathartic. I wouldn't say that his actions were justified but it didn't matter, he's a villain after all, and I enjoyed every second of it. It was very tense, it was very gripping, I loved it.<br/><br/>There are other moments that bothered me a bit, the murder of the three men that immediately led to a protest and a news headline that said nothing but ""KILL THE RICH."" How the Joker entered from this large protest to this fancy building and the music immediately shifts to this stereotypical violin music whose frequencies could probably be translated to ""I AM VERY RICH."" Again, the beginning scene with him as a clown with that sign and being bullied was so corny, etc., etc.<br/><br/>But in the end I'm still very happy with it. I would come back and watch it again especially for that last act. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's acting that was very convincing, other characters like Murray by Robert De Niro were also pretty entertaining. It wasn't exactly as good as I expected it to be but it was still pretty good none the less. Solid 7/10. "
2050," Amazing Joaquin, amazing Joker!

2051," A Bold Mirror, Bravo!
"," Joaquin Phoenix, like every review states, is brilliant. From the macro to the micro- every movement, every gesture he makes as The Joker is perfection. By the end of the film, I could not ignore what I was watching was a clear reflection of what our society is on the verge of right now. Sure, it's extremely exaggerated, but it's hard to miss the parallels between the current political leaders of many nations and The Joker. He is a horrifically mentally ill psychopath who becomes the hero of hoards of misguided people. The Joker could definitely shoot anyone he chooses on 5th Avenue and not only get away with it, but be worshiped for it.<br/><br/>In the end, it isn't The Joker who is scary at all. It's the CULTure of blind-followers who suddenly woke up to to prop up a madman, and none of them even realize he's absolutely out of his mind. Sound familiar? "
2052," Magnificent!
"," What a magnificent film is this!
Particularly compared to the cliche crowd-pleasing films. And even more so compared to the typical super hero movies.
I walked into the cinema with limited expectations, thinking this might just be another crowd-pleasing, CG enhanced, rehash of another super hero story.
Nope! Not at all! The story is fresh, and blunt, and nuanced, and relevant. The story has all these amazing qualities that are not normally present for films in the super hero genre.
Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in it, absolutely, without a doubt. I also particularly appreciate that the director has chosen such a particular story line for the film, positioned the film with a particular direction, and allowed Phoenix to embody the role to this magnificent depth.
The film showed so much promise, that I felt there was still potential to allow even more depth and more grounding, which is why I'm giving it 9, rather than a 10. But, it's an excellent film, and Phoenix could not have done a more perfect job! "

2056," Inevitably Misunderstood
"," What happens when sickness finds itself in a world without physicians?
Joker is a film that asks this question in three images: the individual, how he's treated, and money, in the city. From the outset, Arthur Fleck is presented as a mentally ill individual whose therapist doesn't really listen to him. This is the film's first theme, what are the sciences of the mind supposed to carry out? If there are two kinds of mentally ill subjects: those born sick, and those sickened by our hand, clearly Arthur Fleck is an example of the latter. For those who are born ill, there is admittedly little that can be done. Surely it's a task suited for a scientist. But those corrupted by us, by our idea of education or lack thereof, are creditors to our debt. Precisely in this conundrum lies the heart of the problem in Joker. Can the sick cure the sick? Unlikely. Can the ignorant cure the sick? Still less. The film begs the question, what is psychology and psychiatry?
A science that purports to cure the mind, no less. There was once an art that aspired to this end, the ancient Greeks did their best to perfect it; albeit they didn't call their subject the ""mind"" but the ""soul"". They felt in their bones that to cure the mind is to cure its education, and to cure education is to cure politics, and vice-versa. Keenly aware that the individual depends on the city and the city on the individual, they identified Politics - the art of creating and applying the best laws - as the true means to a healthy city, and Justice (or duty, or ethics) - the art of paying all of one's debts - as the true means to a healthy individual. If we were to ask if the many can be effective at turning unhygienic minds or behaviors into healthy minds and behaviors, we might as well ask if the many can be effective philosophers.
Does Arthur Fleck, then, deserve our sympathy? Not our full sympathy, mainly because in his sorry state he commits matricide. But why did he do this? Anyone watching the film up to that point would agree that he loved his mother dearly. As a famous Genevan philosopher would say: ""Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things, everything degenerates in the hands of man."" Arthur committed this crime because he couldn't reconcile two things he knew to be true: that he was good, and that people had treated him quite badly. Deep down, he knew he was good. He knew he was warm, caring, and decent. His upbringing, a house of horrors thanks to his mother's abusive partner, which he apparently erased from memory, corrupted him. Even if Penny Fleck was lying about Thomas Wayne being Arthur's father, the fact remains that Arthur - a victim - killed in his madness she who was a victim along with him. It's an image not meant to be right, it's meant to be a mirror. What can't be expected from the Joker, or any incurable like him, is healthy behavior, as he himself writes in his journal. How could he be expected to understand what sane people barely do? That the solution to the problem is not violence but adequate understanding, speech, and legitimate means.
Then there is the possibility that Penny was telling the truth about Thomas Wayne; that he did make her sign a non-disclosure agreement; that his power and money swept her case under the rug. In order to understand the film's imagery on money and power, perhaps the best question to start off with is the following. Why did Penny believe Thomas Wayne was the hero of the city? Was he an eminent speaker? Evidently not. It's because what the city values most, what it holds in highest esteem is money. Therefore, a rich man must be city's sage. Trampled and traumatized by this barbarity, it's no surprise that Penny and the rest of the city would conceive of the hero not as he who cultivates reason but he who is rich. The brutality of the city's values shows itself in Arthur's condition - incongruence between what he felt and what he expressed. He was desperate to express himself but was too maimed and mutilated to do so, hence the dancing. The one moment in the film in which he laughs at the laughable, his mother tells him it's not funny. But it's the climax of the film that contains the desperate expression of this idea, he reproaches people for believing that whatever they think is right is what's right. His aesthetic is indeed classic. He doesn't understand why people would think that the truth can be whatever they want it to be. What Arthur would have said if he were healthy is that money unhinged engenders incongruence. When excellence and virtue aren't held in the highest esteem, when they do not inform aesthetics, money will determine values and aesthetic. If any of this seems exaggerated, remember that since 2010 money is considered speech in the United States.
The New York Times, the premier newspaper of the city Gotham is based on, published their star critic's review of the film. In it, A.O. Scott writes: ""To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. Joker, an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that."" I would like to know, what does Mr. Scott know about philosophy? It's not a mean question; rather, one that must be asked because it's an important subject, and important subjects must be treated with utmost care; in some cases, life-long dedication. After all, in order to know what a second-rate version of something is, acquaintance with its first-rate version is required.
That Arthur may be undeserving of our sympathy does not mean Joker is not one of the finest films of our time. It is. It's polarizing effect, how it is so misunderstood, only lends credence to its message. The reason we don't understand Joker, or at least don't know what to do with it, is the very same reason why the Joker was born, the same reason this character is an image of what's wrong in the modern city. Ignorance cannot cure ignorance, and nobody can cure a city that doesn't want to be cured. "
2057," One of the finest peformance in recent time....
"," Joker is almost a perfect movie...with very few flaws. It is indeed very disturbing, haunting and scary at a times. As movie is filled with violence and based on controversial issues where some may have issues with the way it is presented. The ensemble cast give great boost to the characters but one man who rules above all is phoenix the face behind the joker. He potrays the character of joker giving it all blood , sweat and tears. It wont be of any surprise if his bags get filled with trophies for his career best peformance. It's rare to see such a brilliant peformance where one can hardly move an eye from him. The story begins on a strong note, the flim has no dull moments at all except only few scenes where the storyline seems a bit forced. The story builds up with lots of revelations, heart pounding moments and an exciting climax. The background music fits completely with the flow of the movie. The movie is definitely one of the best of year 2019, there is no denying it. But the actor phoenix who plays the titular character of joker will be remembered for the years to come. The Movie is not completely flawless but the role of joker presented on screen is itself a masterpiece hence it deserves a 10/10 rating...... "

"," From the beginning to the end, Joker will take you through a journey on how a person can be taken to the brink of insanity. Oscar worthy performance for Joaquin Phoenix, great score, perfect cinematography. Definitely will be part of my collection of great movies you can watch again and again. "
2059," Not as expected
", The actor is really good performing the joker but the story is a little off . 
2060," Disturbing piece of art
"," This is probably the most disturbing movie I've ever watched. Our point of view in this movie , shows us how society behaves , in the most extreme way.
Joker is no perfect , but so are the people who treat him the way they do. Such a great movie , this is going to last forever. "
2061," Joaquin Phoenix is defiantly the master peace here
"," The film itself is not remarkable . having said that i am not a super hero movies fan in fact the only one i saw was the dark knight because of obviously Heath Ledger , but this movie was a bit slow based to a point that bores you and again Joaquin comes and grebes you with his amazing acting skills and the way he shifts his face and his voice is just so mesmerizing . although i think he had a huge responsibility taking the role after the late one but he was fantastic in it that i allowed my self not the compare the two . i said to my brother when we were getting out of the cinema that the first made you despise the joker and the later made you feel for him and amazingly justify what he did "
2062," Not sure I would call it a masterpiece, but I did love it.
", Everything that comes to mind about the film was phenomenal. The cinematography was my favorite part; and felt like the world was closing in on Juaquin Phoenix without feeling too shut in. Several scenes including buildings whose walls extended to the skies that surrounded and closed in on the Joker set the perfect tone throughout. A few directions they took during the film made you question their direction; but by the end of the movie those uncertainties made the film more memorable and eerily satisfying. The performance of Phoenix and the cinematography would absolutely cause me to give this a rewatch in the future. 
2063," Does it help to be so picky?
"," It's disgusting how hard critics tried to devalue the movie. Things that are not supposed to be criticized went under harsh beating. Historical accuracy and loyalty to the origin? Boring.<br/><br/>We're talking about a made-up story in a made-up world. It's so simple you don't even have to know who Joker is to enjoy the show. Mental health issues and how common they are, on the other hand, is something you'd better be aware of.<br/><br/>Surely, in the way how all the events play out, it's not the best fiction. You refuse to believe things like this could happen in real life, yet it's a pleasure. Everything is exaggerated and, at the same time, quite entertaining and touching. "
2064," It's a tragedy
"," After seeing Joker, it kept me up late into the night. It's certainly an unsettling film. It differentiates itself from the rest of the villain- centric comic book films, like Suicide Squad or Venom, by not providing any counter force to the bad guy. In Venom and Suicide Squad those who usually would be the villains are faced off against someone who is a bigger villain and by the end of the film they're almost become the heroes. In Joker however, there are no heroes. The tone is somber throughout the film and there are practically no elements to invoke any positive feelings.<br/><br/>Joker's real name here is Arthur Fleck and he's played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix. He brings his own flavor into the role and his performance is very physical. Not only did he lose weight for the role, but his movement, like his dancing, which there is surprisingly lot in Joker, is captivating. Joker is a standalone film from the rest of the DC Universe films and it tells the story, although borrowing cues from other famous movies, of how Arthur becomes the Joker. Whether intentional or not (although I doubt that due to Robert DeNiro's character) to me Joker resembles mostly Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy, taken only further to the extreme.<br/><br/>Like Rupert Pupkin in King of Comedy, Arthur Fleck in Joker is delusional and socially clumsy outsider who wants to be a famous comedian. He's not a edgy master criminal here. Arthur also admires a late-night host, played by Robert DeNiro. Like Pupkin, Arthur believes his destined to be on the stage, only that he hasn't had his deserved big break yet. Only problem is that Arthur doesn't seem to understand other people or what people generally find funny. Or maybe it's his lack of talent. In Joker, much emphasize is put on the fact that Arthur suffers from mental illness like his mother, whom he cares for. Arthur suffers from a condition which makes him laugh involuntarily. This makes it even more difficult for him to connect with anyone as he may laugh in very inappropriate situations.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the violence and the depiction of a mentally ill person in Joker. It is indeed a violent film but compared to the likes of its role models such as Taxi Driver, it's nothing new under the sun. Maybe when compared to other comic book -based films, its violence and bleak atmosphere might seem like something new. However, as an actual social commentary Joker and its world feels too simplified. It leans its juxtaposition on the old poor vs the rich elite environment. It would be easy to say that the film is a warning of what neglected care for the mentally ill and the increasing wealth cap would cause, but to me it's just an environment where the film takes place. Sure, there are riots, mentally ill, rich and poor people in the real world too. But does it say anything meaningful of it? I don't think so. The idea that the films version of Gotham is an accurate depiction of today's society and where violence and murder are acceptable and admirable solutions to hardships in life is just too cynical and not all the way thought interpretation. Rather, the whole movie is about Arthur and his desire and inability to connect with the world, which in the end comes to pass in ironically twisted way.<br/><br/>Joker is by no means a subtle movie. It constantly reminds the viewer of the bleak Gotham City in which Arthur lives and of the state of Artur's mental wellbeing. The world around Arthur is bleak and sometimes cruel. Everything bad that happens to Arthur seems to happen without his fault. All he wants to do is to bring laughter and joy into this world. He displays a sort of child- like innocence, which makes it easy to side with him. It's very manipulative, but admittedly effective. But once things start to take a turn for the worse when Arthur shoots three Wayne Investment employees after being assaulted by them in the subway, the sympathy I felt turned into pity. It's this stark turn that the film takes that makes it captivating. This contradiction also applies to the film's soundtrack, where its original tracks are very melancholic compared to some other old classics which are heard. As Arthur dances in a shady restroom after his first murders I realized that I do not understand him. What Arthur does in the film is no way excusable. He may have tried to defend himself on the subway by firing his gun, but then he starts to hunt down the other two. This isn't a story of Arthur discovering his true self or becoming what he was meant to be by taking on the name Joker, but rather it's about Arthur losing his way. This is a Joker I don't see going head to head with the Dark Knight. In fact, I don't see any future for Arthur.<br/><br/>Joker isn't as dangerous film as it's claimed to be. Sure, it's intense and violent, and it's easy to draw some slim parallels between its world and the real world, but they are too vague and general that they do not contribute to anything. I also do not accept the idea that the film incites people to violence. In the film Arthur gains following through his acts of killing, but it speaks to the tragedy that he couldn't gain attention by bringing laughter and joy to the world, but instead through acts of violence and becoming uncivil himself.<br/><br/>Joker from time to time goes out of its way to remind the viewer that it takes place in the Batman universe. Some familiar names drop by here and there, but I still don't see, nor do I care to see a sequel where Arthur goes up against the Caped Crusader. The ending attempts to leave you guessing whether anything you saw on the screen was real or not, but it doesn't really matter. Although I'm leaning towards the former. That's much I want Joker to be its own self-contained film in this era of comic book films where a movie is more concerned about building towards a sequel rather trying to tell a proper story. "
2065," Not A Masterpiece, But Impressive
",
2066," 10/10 great movie. Loved it. Will see it again, forget the dopes!
"," As of writing this there are 317,711 IMDB user votes, of which 9,654 are below 6/10.<br/><br/>That's 3% of people that hated this film... for every 100 people, 3 people are C U N T S.<br/><br/>Sounds about right in this day and age.<br/><br/>10/10 great movie. Loved it. Will see it again, forget the dopes! "
2067," Disconnect
"," In short, this is a decent drama about mental illness that, for some unfathomable reason, plays with the DC universe and the Joker character, although it shouldn't have. This Joker has little to nothing to do with all the previous incarnations we've seen so far, and the whole story kind of falls to pieces once you look away from the main character and consider the bigger picture.<br/><br/>Also, as a side note: please stop it with the continuous (although more often than not unwarranted) reboots of entire universes/franchises and ""re-geneses"" of characters... I can understand the need to remarket a ""product"" to make it appealing again to new audiences, tastes and fads, and make more money out of it, but this is becoming ridiculous... (3 totally different Jokers in 10 years...)<br/><br/>6.5/7 out of 10 (as a drama/crime story revolving around mental illness) "
2068," a must watch movie
", Yes it is indeed a great movie with an excellent performance by Phoenix. The script is well written so that the evolutionary path from a good guy to the bad guy is very convincing. Consequently you cannot help yourself but to sympathize with the villain.<br/><br/>The only less convincing part is the studio scene after he admits a murder. If a guy dressed in a clown tells me he shot three people I as a talk show host would either not believe him or - if I believed him - immediately call for security and not continue talking with him. But appart from that small detail - a must watch movie. 
2069," He is crazy...
"," Instead of watching him acting crazy, I saw a crazy guy in the movie. Can't shake off his performance from my mind even a few hours after walking out of the cinema....Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the Oscar! "
2070," Fulfills in practicality, falls short in narrative
"," When one views this film for the first time, they'll be amazed at the film elements that make it up: cinematography, sound (especially the intelligent usage of music), Mise en scene. An area in which this film is almost perfect in is the performance of the lead Joaquin Phoenix- a performance that almost makes you forget the flaws in the narrative itself. Simply put, the social issues that Joker tries to tackle are tedious and superfluous. But I must praise this film for how it structures its narrative, because when you're viewing it in the moment, you never realise its flaws. But overtime, you will understand the holes that Joker pokes in it's story. A film that will likely be remembered not for it's narrative, but for the man who plays Arthur Fleck. "
2071," Good old Dark DC
"," If you liked watchmen, you would love this.
Meaningful. "
2072," Unmissable
", Phoenix is superb. The film is awesome. There're not many films I would pay to go back and see but this is one. I despise superhero films with a passion...this is NOT one. It's in a class of its own. 
2073," Decent descent into a demented mind
"," ""Joker"" is good. Joaqu√≠n does an excellent job as lifelong punching bag, Arthur Fleck. He lives with his unwell mother, caring for her and working as a clown for hire. He dreams of being a stand up comedian, working with his hero, Murray Franklin (played by Robert de Niro). But life has other plans. A childhood of abuse and neglect has caused Arthur some serious mental and social issues. But is it his ill health or the ill health of society that will be change him into the clown prince?<br/><br/>""joker"" played well with ambiguity throughout its runtime. Besides the obvious laugh at inopportune moments, Arthur's mental state, heritage and fate are all cataclysmically mixed up in truth and lie. Where the joke begins and ends depends on the viewer. Even in its final moments, red footprints contrasting the dizzying peace of the blissful scene, its hard to know what has happened just moments before. Todd ""the hangover"" Phillips keeps a tight hold on Arthur's story throughout in his direction. The beautiful colour palettes and wondrous gaze of a camera lingering on moments of extreme violence is captivating, to be sure.<br/><br/>However, Phillips' style over substance can onyy take him so far and where the film flops is in its decision to dig through the dirt of joker's origin story. Far too streamlined, the film seems to be more interested in ticking boxes on its way to a conclusion, rather than doing anything new. Perhaps his accidental rise to figurehead of a generation disillusioned by disparate wealth is a realistic approach instead of ""falls into toxic vat, comes back as criminal mastermind"" but none of the charm of the established Joker is present here. Hes just a sad sack with mental health problems. Even a turning point at the beginning of the final act in which he states hes ""not wrong, this is who I've always been"" feels untrue. Joker is a maniac and genius. I wish there had been more hints at his troubled but wonderfully corrupt mind throughout, instead of a final rant that gets cut short.<br/><br/>Phillips aimed high, and the cast certainly pulled their weight, but the story, for such an enigmatic, charismatic villain of lore just does not do the source material justice. "
2074," Joaguin Phoenix is on another level !
"," Best joker I've ever seen. Simply the masterpiece.
the actor Joaquin is whorthy an oscar. "
2075," WoW!!!!
", Phoenix deserves an Oscar!!! ... his acting was outstanding!! 
2076," Exactly what we needed.
"," I understand the reasons for this movie sitting as a center for controversy, but for it's purpose of putting you in the shoes of a broken sociopath, you should expect nothing less than to feel uncomfortable. And it made me feel uncomfortable, in a way I wouldn't have dared to resist. I knew that experiencing his emotions would not only come with feelings of defeat and brokenness, but also the waking terror of a supervillain. It was perfect as an introduction for such a dark and derranged character, and shouldn't be seen as any less; Joker, as Pheonix or Ledger, will never be underestimated again with the new insight provided to his personal life. "

"," Unlike any other R rated movie I've seen. The violence is so unsettling, shocking, realistic, shot and edited so well, and with the addition of that score, it really makes you uncomfortable as if you were seeing a real life footage. Demands your attention from start to finish, no second is wasted. And yeah Joaquin is gonna win an Oscar "
2080," PERFECT!

The scene on the stairs it was absolutely amazing
The final scene when he was above the police car OMG!!
Absolutely beautiful "
2081," Perfection
"," I was one of those people who were really sceptical about Joaquin Phoenix(because I never watched his movies before) and his looks as Joker. But after seeing the movie Isaw how wrong I was and especially after the scene when criminals put unconscious Joker on a police car, it really reminded me of Arkham Citys ending. All in all excellent, unsettling, horrifying movie, it even tackles some social questions that should be more discussed in movies, I would really recommend it to everyone. "
2082," One of the Best movies of the Best movies of decade
", This Man deserves an Oscar soundtracks also the best that can ve. 
2083," Stunning, with some irritations
"," Phoenix is brilliant, the whole feeling of the movie is just great, dark, and gritty. Just as it should be. But it's not a 10 for me, because I think it lacks in the scripting of the supporting characters; some feel really forced, just to give Fleck his stepstones. This contrast to his detailed portrait irritated me quite a lot.
But nevertheless, it's a must-see. "
2084," ""Joker"" is no joke.
"," This is the kind of film that won't seize to creep up and haunt you for days or perhaps even weeks after you've first seen it... It definitely brought out the ""philosopher"" in me. I found myself asking the universe all kinds of questions about human behaviour..
What makes a man crack under pressure?
What drives a man to lose his sanity and commit vicious crimes?
Is society at all to blame?
If so, what's it's contribution?<br/><br/>The laws of physics state that most substances known to man either have a boiling or melting point. All substances, once subjected to certain pressures or temperatures, either melt, freeze, liquidize, sublimate or simply decompose.<br/><br/>A man's mind, psyche or sanity is actually no different in that manner.<br/><br/>This is a film about a man's inner struggle to cope with his unfortunate and miserable life and the tragic chain of events which inevitably lead him to experience an emotional meltdown.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck, ""Joker"", is a ""monster"" created solely by society. He's victimized throughout his entire childhood and adult life by everybody surrounding him, including his own mother.<br/><br/>Arthur suffers from a serious mental condition due to severe a physical head injury and mental trauma that was inflicted upon him during his early childhood, causing him to uncontrollably burst out into laughter whilst under mental duress.<br/><br/>With this mental condition in mind, Arthur works as an underpaid clown on the verge of poverty, living with and caring for his elderly mother, alienated and outcasted by society and his peers at work, neglected by social services due to budget cutbacks, deprived of his daily prescribed medications, continuously humiliated, assaulted, beaten and battered by cruel people of Gotham City, left lying and bleeding on the ground in alleyways and subways like an injured animal, defamed and ridiculed on national television and dissuaded by his own mother.<br/><br/>Life and reality as Arthur knows it have become much too overwhelming for him to deal with. He's like a ""ticking time bomb"" ready to explode at any given moment. The writing is on the wall. He eventually cracks - totally freaks out, losing complete control of himself and goes off on a killing spree.<br/><br/>Though Arthur's actions are strongly condemned and CAN NEVER BE justified, it's quite difficult not to feel any empathy whatsoever towards him. Indeed, Todd Phillipps, the film's director, succeeded by intentionally instilling that thought in his viewers which continues to linger in their minds long after the movie is over...<br/><br/>In my opinion, Joaquin Phoenix delivers the greatest performance of his acting career and well deserves an Oscar Academy Award for it. ""Joker"" is a true masterpiece of cinematography.<br/><br/>My suggestion is.. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a big favor and go!! "
2085," Inspiring!
"," Such a breath of fresh air after 6 stuffy avengers movies with a bunch of grumpy faced captain america. finally a happy super hero movie. never felt like i related more to a character more in my life. Jaquin Phoenix, always considered the man brilliant. now hes a legend. "
2086," Film of the year
"," In the last 30-45 minutes pheonix's performance is awesome.Oscar is waiting for you phoenix.
And director played great work in the end by providing the most emotional scene in *DC* (i.e.,Thomas and Martha's death while Bruce is watching) which can stop a person ,who is changing in psychopath by imaging himself as joker (while watching this movie).
And question- *Is there a chance that we can see joker(Joaquin phoenix) in Batman 2021,like in post credits or something?* "

The critics who gave it bad reviews need to go back and rewatch this film...no idea what some of these critics were thinking. Wildly entertaining, powerful and captivating. "
2091," This is easily the movie of the year.
"," I left the theater speechless. This is a perfect movie, I dare to say this is one of the best films of the decade. This is not another empty superhero movie, this is art and elegance.<br/><br/>It MUST win an Oscar, at least for Joaquin Phoenix. Otherwise, I'll never believe im those awards again. "
2092," Brilliant, Raw and intriguing take on The Joker.
"," The movie is dark, it's gritty and intense at times. Its a movie that gets the discussion going on so many questions that we ask within society today. Todd Phillips has done such a sublime job he not only handled the entire movie with care and attention to detail but he raised topics that are still being spoken and debated about today. Joaquin was perfection, DONT go into this thinking it's going to be the in the same realm as Heath Ledgers Joker it's so different. Almost like two different genres.<br/><br/>Overall this is the best movie I've seen 2019, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. It's slower burner of a movie and the pay off is brilliant.<br/><br/>10/10.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic route for DC to follow. Stay on this path. "
2093," DC released the Clown...
"," Fantastic movie, Joaquin is the Joker to the tee. It's an emotional ride that makes you feel sorry for him and relate to people with metal illnesses etc.<br/><br/>I salute the Director/writers for this and Joaquin should walk out with all the Oscars.<br/><br/>I would love them to bring him into the next Batman movie!

It is the most realistic film ever made for a superhero universe. Not only the existence of the Joker, but also dangerous Gotham and the murder of the Waynes make much more sense now than in the usual simplistic moralist explanations. Superb movie!

"," Joker is a movie that demands to be seen more than once. It is gruesome, strange, shocking, and amazing. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/ the joker, and he definitely deserves an Oscar for this performance. Robert De Niro has a great performance, although he has very little screen time. The visuals in this movie are one of the best parts. Every shot looks like a beautifully crafted photo. The score is also amazing (I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is one part that genuinely gave me goosebumps because of the score). The soundtrack is okay, and while it is fine, it feels a little manipulative at one point. The script is... okay. The dialogue is fine, but it feels like what is happening and the sequence of events is only okay, and feels overtly obvious at parts (you'll see what I mean). "

2102," Instant classic!

2103," Exhilarating from start to finish.
"," It is very rare that a film can have a long lasting affect on you, well this is that rare occurrence! I have seen this twice now and it has had a long lasting affect.<br/><br/>The film depicts the struggle of a man who's suffered child hood trauma, mental health issues and isolation, this is what Society chooses to ignore not just relevant in Gotham but today's modern society.<br/><br/>Jaoquins performance blew me away and surely will win an Oscar. He made the audience feel each seen and the tension and emotion was palpable. The excellent music composer helps to add a further layer of suspense alongside the cinematography which was dark and dull to match the mood.<br/><br/>Not only do I recommend as this will be etched into cinematic greatness but I feel it's a great thought provoking movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion he bettered heaths joker performance but it's definitely alongside it. The ending in which the bravado of the joker comes out, the mood changes to one of happiness when he feels noticed and accepted by society. "
2104," OMG!!!!
", That is all I could start with Joaquin is a wonderful joker and should stay the joker in any future movies that would have to star a joker hands down he's now my number 1 favorite joker I'm sorry and R.I.P always Heath ledger is my second my third is now Jared leto and so on I was upset when I first found out about them making the joker movie without jared leto and Margot Robbie they should make one with them two again they did were wonderful together but this blows all the other ones OUT OF THE WATER!!! Joaquin bravo and what a awesome job you did stan lee would have been proud I hope it had a small amount of violence which my husband loved but made me sick thats just not my style but I still give it two thumbs up and and million praises i want to make sure everyone watches this damn good film fantastic job everyone who was involved ü§°

"," But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. I went in knowing it wasn't about Batman and anything D.C. but I didn't think it was this deep and dark.<br/><br/>Phoenix better get some awards for this movie. He truly portrayed a man with serious mental illness and the effort he took to lose that weight definitely enhanced his role.<br/><br/>It's a drama. It's not exciting and suspenseful.

2108," An intense buildup of a mentally broken character
"," An intense buildup of a mentally broken character, slowly mutating, from the environment that surrounds him and from himself, into the world's famous Joker. This movie is not for everyone, its a carefully crafted piece of art both shocking and slow to unveil, which many may not like. However, these two parts really make the movie. The slowness gives you an appreciation for the impeccable and subtle characterization by Joaquin and connects you in a better way to the pain and suffering of Arthur, the character. Its shocking nature allows for a constant back and forth between sympathizing with his struggles and repulsing his actions, while at the same time, understanding the stance he ultimately finds himself in. Everything pieced together with great music, sound, ambient, and acting. Special congratulations to Joaquin Phoenix who steals the show, as it should be. He created a very intriguing character that while connected with the Joker persona, doesn't resemble any of the character's previous interpretations, therefore making this his unique and personal take. "

Fact of the matter, we witnessed a little more than we signed up for. Joaquin phoenix delivered a new standard for acting, embracing a complex dramatic ascension of the Joker character throughout the movie, shedding focus on the horrendous truth of the society we live in. The tragedy was so intense I couldn't hold my tears in some scenes, but as the Joker said ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy"". "
2121," From Taxi Driver to the Joker
"," Thoughts of Travis Bickle came into my head on viewing this movie. The dissension into violence and detachment from society oozed into the dark corners of this movie.This is a movie of today.

There are few movie out there that you can say you'd love to see again and pick up on all the little ""breadcrumb "" left for us to follow. I'm buzzing writing this review because those of us who saw the movie will be speaking of it in days/weeks to come and those of us who haven't will just have to read so much about it. Please go out and see this movie it make us think of what society neglect will come back to us in spades. ""Joker"" is a social commentary of our lack of treatment of the mentally ill.

"," All I can say is that I never felt so much sympathy for a villain like the Joker in this movie because beside all the evil which awakes more and more in him he is a victim in the end. His life started under the worst circumstances but the final burning mark is given by a ruthless, exploiting society where your social background determines the rest of your life.<br/><br/>Acting is superb. Joaquin Phoenix found his destiny in this role.<br/><br/>After watching this movie I saw an imaginary line in the end credits ""This movie is dedicated to all the lost and tortured souls out there"". I feel like there is a part of this villain within me. I finally managed to control my inner demons so I could escape a dark future. Arthur Fleck failed in a sad but not surprising way. "
2124," Oscar for Joaquin!
"," I didn't expect too much from this movie! How wrong I was! What an awesome acting! And I think it's the best Joker, with all respect for Heath Ledger! Joaquin deserves Oscar for this role! "
2125," The masterpiece
"," One of the best movies I have watched in a long long time. Reflecting todays world, full of selfishness. Joaquin is amazing! Oscar is waiting for this movie! "
2126," Wow what a film
"," I've never felt compelled enough to write a review about a movie before but this film has made me feel the need to do so.<br/><br/>The setting for this film was just perfect and I was engrossed from minute one. Phoenix portrayal of the ""Joker"" was just sublime, he deserves every last bit of credit for bringing this character to life once again on the big screen.<br/><br/>Having said that I feel that it's not all about Phoenix but the supporting cast all have such a big part to play in the development of The jokers character.<br/><br/>I think it is an Oscar worthy film with Oscar worthy performances. The picture, the score, the acting are all beyond amazing! "

", After long time I saw a performance which actually hit your mind directly and tells you what is the feeling of a person if society doesn't recognize him. 
2135," Enjoyed It
"," Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Joker. I liked how it truly showed Arthur Fleck going more and more insane throughout the film. A good example would be him imagining that his next door neighbor is his girlfriend, only to find out later in the film that it was all in his head. Joaquin Phoenix was also amazing in this film and he completely owned the role of the joker.<br/><br/>The only criticism that I have with this film is that it feels like a newly done Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy crossover. I believe that director of The Hangover, Todd Phillips really enjoys that era of Scorsese. Fair enough, Taxi Driver is an amazing movie and it inspires me. That doesnt mean I am going to make a movie that is almost a copy of Taxi Driver, with only some sequences and characters changed.<br/><br/>Although I have this gripe with the movie, I still really enjoyed it and I thought the sets, cinematography and Joaquin Phoenix were amazing in this. I would recommend seeing this. "
2136," Masterpiece is an understatement
"," Yes. Just saying film is a masterpiece is an understatement and Joaquin &amp; Todd deserves better. The Dark Knight was a masterpiece, but Joker not only beat my expectations, it gives me real hope that going forward we can have real movies "
2137," What a different kind of movie.
"," Joker is a different type of movie, finally something original. The actor was superb.
I believe the movie should be called Arthur, but Joker simply sells more. "
2138," Hard to watch in the best kind of way
"," This take on the joker is fresh and new. Taking a man rittled with mental illnesses and putting him into a broken Gotham City. This takes the joker to a different level... Slowly taking Arthur Fleck and driving him more and more insane, until the city, ""gets what it deserves""<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is extraordinary... You believe he has these real conditions and you feel so bad for him in the stressful situations that he is put into due to his pathological laughing disorder.<br/><br/>While watching the film it was hard to watch in a good way. You didn't want to look away as Arthur was slowly driven insane from getting treated like trash and finding his mother lied to him his whole life.<br/><br/>People who enjoy Batman's nemesis ""the joker"" character from the comics will also enjoy this movie. They tie in Bruce Wayne into this without going over the top with it. People who like just plain out good movies that don't feel like they are plastered with superheroes everywhere will also enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Recommend seeing this. "
2139," Feeling like the other guy!
"," I guess thats about it, the title of my review. Thats why I understand when people google *is Joker movie disturbing?* . Tod Philips managed to make us feel like the other guy, a mentally ill guy who was thrown into the society. Felt that all the time up to the end when all became Joker and all understood whats it like to feel like the other guy. "

"," This film was close to perfect. The character arch was phenomenal and Joaquin's performance was excellent throughout the film, with his odd ticks and the way he used his body to show emotion that the character couldn't articulate. You could see his journey to becoming the Joker so clearly and everything made sense and clicked the moment you were shown it on screen. One after another you started to see the peices build until the Joker was complete. This unique story of following a troubled man's decent into one of the most famous villain of all time is well worth a watch.<br/><br/>Congrats to everyone involved in this masterpiece. "
2166," Masterpiece
"," This movie had wonderful storytelling, beautiful camera work, amazing direction, great acting, phenomenal product. It shows us the reality up close and personal. People who are leaving negative reviews are mostly incapable to make a masterpiece like this and/or are Marvel fanboys. Don't get me wrong I like Marvel too but when it comes to the joker or Batman we put aside our differences. Great watch, money worth. "
2167," A very uplifting movie !
"," This movie was a bit different from what I had expected yo see, in that, for a movie about a joker there are very few jokes, and very little humor. It is still very worth seeing, though. It does address the very real and pressing issue of income inequality, and the feelings of isolation and futility that many people feel today. These are really the most moving scenes of the movie, and the ones that really cast Arthur in the role of the every man we can all relate to. The way that he becomes an icon to all of his ""clown"" admirers, especially toward the end of the movie, was the most uplifting part of the movie. The fact that there is a scene that is very similair to the one shown in the original 1989 Batman film makes this film both a Batman and Joker origin story. The back ground music, cinematography, screenplay, and nost of all the acting by Mr Phoenix, and Mr. DeNiro a must see for all adult fans of the batman super hero genre. "
2168," MOVIE OF THE YEAR. A MUST SEE!!!
"," This is a must see if you love drama and psychological thrillers. I can't even find the words to describe it. I don't usually feel strongly about movies but this one just struck a cord with me. The hype is real. If Joaquin Pheonix doesn't win ALL the awards for this movie.... you know the game is rigged. ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. The film doesn't encourage violence, it encourages the exact opposite; human kindness. Something so simple could have changed the entire course of Arthur Fleck's life. Don't believe what the negative liberal media has to say about this. Watch and see for yourself that Joker is an absolute MASTERPIECE. "
2169," Wow Joaquin Phoenix Meet Heath Ledger
"," Going into this Movie, I honestly just couldn't wait. Obviously for the fact the the Joker is my Favorite comic book Villain, but also knowing Phoenix, the most underrated actor in Hollywood, would play the Clown Prince of Crime.<br/><br/>My excitement after watching the movie became shocked, my expectations were excited...Phoenix did it, he entered the Ledger Conversation.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Arthur(Joker) on all aspects of the movie. It details on how a person, who has just had enough of being a laughing stock from society, mentally disturbed, creates his own persona.<br/><br/>The powerful Scenes this movie has, from The first kills, Joker touching Young Bruce Wayne's(Batman) face, other killings, and finally, becoming the agent of Chaos, and it's all from the Masterful Phoenix.<br/><br/>Well done Joaquin, Heath would be Smiling and Laughing from the Craft. "
2170," Best film of 2019!
"," Words can't describe how great this film is. It is one of those films you have to watch for yourself and is a breath of fresh air from your usual summer blockbuster superhero and action movies. There are a lot of deep, underlying themes and messages in this movie, and might require multiple viewings to fully understand this kind of film which plays a lot like a psychological drama/thriller. Please go and watch this if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed! "
2171," Perfect!
", It's fair to say that was one of the best acting perfomances of the history. A unique experience is provided for movie lovers. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. No. The Oscar needs Joaquin Phoenix after this movie! 
2172," Delivers something rare
"," Joaquin Phoenix's performance alone deserves the 9 rating. Everything this movie has to say is incredible, whether or not it's in a good or bad connotation is left to the viewer, but incredible nonetheless. Even if watched just for the Joker origin story, it still delivers amazingly from an entire production. "
2173," Film of the year
"," SUCK IT MARVEL, better than Endgame ( CHUPA MARVEL) "
2174," Speechless
"," This movie is an absolute masterpiece. It left me wondering about everything happening in my life, it makes you think about things.<br/><br/>While some people say it 'emphasises on violence' and how it can 'activate people to become violent' , I believe that this movie is doing the opposite: showing that we have to respect everybody in society. The joker wouldn't have existed if there was nobody who rejected him.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful message. Just go and watch it. For me it's the best movie I've ever seen "
2175," Don't pay attention to the media, see this film
"," This movie is literally a beauty. Made well. Every shot is like art. Very fine attention to detail. Hard to pick anything bad with this film. And I've left out the best part, the acting. Joaquin does a fantastic job. You aren't seeing him, you are seeing Arthur fleck. He portrays a man with a mental illness so well it's scary. This is the best dc film since the dark knight and I really hope folks give it a chance. The violence is very earned and so is the subtle quiet moments. Never gets boring or slow. Pacing is excellent. Please see this film "
2176," Loved it!
"," This is not your average super-villain movie. I also get why people don't like it. People don't want to sympathize with a deranged killer suffering from mental illness, but if it made you uncomfortable than the movie did its job wonderfully. Phoenix delivered in my opinion an oscar winning performance. I hope there is a sequel! "
2177," Do yourself a favor
"," I attended a late night showing last night and let me just say, you could here a pen drop in the theater when the credits rolled. (In a good way)
So many people right now are trying to find some political message in this, there isn't one. It's an intense character study about a troubled individual. Don't be afraid of the news, go watch for yourself. "
2178," UNBELIEVABLE
", This movie is a masterpiece!!! I do not have words to describe Phoenix's acting! He deserves 1000 oscars for this.

2182," A pleasant surprise from Todd Philips
"," This is one of the best movies I ever seen. I would never have guessed Todd Philips would be able to pull off something like this. The pace is perfect for a movie who aims to introduce a new character into the universe. And what a character, so different from Nolan's Joker but so perfect and original. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an outstanding performance, probably his best. "

2185," DEEP
"," Went in the cinema to see a hyped up movie, left with an existential crisis. This is a brilliantly portrayed character that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. The way the society has evolved in Gotham is not far from the society in any other big non-fictional city and this really makes me think about the future. ""Be kind, everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about.""
*Oscar-worthy perfomance by Joaquin Phoenix. "
2186," ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE

2189," Amazing movie
", What most people don't understand is that a social problem is dealt with here is wonderful how this is filmed and how the joker is played this is more like class! I looked at it with full praise. I have never left a comment in the years that I am a member and active here but this was worth it. 
2190," Disturbingly good

2191," A realistic creatikn of the joker
"," A great view and realistic approach of the creation of the joker. I was one who didnt think anyone could be the joker after Heath, but Pheonix did an amazing job! "
2192," What A Performance
"," I was skeptical at first about this movie when I first heard that they were going to be producing a solo Joker film. But after viewing the trailer numerous times, I realized this could be one of those hit or miss films. This film for me was a hit, everything from the acting to the cinematography. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece, and is a fine representation of why the film industry in America is known as the best. Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job as the joker. Truly a gut wrenching performance, which could be argued by many as a Oscar worthy performance. Truly this film is one of the greatest films produced in 2019. "
2193," wtf wtf joker character and jack phoenix are made for each other

"," A masterpiece. Mr Phoenix what a performance . A man pushing down by the society. Stand for himself a last and defend the negative people around him. I must say very realistic,also I feel sorry about that neighbor girl . I was hoping a least this went well,but that's was only his imagination. Such a shame... great escape from reality "
2199," AMAZING
"," I saw this film twice in two days and I loved it. I was gripped and at the edge of my seat all the way through. Joaquin played a brilliant part, he mastered the true essence of what the Joker should be. People complaining that it is too dark and depressing, it's meant to be! Seeing the truth behind the mental illness and the treatment from the government showed the effects the system can have on someone. Highly recommend seeing this film "
2200," Actual cinema for a change. Compelling film with a compelling performance by Phoenix
"," This film looks likes and is ...cinema. I really didn't think they that any more. it's probably due to the setting in a grim but intensely real Gotham City, which has never been more like a truly unattractive new york (without the landmarks of course).<br/><br/>Joachim Phoenix is understated but mesmerising. Fundamentally vulnerable for much of the movie, his becoming is slow but inexorable. He won't be become quite the Joker you're used to, but be assured he will become the Joker, one with a great deal more depth than we've had before.<br/><br/>In a sense that's part of why the film's met with some mixed critical responses. Some of the critical voices have been quite vocal in condemning not the film so much as the 'wrong message' they feel it conveys. While the film certainly doesn't glamorise the violence in the Joker, since it explains it from the inside, it does make us sympathise fundamentally with the character, a rare feat given that he is portrayed as an abused, socially awkward, mentally ill loner, the kind who society mainly hears about when like in the Joker they decide to do something to be remembered by. The fear being articulated in other words is that the film with it's portrayal of a cathartic explosion of violence by the socially rejected will inspired others to follow.<br/><br/>People sometimes are inspired by films to act out, in good ways and bad, but fears like that seem misplaced &amp; betray one of the worst aspects of modern movie-making, namely, that much of it seems to involve very conscious efforts at social control. Angry loners have been doing angry loner things for a long time and an actual study into why human explosions do happen, the discovery of what it's like to be on the other side of the glass so to speak, probably isn't going to make things much better or worse, except insofar as understanding people and what makes them tick, what makes them angry or sad etc is generally something which makes the world better rather than worse.<br/><br/>Moreover the issues also touches on one of the reasons the movie works: because so much of our entertainment &amp; media is made with a conscious awareness of what kind of effect it's supposed to have, what sort of message we, in other words, are supposed to get, we are increasingly left with what often feels like synthetic experiences, involving synthetic feelings, where we are supposed to feel angry or happy, agree or disagree etc on cue. The Joker avoids this kind of socially responsible paint by numbers cinema and for that reason, almost bizarrely given that it's a Batman origin movie within a comic book superhero genre, it feels real, fundamentally authentic.<br/><br/>Whether the film makes the world a better or worse place remains to be seen, but ultimately, movies are only supposed to make the world a better place because they are works of art or vision or something approaching that. Having said that many great works of cinema really have been politically or socially subversive &amp; there probably is something of that in this film too. Not only do we have a controversial hero/anti-hero but we also have his identification with the little guy (literally in one scene) within the context of the depiction of social anger &amp; mass uprising against the rich, that more than a little seems to evoke the barely covered by the news mass protests in france for instance, not to mention populist feeling articulated against out of touch 'elites' within the wider international political system.<br/><br/>The depiction in places of quasi-revolutionary violence, which in the context of the Batman universe, we have always previously been led to believe was a case of simple thuggery &amp; criminality, does a great deal to turn our perception of things upside down. In this sense the film really is a departure from what we are familiar with. With the humanization of the Joker comes by implication something like a destabilization of the essential goodness of his opponents, if not Batman himself - who as yet doesn't quite exist - then of the plutocrat class Batman represents, which here is ingeniously symbolized by the somewhat ambivalent, but certainly not sympathetic figure of Bruce Wayne's old man.<br/><br/>In many ways this sets up potential for good things to come. We already know Bruce Wayne's anger and now we have discovered the source of the Joker's too. Whether Phoenix's Joker will ever meet an adult batman remains to be seen. It probably won't happen, but it would certainly be something to behold "
2201," Don't bother judging this movie based off critics it's a MUST WATCH
", This movie has created a brand new take on an often reworked character and it does it almost FLAWLESSLY. It managed to make you sympathize and understand the sheer madness that lies at the Joker's foundation. This movie is two hours of pure emotion and you will leave the theater a different person. Please don't believe ANYTHING the critical reviews say such as relating to this movies graphic nature or dark themes. Because honestly if you're an adult and you're seriously too sensitive to handle these elements then save the bad reviews because you're only detouring others who might understand and enjoy the film. 
2202," Best of DC from recent times.
"," Absolutely brilliant performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Everything was just perfect. Perfect portrayal of a lunatic supervillain. In a world where we hail the heroes, this movie has given us the chance to see the darker side of an Anti Hero. It also gives a vivid description of the inequal social structure in the present time. If this movie does not win the Oscar then the award itself will lose its value. "

2209," Jaw-dropping satire of society
", I went into the movie thinking it would be a typical superhero vs. Bad guy scenario. (PS: didn't even saw the trailer). Instead what I got was a astoundingly real and pure enactment of the things going on with society. There is no truer words spoken when the Joker commented on how we are programmed to classify what is right and wrong or what is funny and not funny. Sometimes we should question our decisions to whether our response is due to the years of programming done by societal norms or is it out of our own intention.<br/><br/>Must watch!!! 
2210," Surprisingly Excellent...HONESTLY
",
2211," Probably the best comic book movie of all time.
"," The character development shown is so good, you actually feel for Arthur (Joker). Phoenix has done a terrific job at portraying a mentally ill Arthur on his descent to madness. Todd Phillips has done a truly remarkable job at storywriting (with Scott Silver) and directing. A must watch. Joaquin's acting is undoubtedly Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>Also, big big credits to the background musician. Perfectly complements every scene in the movie. "
2212," A very straightforward movie ...
"," Showing the quirks of the human nature (certainly not talking about Joker here). When we see someone different, someone vulnerable, someone we can bully easily as humans we tend to jump on the opportunity of letting them know very well that they're misfits, they don't belong with us, they make us uncomfortable. We push these already broken souls to a level of madness where they retaliate in the way they were treated their whole lives, the place they never wanted to venture to...
And when they become what we pushed them into becoming, we condemn them... what hypocrites WE are .... "
2213," Fulfilled all my expectations

"," No cgi just realistic life. Just saw it in the cinema on Sunday<br/><br/>They say there's no money to be made anymore with serious, gritty dramas.
They say that. But not this
But then they haven't seen Joker, the origin story of Batman's arch-enemy, co-written and directed by Todd Phillips
This is hidden masterpiece
Arthur Fleck is an oddball in a cruel, intolerant world that doesn't have time to care for vulnerable people.There is not a career adviser on the planet who would have pushed him in that direction.
He's a chap who wants to put a smile on people's faces, and so he becomes a clown-for-hire during the day and an amateur stand-up comic at night<br/><br/>He lives in a Gotham City that's gone to the dogs:no sun uncollected garbage bags pile up like stinking black skyscrapers, welfare budgets have been slashed, and mass civil unrest is one small trigger-point away In realism for flash point of seismic portions and with the keys to power and copycats on the lose
To cleanse and purge on the nervousness of greed of a power struggle in the core of society A lone voice to takes the mantle to imaginative spotlight of his mob as he rides the waves of an election of spiraling toxic fumes rising from the carnage in the streets to the subways he gives lawlessness a new name to the baying mob
This gives a mega boast in grittness creepiness the joker has connections issues falling between the cracks of austerity in Gotham his grubbness in his makeup as his art of choice giving his deception like Inspiring his vendetta for life life and he is failing at everything because he hasn't a talent that descends to madness as mother's stories bring vengeance her love and his for her in is a downside there run down building and many fantasies of his neighbours and with hatred for the elite. his laughing illness that is creppy uncontrolled leads to situations that causes his bleakness in human society that in ""to cleanse, purge in away spirals into unimaginable events
So when lives are taken it makes the city tense looking to a void for some cult to follow he becomes their clown Prince his cult action of arising from hellish torment
all over a character no human soul just feeding rich people's lies of being family and mistrust of and using his
His only pleasure comes from watching Murray Franklin's chat show, on to which he dreams of being invited one day. Robert De Niro plays the legendary TV host,
Phoenix plays Arthur's tragic descent in a way which seemingly encourages our empathy but makes sure he never really gets it: so on the package this is the health warning we know he's not a character to whom you'd dont want to get too close. He will give you smile of approval his death sentence
, who plays a role in setting Joker down the path that turns him into the sociopathic clown<br/><br/>Joachim grips the hellish torment of a tormented soul and gives a classic portrayal of angst his character dillusions delve deep into the void and this film is taxi driver
Instead you have Joaquin Phoenix uses his weird charisma giving Daniel Day-Lewis esque performance of such intensity and weirdness, it will either have the Academy clowning the prizes in for realism
There is a maniacal emptiness behind his eyes which is a bit creepy.
The sun never shines in this Gotham City.<br/><br/>Class war simmers while the media crank up the tension with inflammatory headlines and irresponsible TV shows that give airtime to the wrong people for the wrong reasons. The elite live in a pampered bubble without a care in the world, wilfully ignorant of the hardships other folk suffer. It might be set in the early 1980s, but it is clearly a parable about the here and now.
mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins. Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen. If you haven't got a phobia of clowns you will after this creepy but stunning movie of the year.<br/><br/>Joker is infamous classic one for the ages. 10/10 "
2240," A really important film at frightening times
"," Never was there a more pertinent film for a time when society is beginning to fragment and people are becoming disenfranchised from family, core human values and love. Joker is not a 'Batman' type movie of the super hero genre; no, its much more important than that. Joker is not make believe; it's real. It's happening all around us and all over the world. Yet what is happening simultaneously, are the incredible webs of lies and deceit that are spun to delude and keep the truth down.Joachim Phoenix delivers an incredible performance that is central to the film's success. Bet he won't win an Oscar though because the liberal elite will find this film a tad hard to swallow. Liberal feedback is that the film is too violent however the trailers before this film started were 'acceptable' violence of endless garbage gratuitous films for the brain dead. Joker is a symbol of all those people in the world who are not cared for, loved or cherished - firstly by their nearest and dearest and then by society itself. When these people begin to disintegrate, we walk straight past them; be they addicts, homeless, refugees, mentally ill and the suchlike. Social media has only ingrained humanity's ability to isolate and take advantage of people's weaknesses or to downright use people to make money and so the 'super elite' are born. The super elite are the version (rats are everywhere in Gotham) who prey on the filth all around them. As we see Joker begin his downward spiral in to severe mental illness we can only lament that this illness permeates every part of media and politics and drug companies and crime of modern society. Joker leaves one question unanswered - where do we got from here? "
2241," A masterpiece
", The sequence of events in the movie was amazing.. we lived every moment with Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) 
2242," Absolutely amazing!
", I don't usually leave reviews for films but I thought this film was incredible. I've never left a cinema theatre where I was unable to pin point my emotional state before. The film makes you generally question society and how you fit into the world we have all built.. Incredibly tense! 
2243," Awesome movie. Blew me away!
"," You've heard the hype and seen the rave reviews. Believe it. Joker is the best movie of the year. Probably the best movie of the decade. Far exceeded my expectations. Director Todd Philips nailed it. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of his career. He is creepy and chilling and absolutely phenomenal as the Joker. The Academy should just hand him the Oscar right now. He definitely deserves to win best actor. And the movie should be nominated for best picture and it should win. There is controversy for good reason. It is violent, but I've seen more violent films than this. Hell. The new Rambo is far more violent. The character development that Joaquin portrays is unlike anything I have ever seen. As good a performance if dare I not say better than Heath Ledger's Oscar winning performance. I saw the advanced first showing on October 3rd at the cinema. Could not wait to see it. I'm going to see it again October 8th. Can't wait! This is a Must See in the theatre. The movie event of the decade. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? Go see it!! "
2244," Wow
"," Amazing movie everything was perfect sound track, acting, story line ect....<br/><br/>Myself being a huge fan of the Batman/Joker character this really hit me, the joker in this movie just reminds me on how the Joker should be from the comics.<br/><br/>I think a lot of people won't like it (young viewer) as everyone is too sensitive and peoole will be affected by the story line but please remember this is old school no special affects just great movie director and an amazing actor!

2246," AMAZING.
"," UGH, my heart will always hold a special place for Heath Ledger as Joker but this is next level good. It shows a completely different perspective of the Joker than any other movie has ever done. It captures how mentally unstable he really is and what made him become ""The Joker"" which was the coolest part. There is a reason why it's rated R though, very dark and some scenes left feeling me feeling uneasy. "

2252," Tada it's joker time
"," First of all when there were news going on that a movie is going to be made for joker I didn't wanted that to happen coz i felt nobody could replace what heath had did! But after watching trailer, posters and finally the movie I was amazed and felt that even heath wouldn't have pulled of this prequel joker role better than Joaquin ‚ù§. This man deserves an oscar for his acting. The story is simple and almost in all the scenes we will have to face joker alone but I never felt it was boring coz of this man's acting.The movie makes you really really uncomfortable and that's exactly what this movie needs it's audience to feel. I felt like someone is pushing something down my throat . And the movie also had very less or in fact no cg works and was so realistic that I got connected to it very very easily. The movie very barely had any jokes though joker laughs most of the time in the movie . Robert de Niro also did his role to perfect. The movie had a very great screenplay and great bgm which kept me engaged throughout. Atlast after coming out felt happy for watching such a film and at the same felt bad for on what It dealt with.
P. S. This movie has some scenes of Batman‚úåand completes the cycle too "
2253," If Joaquin doesn't get the Oscar, I'm suing
",
2254," Rarely do I review a movie, but
"," Wowsers! Believe the hype, it is that good! Weak Batman undercurrent for those who dismiss comic book themed movies this one tells you more about society than one of the best on screen villains of all time.<br/><br/>For a two hour movie to flyby leaving you wanting more, it has my vote. "
2255," Joker-best DC movie since The Dark Knight
"," Since I've heard about the rumors about a Joker origin movie being made up to the point where I've heard that Todd Phillips film Joker has won The Golden Lion Award at TIFF and in doing so it has become the first comic book/superhero movie that won the big award at TIFF,I knew that,as a huge fan of the character, I had to see Joker in theater.
By the way Joaquin Phoenix portrayal of The Joker is beyond breathtaking and this film wouldn't have won The Golden Lion at TIFF and it wouldn't have been received by both critics and fans of the characters as a masterpiece/amazing movie.
For me,Heath Ledger will be my favorite live action version of the comic book character but Phoenix really adds a big plus to the comic book character history and personality as well as making us feeling sorry for The Clown Prince of Crime and not to sympathize or to condone what Arthur Fleck/Joker does to people like Murray Franklin and Thomas Wayne but to understand why he does it and unlike Arthur/Joker,both of them don't give a damn about the people like him ,the people who are poor and have serious medical problems.
I really loved all the scenes from Todd Phillips movie and if I would have to pick 4 favorite scenes from the movie than those would be:the subway scene where Arthur Fleck kills those 3 guys who worked for Thomas Wayne because they bullied Arthur,the stairway dance scene,the hole talk show scene where Arthur kills Murray and the final scene where Arthur is in Arkham Asylum and starts laughing and after a few seconds we see a flashback with the youg Bruce Wayne being alone in a dark alley and in front of him are his parents who are dead and after that a woman who is in there with Arthur and it's his psychologist ask Arthur to tell her the joke that Arthur laughed and Arthur says "" You wouldn't understant it"".
That final scene is verry similar to the end from Alan Moore comic book Batman The Killing Joke where Joker starts telling Batman a joke that only the two of them would understant it.
I really loved Joaquin Phoenix in this movie and he should really win The Best Actor Award at the Oscar Ceremony.
The same thing goes for Todd Phillips as well,he should win at least one of these 3 Oscar Awards(Best Picture,Best Director,Best Original Screenplay) and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir should win the Oscar for Best Original Score because without her,both Joker and Chernobyl wouldn't have been complete.
Honestly,I don't know if Joker will have a sequel or not,Todd Phillips has said that this movie is a standalone DC film and that right now he doesn't have in mind a sequel for the film but if Joaquin Phoenix would want to do a sequel with him and if Warner Bros will ask him if he can do a sequel,than he might do it.
I personally prefer for Joker to not have a sequel because it might ruin the well received love/praise for this film.
Overall,Todd Phillips movie Joker is not just a great character study film but it is the 2nd if not the best DC movie ever and none of this would have been possible without Joaquin Phoenix performance as The Joker. "

"
2260," Joker is lifting the Rug and Looking Underneath
"," Joker is a character study, it is how a society can create a villain and later ridicule them for turning into one.<br/><br/>It starts with long shots of the protagonist laughing uncontrollably while his shrink watches on with an insensitive gaze. His constant restless legs and his laugh invoked by a medical condition along with his attempts to control it delivers an allegory to his hard attempts to not give in to the madness that is building up inside him. The idea of how death could bring more meaning than life scribbled in his book also gives another glimpse of how tired is he fighting every day with the piling up dirt. As much as the protagonist tries to do good, his actions are discouraged consistently: whether its the occupational stress and politics, public in general on the sidewalk or the bus.<br/><br/>
His lonely walks across the neighborhood especially the long stretch of stairs that he goes up towards his building shows the efforts he puts to stay the good man his mamma always wanted.<br/><br/>He becomes the sponge to the society's bullying crowd, until the scene where in his utter desperation of losing the job under an unfair situation he shoots few folks in the train. This does confuse and petrify him when he is out in the station but as he closes the door and comes in touch with his inner self, his feet naturally begin to move to match the tune of evil calling out to him for so long. And comes a dance, the dance of liberation, the dance of feeling himself, so truly.<br/><br/>The madness inside, keeps reaching out to the surface as the shrink prescribed pills are stopped as well. His delusions start going out of control. The more he kills, the better he feels and when he finally lets himself fall into the madness, we can see him going down the stairs wearing the suit all decked up for a talk show with a rejuvenated confidence and energy.<br/><br/>
Towards the final scenes, Joker licks his own blood and draws a smile on his face, seemingly enjoying the taste of his blood and also being acknowledged newly hailed king of anarchy. Or did he? The film is viewed through the unreliable eyes of Joker, who may have imagined the entire resurrection while being in Arkham Asylum, but it is all left open to the audience to interpret and let the imaginations run wild.<br/><br/>The film is a metamorphosis of the character from the crouched-bound by the world of unfairness and appearances to the man who lets his monster free, a monster that was born and grew on the backfires of the society.<br/><br/>The film carries a daunting background score created mostly on a cello and other string based instruments. Understandably, music is directed by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir (Chernobyl) who herself is a cello player. It is a refreshing shift from the arresting music of Hans Zimmer we are accustomed to in the The Dark Knight universe.<br/><br/>The scenes are artistic and well shot. There are many scenes with flickering lights, symbolizing the disturbance in the psyche of the protagonist. Gotham is presented as a city where the rich-poor gap is widening, there is an underground revolution in the making with chaotic graffiti all over the subway and city walls. The frustrated poor and the underprivileged exploited by the rich, protests and search for a face and a leader for their movement. With garbage lying scattered, the disorganization of the city is very visible.<br/><br/>Joaquin has been flawless and brilliant in his portrayal of Joker. The fluid dance, his wide-stepped run or the trademark laugh, all stay with you long after the film is over.<br/><br/>Joker is not just a comic film made to entertain, it is a thesis on the society how the lack of a simple virtue of sympathy can spiral anybody out of control. It's everyone's story who have wanted to scream and let their monsters out. It is very easily my favorite of the year and would likely stay so when the year ends. As our very own Thanos (Josh Brolin) puts it, ""Joker is simply lifting the rug and looking underneath it. Nothing more, Nothing less."" "
2261," Oscar worthy
", Joaquin Phoenix's performance was par excellence in the movie. He owned the screen for all of 2 hours and 2 minutes. Simply quintessential. In my head I have already given him an Oscar for the movie. 
2262," I would have give more than 10.
"," What are you going here, if you haven't watch the movie yet. First watch the movie then give your views, because this movie is only made to watch in theatres. This is the far most the Best movie of 2019 or you can say the entire comic movie industry. Joaquin Phoenix is all we want as a joker in every DC movie. Todd Philips has a great vision to create and know how a anti hero movie can also be so great. This is not just a anti hero movie it's the movie where we need to more educated. Hats off and. respect. "
2263," Funny in a sad way
"," This movie brought all the darkness and the sadness from the Joker's head to the screen. The movie is perfectly picturing the life from the Joker's psychological situation. It wasn't sad in a funny way, it was funny in a sad way.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best ever. "
2264," A ridiculously uncomfortable film bound to become a modern classic
"," Joker is bold, bizarre, and extremely uncomfortable to watch. Depicting madness and misery of this grandeur is no easy task, and though audiences are split, I found it mesmerizing. I've seen the film two times in the cinema now, and it left me feeling both uneasy and amazed both times. A rare piece of cinema, in other words. Also, big thumbs up for Phoenix being a certified legend, an Oscar is gonna come his way, I'm sure.<br/><br/>10/10 - Joker is absolutely nuts, go see it "
2265," A second look by a believer
"," My second Joker review.
With 2,946 user reviews already published within days of the release of Joker, almost all 10 star raves calling it a Masterpiece, best film ever made, a great comic book film, and highly influenced by Scorcese, I feel compelled to respond to this avalanche of hyperbolic enthusiasm with a followup to my own earlier review. That relatively sober review was one of the first published immediately after the world premiere of Joker in Venice a little over a month ago. And I was duly impressed.
As stated then I cannot disagree with any of the raves about Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance and will be amazed if he does not walk off with the Best Actor Oscar in February. However, while the last section of Joker is brilliant and masterfully directed, the picture as a whole, powerful as it is, is no masterpiece. It drags in places and could be tightened up here and there for better effect. These potholes are smoothed over by Phoenix's hypnotic performance as he is in just about every single scene and constantly rivets attention. It is his picture all the way, while director Todd Phillips seems to be along just for the ride. One of the best movies of this year, definitely, but ""of all time""? -- Come on, give us a break.
Calling this a ""Comic book film"" or a ""superhero film"" is utterly ridiculous.
It is a solid straightforward psychological character study only obliquely connected with the comic book Batman. As for connection with Scorcese's Taxi Driver, again ridiculous. Arthur Fleck has much more in common with Norman Bates of Psycho (including a problematic mother) than with Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver. In any case it is pointless to attempt to derive this unique stand alone study from similar sources. All films have some similarities to other films and this one is what it is. Period.
In an interview Joaquin Phoenix mentioned that he modeled his fantastic dance moves in Joker on Ray Bolger's Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Does that mean these films are connected? -- Joker and Wizard of Oz! Well, why not?
Phoenix deserves every award in sight and the movie itself will be a strong contender for Best film of the year. But super masterpiece it is not. At least, not quite. And it may even be aced out at the finish line in Hollywood.by the likes of Q. Tarantino's ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"".
I am, however, pleased to see that so many viewers respond to this film so positively in spite of all kinds of negative hullabaloo by slithery moralists around the edges. Fellini would have loved it.

2266," Well crafted and intense comic book origin story...
",
2267," we live in a society
"," No this does not tie in with previous DC films. No it does not follow any previous joker origins. It is what you've probably already read, a thorough, gritty and harsh character study on an ill outcast of society. It is superbly paced and felt so real to watch and the message behind it is clear, the director and Pheonix delivered what they intended and it isnt pretty. So people need to stop getting mad over the fact theres no cgi fight scenes and the fact it gives us such a deep dive into a persons mind, however messed up, and actually appreciate what theyve done with the character and that they managed to pull off such a meaningful film. 10/10 or ur as delusional as Joker "
2268," Phoenix is immortalized
"," The main reason and the main issue of the film is really simple, when you push a man too far by every his surrounding, Phoenix made a huge improvement to the role and he dealt with mental illness very professionally, and that's something it was really well done, although the final act of the movie was truly breathtaking, for me Phoenix gave a performance of a life time and he souls really get the recognition that he deserves "
2269," Se acab√≥ la espera!!!
", Se acab√≥ la espera!!! A real master piece of cinematography. Joaquin Phoenix will be nominated for the academy awards. 
2270," Twisted and Dark
", Great character development. Kinda twisted and dark but worth the hype. A must see. 
2271," Fantastic
", I absolutely loved it. Perfect blend of violencenand action. Manages never to go over the top and actually makes you feel sorry for Arthur at certain points. That is of course until later on in the movie you're reminded about who he really is and you end up absolutely hating him. Definitely a film worth checking out and will be getting on Blu-ray the day it releases 
2272," Awesome!
", Joaquin Phoenix portrays the Joker excellently. The tone of the movie is fantastic and follows the character well. 10/10 
2273," Uncomfortably Breathtaking
", One of those movies where it's you find yourself uncomfortable while watching but completely captivated by it at the same time. I'm a huge DC fan but this transcends superhero flicks and delivers something far beyond that of a comic book adaptation. See this movie!!! 
2274," Excellently lays the foundation of the Joker, the person
"," This movie is truly one of a kind. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of portraying the complexity of the Joker's inner struggle of understanding who he is while he is simultaneously gaining a clearer understanding of where he fits in society. You can't help but feel empathy as you learn of the Joker's past, even if you completely sided with Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight. This will be one to see more than once to really capture all of the subtle nuances that make this movie great. "
2275," Uncomfortable and edgy
"," First, not for kids! This movie was very rare and dark. It touches you in ways that feel real. With what's going on in the world with real people with real problems, it brings that awareness of people that do have mental diseases. It's unnerving and uncomfortable at times. But that is true acting and story telling. I felt chills, I felt my heart drop at certain points of the movie. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying and it's not a horror movie. Performance worth of at least an Oscar nomination. So glad the emphasis was solely on the Joker and not so much Batman or Bruce Wayne at that. Well done! "
2276," Amazingly Dark
", Phoenix definitely deserves an award for this one. Incredible performance. 
2277," Brilliant!
", Best movie I have seen in a very long time- Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal- 
2278," The Joker who doesn't know any jokes!
"," Finally, DC got back into the right track. After so many big budget failures, and simultaneously being knocked down by many Marvels Studios' masterpieces, Shazam! was a spark of hope . but now Joker is a proof that DC is back as strong as the time which was ended by Dark Knight. Joker shows that story is first, acting is second and then is special effects. Todd Philips presented his talent in writing and directing. Joaquin Phoenix portrays another joker, which is the same level as jack Nicolson's and Heath ledger's. when movies was ended I visualized Todd and Joaquin with Oscars in their hands. "
2279," Magnificent
", It's ridiculous that critics would base a rating on a political message because in reality this is one of the most well acted movies I've ever seen and Phoenix gives Ledger a run for his money. If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this it's because America couldn't handle it. 
2280," A stunning masterpiece.
"," There is no flaw in this film. From start to finish it is exceptional. Ths soundtrack is perfect. The darkest comedy I've ever seen and the mix of the two is balanced perfectly. When the final credits ended, I was left completely satisfied and knew what I had just watched was a masterpiece and easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen. I will be watching this film over and over again for the rest of my life. "
2281," This is not a BATMAN movie
"," If you are going to watch it thinking that it will be an action movie
Well it is not
This movie is so deep
And that explains why a lot of people didn't get it
You can do some readings before watch it
Read about Anarchism
And is good and bad are objective or subjective
And culture and counterculture
Also I recommend a book

So yah you really need to know stuff to get it "
2282," Awesome üòä

2283," Awesome
"," One of the best movies of recent times, a movie which should not be left without a statuette for both its magnificent protagonist and for an impeccable direction of Todd Phillips. That ambiguous atmosphere was maintained throughout the movie due to having the point of view of the prince of crime. Masterpiece. "
2284," A dark and sad story regardless of hereos, antiheroes or villains
"," It's more like a drama that depicts evil bureaucracy in our society. Seems a little overhyped, but it's a good movie. It shows are different and how bad the lives of certain people are, and that we're to self-obsessed to take notice or/and care. Story of a man with a tragic life really. That's what this movie is in a nutshell. You don't need to think of so much more than that. "

"," Indeed a superclasss acting, definitely winning an Oscar for such a spectacular performance. The stort line is outstanding, the idea that rich folks can not understand is that the poor do not always want their foundation money, they only want dignity and to be recognized as respected human being, in my humble opinion the message was very well delivered in this movie. I stood and applauded after the movie ended, once again utterly brilliant acting. "
2287," ""Can you introduce me as Joker?""
"," Joaquin Phoenix absolutely nailed it. Excellent acting, directing, and an amazing atmosphere in this movie. My only complaint is I wish we could have seen more of his time as the Joker once he's introduced on television. I would of liked to have seen more schemes or something else after his transformation. Regardless the final act of this film is haunting and magnificent.<br/><br/>I'll give this a 9.1/10. "

"," I have been telling this my whole life. Mental abuse and mental injuries are far worse than physical. Even the smallest ones! They almost never heal.<br/><br/>I don't understand why so many people still ignore power of the mind, soul, however you want to call it.<br/><br/>Great job every single person involved in this creation! Great F... job! "
2290," No review needed. This movie is complete.
", What the title says. Go watch the movie now! It's truly phenomenal without a doubt. 
2291," Absolute Masterpiece.
", One of the few movies that comes around that you will remember forever. An absolute masterclass. Phoenix has brought to life some brilliant characters and I've been a fan but the way he built and portrayed this character is on another level. Daniel Day Lewis is one of the all time great method actors and deserved triple Oscar winner but Phoenix for me takes this crown. Two of the best hours ever. If he does not get an Oscar for this film (and Todd Phillips for Directing) - how can the Oscars ever be considered credible. 
2292," Art in the Comedy.
"," You can feel how Arthur little by little, without medication and with it he gives in to madness and comes to embrace her after so much suffering. A renegade, a nobody, who is mistreated by a battered society. It has this thin thread of comedy and what it is not and what it means for society, and she has that laugh that sees her as an evil, but it is her salvation from how miserable life is in Gotham or what she can be now Although maybe it's an inciting movie, it's not an awkward movie, it's not a twisted story, it's a voice, it's necessary (in many ways), it makes you feel ... it's art and it's brutal. "
2293," Don't expect like The Dark Knight.
"," Not everyone can catch its deeper meaning. It's not for everyone. Please, don't expect like The Dark Knight. That movie was all about what Joker can do, and this one is all about how he became Joker. I loved the movie and still can not understand why some people hate it. Just ignore them, it's worth watching. I wouldn't be surprised if Joaquin Phoenix gets nominated for Best Performance by an Actor (in a Leading Role) and win it as well. He deserves it. "
2294," the most unique comic book movie ever
",
2295," An instant classic. A triumph for all involved.
"," Brilliant, provocative, deeply disturbing and truly an amazing piece of cinema. A stunning directorial work and a showcase for the inestimable talent of Phoenix. It is a must-see event for adult audiences. Bravo. "
2296," Flawless
"," Simply flawless. Give me more joker! Would watch again. Yes, it is slow. Nothing really happens into the very end but it was all worth it for the climax. Great acting. Great story. Came out the screening feeling very happy "
2297," Movie of the year
", The movie was a great and ithink this movie will go to a many win and the hero as joker he shoud to win the oscar 
2298," A Masterpiece which would have worked as great even if it had not relation with the BATMAN Universe
"," JOKER is a psychological study of the character, Not your regular comic book Movie. The movie forces audience to think deeply about issues regarding morality, mental health, bullying, the rich and the society as a whole. The main focus of the movie is the mind of Arthur and how it fragments apart under the many inhumane but impactful acts of the society which when pile up brings out the Joker in Arthur. What makes this hit the core of masses, is its relatability. He's a relatable kind of villain, bullied and sad. It also depicts how mental health issues are ignored by the corporates and the suffering people become even more isolated. Joaquin Phoenix has done a phenomenal job, even just looking at his laugh in which he has masterfully depicted the hidden sorrow behind the character, makes you realize that the man has worked hours and hours just to make this perfect. Cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack suited the storyline perfectly. Even if the movie had no relation to the Batman universe at all, it would still have worked just as great. In the end, although you can't justify the acts of Arthur, but you definitely understand them. "
2299," GREAT JOB
", Joaquin Phoenix act and Todd Phillips combo make suxh a great film its make you feel like there are many jokers out there and its make you feel sad for nice people treated so badly oit there 
2300," heath cant be replaced
"," First thing come to our mind while hearing joker is heath from DK.
But this one may slightly change your priority.
Its difficult to see a new actors as joker.
But this one is totally next level. "
2301," Outstanding
", This movie was emotionally gripping and Phoenix's portrayal of joker was nothing short of outstanding. 
2302," Joaquin had me believe he was the real Joker!!
"," This film was phenomenal. Engaging through out the film, not a dull moment . Has you feeling empathetic for Arthur , aka Joker, from beginning to end. It was a tad bit dark but I like how it shows the story of how he came to be. How mental illness is a big impact on your life. Joaquin truly did an exceptional job!! "
2303," Masterful performance!
"," Unpopular opinion, but I think Phoenix leap frogged Ledger. This was his best performance. I'm scared the role took a toll on him mentally due to how excellently he portrayed joker. Great plot, great choice of actors and incredible sound track. "
2304," I respect Ledger for Joker role, but Joaquin is better!!
"," Ledger give a high standard for DC's most maniac villain, respect for him..but sorry now Joaquin give more!! His deep 'tragedy laugh' make more iconic scene in the one of best movie of this year!! PERFECT CAST AND DESERVE AN OSCAR FOR PHOENIX!! AWESOME MOVIE!! 9/10. "
2305," Movie of the year!
", Worth every penny and I would recommend this movie to every DC fan. Joaquin Phoenix lead us on a journey of an innocent man turning in to the Villain Batman truly deserves. Great Acting. Should definitely be nominated for Oscars and also win it 
2306," deeply moving
",
2307," The best of Joaquin Phoenix!
", The movie turned out to be as great as expected. Mind blowing acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Oscar deserving acting. 
2308," Epic, Great actor
"," I was impressed when he, laughing in the same time you can see how he want to cry In the same time you see how he want to revenge from all, he must win oscar for this filme ,great filme thanks "
2309," Believe the hype, disregard bad reviews
"," The controversy surrounding this film definitely lured me into the theater last night to watch it. I have to say it is a dark and gritty movie. I can understand the fears of this film inciting violence but that is not a reason to not see it. Joaquin Phoenix is Oscar worthy for his performance and I am totally blown away by this movie. I live outside of Annapolis, MD where a mass shooting took place not even 2 years ago and this movie is relevant to our social climate now more than ever. I think NOT seeing this movie is doing more damage than seeing it. It may be just my opinion but I do expect to see an Oscar nod or two. "
2310," not all villains are evil..
"," I loved it so far this is my favorite movie this year, Joaquin must win the Oscar for best actor he was born to do it .. The sequence of events was perfectly done, the direction.. Great job congratulations to Joaquin Phoenix "
2311," Great movie
", You should watch this movie it's one of my favorite movies now 
2312," Amazing movie
", This film captures what it can be lack for some people to live in the shadow of society and how that can make them feel. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant definitely Oscar worthy. It borrows heavily from the king of comedy and taxi driver but applies it well to a comic book villains origin story 
2313," Worth all the hype
"," Joaquin absolutely nailed this performance, this is the best acting I've seen in a while (if he doesn't get an Oscar I don't know who will). The movie has a very simple premise, but is executed very well. Every scene looks like a painting and there are not many lines, but every one of them is powerful. Go watch it if you haven't! "
2314," Brilliant
", This is the best movie this year and possibly for the whole decade 
2315," The film of the year
"," For cinema holics who wanna a 70s drama and Scorsese's films , it perfect "
2316," The reflection of the society
"," The society created the joker; the joker created batman.<br/><br/>If you are in Hong Kong, you will find this movie even more inspiring! Joker is the reflection of this hypocrite cold blooded society. I like both Phoenix version and health version joker, and this one is more realistic. What makes a person anti-social? To become sociopath? It's the society itself. "
2317," One of The Best Movie of The Year
"," Joker is one the best movie of the year, and the best R rated fictional movie after Logan. I just watched it last night and it lived up to my expectations. I didn't disappointed or dissatisfied at all. Many critics said that this movie is so dark, bloody, violent, disturbing, inappropriate, and teasing the reality of the world we living in. But besides all that, it's just a fictional movie, and duh... It's an R rated, what did you expect. Todd Phillips has truly done a great job. Joker is the best R rated movie of the year, period. "
2318," One of the best movies I've seen
"," This movie focuses on mental health issues, and how it can affect someone in a very negative way, which is why it's so great. It's realistic, not over the top, and it's something that we should all reflect on. On how we treat our peers. I've always been a fan of superhero/villain movies, but this will remain to be one of the best I've ever seen. "
2319," An experience that i will never forget
", In short just give it every award that ever existed 
2320," Brilliant
", The supervillain of the batman the Joker there is some nice connection to the batman I absolutely enjoyed the movie and acting this actor phoenix that was the amazing part of the movie I have seen his movie first and I am his fan now brilliant performance. 
2321," The Greatest Joker!
", Incredible movie which had everything. Phoenix was perfect. 
2322," Very dark feel, the Laugh of Joker means Pain
", We can easily understand how Pure Evil are born.<br/><br/>Well planned &amp; well played movie. 
2323," A Great Take on Joker
"," The movie Joker is by far a resounding success and for good reason. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece of any sorts like most fans are, but it's such a well done film overall and it works really well. I loved every aspect of this story and how it led to Arthur becoming the Joker. Again, wouldn't say it's the masterpiece everyone else is claiming it to be, but it is certainly an amazing film to watch. "
2324," perfect villain for batman
"," Perfect villain for batman, love this movie, great acting, great story "
2325," Wow. Just wow.
"," I am beyond words. This movie is phenomenal. It is a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix definitely is my favorite live action Joker. Yes more than Heath and Jack (although i really HATE comparing them). This is not your typical comic book movie. It is a character study about a man who becomes the Joker. About what it took to drive him this far. The film is dark, disturbing and masterful work of art. Its one of the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. This movie deserves an Oscar. Not just beat actor, but best score, best cinema photography, best film and of course, best director, which definitely goes to the man Todd Philips. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get an oscar i'll riot. Believe the hype and screw the haters. Its truly beautiful. But dont just take my word for it, take all of the other 100's of positive reviews that say the same thing. I seriously wish there was a higher number than 10. This is like a 101/10. Just check it out. You won't regret it. Don't forget to smile and put on a happy face. "
2326," Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is Rebellious,Transcendental Psychotherapeutic-Art in film-format.
",
2327," More beyond than we thought
", It's a masterpiece! The director Todd Philips was right about saying that Marvel cannot make a movie like this. He reminded us what cinema is. I still couldn't find any negative things about this. 
2328," Finally someone's on par with Heath Ledger
"," Heath Ledger's Joker was total chaos. Very smart, spontaneous and stupendously brave.
But Joaquin Phoenix's joker is a man oppressed by the heartless, careless society and broken financial system. He's born in poverty that has deprived him of his social rights.
Joaquin Phoenix has out done himself and justified the extremely high acting bar set by Heath Ledger.
Finally someone's on par with Heath Ledger and his Joker. "
2329," ALREADY SAW IT TWICE
"," Even without Batman knowledge this movie is 9/10 easily. With the Easter egg knowledge it's an all timer. You root for Joker, you're terrified of Joker, and then you love him again. Joaquin's personality changes minute to minute, consequently there doesn't even need to be another character in the movie because he gives you so many with his various takes on the greatest villain ever. When you leave the theater the character follows you home. "
2330," a great movie for a super villain.
"," Let's not forget who mr. j is, he is first and foremost a super villain. And super villains need to have an awesome backstory. This is exactly what the movie aced.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't CGI itself to death (ahem marvel), that's to say this is a very grounded film, and if not for the title and subject matter this could stand as a great drama/thriller. "
2331," ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT
"," I don't want to overhype and ruin it for others, but this is honestly the best acting performance I've ever seen. It's not action packed like other movies about Batman or Joker, but it's still disturbing, terrifying, anxiety provoking and depressing. And that is all because Joaquin Phoenix GETS IT DONE! Go see this movie! "
2332," Oscar winning performance !!!
"," The most disturbing and brilliant acting I have ever seen. Oscar winning performance!!! FYI This film is NOT light hearted or funny it cuts deep, it's disturbing and completely different- Instead of a DC action, witty, charming villain, he's ordinary with serious mental health issues. "
2333," My favorite movie this year!
"," I wont spoil it. I will say its dark and dramatic. You see a new side of him. In some ways youll kinda sympathize with the joker. IMO Phoenix makes the best version of all time. However, everyone has there on preference. So it depends on you. "
2334," Mindblowing
"," What a movie...think Batman style from a villain point of view? Epic battles and super style fighting? Think again...(or be disappointed)
A dark movie about a guy with mental problems slowly loosing it and starting to become the iconic villain. Not planned or on purpose, just by being him, society and insanity.
The acting is great, not only by the main actors, but also the supporting characters. Filmed in a style representing the era on every point taken.
The movie starts slow, it took some time to get on speed. But when it does, it sucks you right in....
Intense acting, some dark comedy relief and raw violence. Nice plot turns and build up. Surprises all along.. "
2335," An incredible commentary on today's world
"," Joker directed by Todd Phillips gives a great new rendition of the character showing us his downward spiral into iconic supervillain we all know. Jaoquin phoenix brilliantly stars as Arthur fleck a man who from the outset of the film in the opening scene we can see is a man haunted by mental illness and as the movie develop we see him continually pushed to the brink of insanity leading to his eventual transformation into the joker figure. This raw and incredibly realistic view of mental health is at the core of the film and allows for some great social commentary on the state of mental health care system today aswell as the role this has to play in the violence of todays world that is becoming ever more present .<br/><br/>The film upon its release has been steeped in controversy for fears that it will incite violence and way I think this can be perceived is because the movie doesn't tell us how to feel about the violence it portrays in such a real and gritty fashion. This film has no batman , the batman and joker dynamic has always been fascinating each present a warped reflection of the other - polar opposite yet starkingly similar in that they are two men unable to escape the tragedy of their past, but without the batman and the yin yang moral compass that both characters embody the film doesn't tell us how we should feel when Arthur who originally acting out of self defence is justified but as he becomes increasingly deranged and increasingly violent it opens up a great debate about how society views and alienates those suffering with mental illnesses. While the actions of fleck towards the climax of the film become continually twisted and sadistic as he fully embodes the choas that defines the joker character the key take away of the joker should not be that it is a dangerous movie but one that while dark and incredibly disturbing at times is a necessary film that perfectly mirrors our own world in terms of the lack of access to medication, unemployment and the themes of depression and humiliation throughout that constantly keep it rooted in reality. It's the perception of mental illness in the film and its reflection on today's world that really make it a cautionary tale to all of us that we should treat those around us as we all wish to be treated ourselves with greater understanding, compassion and sympathy. "
2336," Masterpiece!!!!!
", Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic in this film!! Oscar worthy!!! 
2337," This is Joker
"," Outstanding, phenomenal, just perfect.
I have waited for a Joker movie for years. And this did not disappoint. Todd Phillips did incredible with the movie but Joaquin Phoenix is the true star. His acting is out of this world and mesmerized me in every scene. The story telling is beautiful and maintained your attention from beginning to end. This is my favorite movie of 2019. I am honestly highly satisfied at the portrayal of Joker, the acting, and the movie itself. Phenomenal. "
2338," Amazing performance but light on depth and substance
"," Amazing and thought provoking movie with a remarkable performance from Joaquin Phoenix, I was completely transfixed at certain points.
The absolute tragedy and spiral to the depths of despair of the main character were portrayed brilliantly leaving me overwhelmed with sadness and even empathy despite knowing I 'should' despise him.
The movie is beautifully shot, with a brilliant soundtrack - a real feast for the eyes and ears.
The De Niro casting was inspired, with many nods to Taxi Driver and King of Comedy.
The issues for me were around lack of development and depth of the supporting characters and plot from a fairly weak screenplay for the first hour or so.
It seemed the directors goal was often about setting up set pieces for Pheonix's (amazing) performance but that came at the expense of the overall breadth and depth of the narrative.
Definitely worth seeing, I left feeling astonished and impressed at what I had witnessed but ultimately slightly less than fulfilled. "
2339," Excellent
", Must see 10/10. One of the best films in a long time. 
2340," Send in the CLOWNS!!!!
", Don't believe the hype it's not enough. Don't expect anything as this masterpiece breaks all your expectations! This is a movie which at times makes you sick and at times shows you glimpse of the world through the Joker's eyes! One of the best DC films and after 10 years Clown takes the Crown back and sits on the throne again!!<br/><br/>MUST WATCH FOR EVERY MOVIE LOVER! 
2341," Excellent Film
", This film pieces together everything you need to understand the joker and how he came to be. 
2342," Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!
", I can't stop thinking about this movie. What a great time!!! 
2343," The best thing I have ever seen in 2019
", I am speechless this film is incredible and joaquin Phoenix preformed so good I even still think about it until this moment what an actor l loved every thin in the film the soundtracks the great acting and directing well done 
2344," This movie is the best movie in 5 years
", Oh my God I can't imagine how beautiful of this week how perfect this movie is the best movie Ever. 
2345," Put on a happy face...
", Simply outstanding. The greatest peace of acting I've ever seen! 
2346," Already want to see it again!
", One of the best movies I have seen in years. I love that it is a grown up version of DC and not cartoonish like so many others have been. Fingers crossed that there is a sequel that stays true to this approach. 
2347," Sometimes i remember it one way, sometimes i remember it another.
"," The Joker has many origin stories, in comics, in movies or even series.
What this movie essentially does, is amplifies the best qualities that Joker offers.
It is a raw, sickening, intriguing and unsettling movie that understands what Joker is supposed to be, unpredictable, chaotic, the ebb which flows.<br/><br/>I have so many good things to say, and literally no negativity towards this movie.
Amazing visuals, spectacular actor who portrays Joker, good music, stylish and memorable scenes.<br/><br/>As a fan, this is everything i ever wanted. If this is your first Joker movie,
expect to be shocked, repulsed, disgusted, intrigued.
This is what Joker is, this is what joker has always been and should always be.<br/><br/>A solid 10/10, i can't believe we live in a world where movies from DC can be this good. "
2348," Big Holes That Society Has, And Are Covered
"," I can resiliently say that Joker is a movie the world needed. Most critics get carried away by political, personal and sometimes illicit influences as they review it. In this way it presents a disturbed view of masterful works. Joker touches delicate subjects in a way that is rarely seen in today's theaters. If the world can't handle a profound work like, then it means the world needs to change. And change the way we view complex social issues, which we prefer to isolate it from debate because of the high diversity of opinion. Very well built and set, Joker brings big holes that society has, and are covered. "
2349," Scintillating performance
"," Joaquin Phoenix has acted beautifully and mesmerising. How a sequence of bad events can make an already unstable person to full blown psychosis. The way Joaquin laughed, smiled, cried and even those intense glare he gave spoke so much emotion. It was truly magnificent seeing an actor showing the characters emotion through their eyes.
The state of how Arthur became The Joker is very well depicted.üî•üî•
This movie wasn't slow, it wasn't boring, it was building. From the opening scene to the very end.üî•üî•üëèüëè. Joker - For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.üòéüî•
Phoenix deserve a Oscar üëè "
2350," Speechless.. Stunned !!
"," My review is incomplete as there is so much to discuss but i am speechless.. This is by far one of the most ""well done"" movie based on the life of a mentally ill person. You are very much instilled in the shoe of a person who has mental illness and has to face the modern day society who expect him to behave.. as if he doesn't !! For me this move is 1 step beyond another master piece called ""Memento (2000)"" which was also based on a mentally ill character. But Joker is an extensively Dark movie for a main-stream Cinema specially when he is dancing he is sending a layered message to the audience. Most of the times this movie gives you the feel of an Art Movie (more than just an action flick or superhero flick). The dark and disturbing part of this movie is sheer work of Art that too performed with utter brilliance. And last but not least, Phoenix is by far the best and most Realistic Joker ever.. for me he did a PERFECT job of not only Joker but also a mentally ill person.. Perfect expression, laughter and dialogue delivery .. In the End Please NOTE: that when i said 'mentally ill' i meant a person Not Fit for modern day hypocrite Society : ) "
2351," One of the best
", One of the best movies I ever seen. Felt real cause a great storyline and actors 
2352," Let the revolution begin.
"," This film is a work of art. It revolutionises the way stories should be told. The message conveyed by the movie very strong, but doesn't apply in modern society. Its not a superhero movie. If you categorise it as a superhero movie its one of the best ever made. If you categorise it as a drama its one of the best ever made. It's one of the best in every genre including comedy. If you can't go to theatre, pirate it. That's what the joker wants. "
2353," Awesome performance & Direction
", Outstanding presently facts of joker about his lifecycle from good to bad transition! 
2354," -A dark masterpiece-
"," Don't go into this movie thinking that it's going to carry the same tone as the dark knight. This movie goes much further than that, and brings an even more realistic approach to the character and this world. The comic book ""feel"" is completely absent from the film and that, I think, is what makes this movie so unique. A cautionary tale telling society to GET. IT'S. ACT. TOGETHER. "
2355," ""Twisted and Terrific ""
"," Joaquin Phoenix has done the unthinkable, and has created a character within himself which is both terrifying and twisted. A truly amazing performance as the clown.<br/><br/>Take a bow, Joaquin "
2356," All I have are positive thougts
"," One more masterpiece for the DC movies. Joaquin Phoenix deserves for sure his oscar and Todd Philips did an amazing job not only as a director but also as a writer. I fully recommend this movie to all the fans of the dark knight and to those who love character development and interesting dialogues and quotes and generally movies that keep you thinking hard for weeks. So it is important to remember that this Joker is a different version of the character and so you should not hope for another 2008-Joker. Moreover, it is not a Nolan movie and so its main theme and focus are different from the Dark Knight since Joker is a drama-thriller movie. And this is the reason why it is such an unique film-masterpiece. Finally, it is one of the most interesting movies I have ever watched. "
2357," Amazingly Dark
", Best DC movie I've ever seen. Hopefully they stick to this R rated dark path 
2358," Superb.
"," Superb! Joaquin Phoenix's performance is Oscar-worthy. If you like comics and the trend of comic book movies, do not miss it and judge for yourself. "
2359," Dont rate many on here - but oscar!
", If Joaquin doesn't win an oscar for his performance then its a definite fix. Because he did an outstanding job. Managed to create a completely new and original character of joker even after so many versions. And he created quite possibly my favourite. 
2360," Very real and believeable
", Didn't feel like comic book adaption but like film about Arthur whose in deep trouble with his illness and diffiucult life and world around him. 
2361," Realistically dark and emotionally bold fantastic performance!
"," Just finished watching #Joker and got to say Joaquin Phoenix's acting was absolutely brilliant I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get an oscar! Film maybe slow for some it's not your typical comic book movie but the acting, the feeling and emotionally bold storytelling is realistic yet dark. üëå "
2362," And the Oscar goes to...
"," Great study of one twisted character. Best performance of great Joaquin.

2367," Masterpiece
"," Oscar deserving performance. Great story telling, great score, great screenplay, full of suspense and goosebumps. "
2368," one of the best dark thrillers of our time
"," The best performance i have ever seen by an actor,period..I really felt concerned that Phoenix really lost it and went insane..His expressions his laugh his reactions everything that he does makes you forget that he is acting and that he really suffers from some disease ..Despite this absolute oscar winning masterpiece of a performance though,there is also a very strong plot that builds slowly step by step helped by the really beautifully dark cinematography that makes it even more appealing .The second star of this film after Phoenix,for me at least, is the soundtrack..It bounds his creepy performance,its dark cinematography and its terrific plot in the most disturbing way,making the film so powerfully depressing that it gets to you..I leave the violence thing for the end,because many things have been heard and written.We're talking about Joker and DARK DC in an R-rated movie,what did they expect ? Flowers and sunshine ? There are movies out there that are even more violent but in the end,none of them is as violent as the real world that we live in. "

10 STARS "
2374," Is the Joker the misfit or the society?
"," This film shows the human side of the Joker, the mental illness, not being acepted by the society and being humiliated. He is raised with traditional values and has deep connections with his mother who inspired him to make people laugh as his life mission.
Is the Joker the misfit or the society we are living in has lost its ways, looking down to care of older people and focusing on seeing only the deviations from the standard way of behaving, standard way of talking and standard way of dressing and looking like.
In the beginning the Joker thought his life is a tragedy, in the end he understood it is a comedy. "

2380," Spectacular
"," Movie of the year! Actor of the year!
Thank you for the best Joker character portrayal I've ever seen. "
2381," A TRUE MASTERPIECE
"," That's it....brilliant film..acting off the scale..the taxi driver of our generation, Oscar worthy performance...menacingly beautiful. "
2382," Extremely clever humour
", If you like freakish humour you will love this film the great acting and well planned out scenes creates a sick but funny dark humour. 
2383," Heath Ledger RIP
"," I refused to watch Suicide Squad as I thought Heath Ledger had nailed the Joker. I'm back to square one now, it's going to take an amazing trailer for me to entertain watching another Joker movie. "
2384," Perhaps the most human villain I've ever seen
"," If watching this film was a game of chess, you'd be playing against an opponent who won the game before it even started. No matter how you defend your king, your opponent outmaneuvers you and penetrates your emotional defenses every step of the way. Other directors should take notes because this is character study drama at its finest.<br/><br/>While some will say it moved too slowly, I personally feel it was paced perfectly given the content; a slow-bleeding, 'death by a thousand cuts' delivery, which gradually ramps up over the course of the entire film. The juxtaposition of humor and despair had my emotions on a tilt-a-whirl throughout, and was accompanied by a soundtrack that complemented the themes very well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this one at least once, but steel yourself because it packs quite a punch. "
2385," An experience one must have!!
"," Let me just say that no, the praise everyone has heard about this before it released was not the usual overhyping of a movie from critics at festivals, it was 100% deserved, I completely understand why it got an 8 minute standing ovation at Venice and yes, I did clap when this movie ended, and so did the packed audience at the theatre I went to.
I mean, can you blame me? From the minute ""Joker"" starts you are glued to the screen, I literally did not avert my gaze for a second. Joaquin Phoenix gives probably the best performance of his life (and that's saying something) and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.
The story, even though a tad predictable, is amazingly written, full of great moments, both funny and dramatic and really shows
us why Arthur Fleck decides to turn into the homicidal maniac that is the Joker.
Overall this is probably my favourite comic-book of all time, if not just favourite movie of all time, the way Todd Philips directed his feature is astonishing, I mean this movie looks sooooo good and I, for one, cannot wait to see what he does in the future. "
2386," Powerful performance
", I was very skeptical about the film going in. But Phoenix won me over. It was a commanding performance and an up close look at mental health. Thank you Mr Phoenix for living up to Heath Ledgers legacy. 
2387," A great character arc but...
", The ending of the film feels sort of unfinished. I think the film should've ended when he stands on the police car and draws a smile to the crowd because that is the best shot of the entire film. The actual which was Joker being chased by the hospital staff was a bit toned down. 
2388," The Joker
"," Everything was on point. I was not surprised by Phoenix's performance, because he is always terrific. I was in love with the way cinematography was put there. You just can see scenes that are so unique and art that you'd want the movie to stop there. Joker is the best movie I have seen in 2019 so far and an Oscar worthy nominee. "
2389," Great movie
", Joaquin Phoenix undoubtedly gave us the best performance of the year. Beautiful cinematography and score. Not much else to be said. 
2390," Performance
"," It's outstanding performance from Joaquin,this movie make feel the pain it's just amazing performance and after all this year Joaquin will win Oscar "
2391," An outstanding movie
", This is probably the best joker adaptation we will ever get and Joaquin Phoenix does a terrific job of playing this character he knocks it's out of the park. 
2392," Best movie of Decade
"," Stunning acting by phoenix. He really is legend. Story, acting cast every thing is just perfect. will go and watch again and again. "
2393," Joker: A killing joke
"," 'Joker' is all about a man being pushed down all the way until he finally snaps. And mind you, by 'Snap' I do not mean - 'to give up'. When a man snaps, he is oblivious to all boundaries of morality and righteousness - which brings us to the very transition of Arthur Fleck to 'The Joker'. This movie describes why 'The Joker' was created in the first place. It is not a typical DC movie in which there is a certain motive that has to be fulfilled by the protagonist or the antagonist concerned and this is why I believe, it stands out. Overly critical viewers might be a tad disappointed regarding the plot of the movie because - simply put, this movie has no plot. It is definitely not an origin story since the director has taken a completely new take on the character. We don't see Arthur Fleck drowning in a tank of boiling chemicals only to emerge as a completely psychotic individual whose sole objective is to watch the world burn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rather we see a man being thrown into an utterly bullish society devoid of any empathy<br/><br/><br/><br/>The man is bullied to such an extent that he doesn't even consider his life to be a tragedy anymore. And as Arthur puts it plainly - ""All my life I didn't even know I existed, but now I do and people are starting to notice""<br/><br/>The moment he snaps he finally realises that his life was a comedy - a joke. A killing one. Not one, being killed.<br/><br/>'Joker' is a beautiful movie. Not because it attempts to discover a completely new aspect of the world's most iconic villain of all time but because it successfully justifies ""The Joker's"" perspective in front of the audience to the point at which the audience is compelled to cheer for everything the joker does. The movie brainwashes its audience who were already finicky about it.
A man being pushed down to such an extent that all he has to lose - is nothing<br/><br/><br/><br/>And boy has Joaquin Phoenix delivered an absolute masterpiece. He is a brilliant actor and has justified it over and over again with his movies. But, just like Heath Ledger, he was born to play 'The Joker' and I am glad his decision hasn't taken a toll on his mental health. ""The Joker"" is a character who thrives in pandemonium. He is a sergeant of mayhem and to do justice to his character is an improbable task for any actor. But Phoenix is not an ordinary actor. If you have seen, 'You Were Never Really Here' you would probably understand why Joaquin was cast as the Joker. He somehow understands what a 'broken man' means - primarily because he himself had struggled immensely for the vast majority of his life. He has carried Heath Ledger's legacy forward and we deserved it. We have waited for over a decade for it.
It would be criminally unjust to assert that Joaquin betters Heath as ""The Joker"" because both of them had different roles albeit the same character, but entirely separate storylines to follow. Heath Ledger's Joker was all about watching the world burn but Nolan's movie provided no specific backdrop to his character. All we knew was - he had a drunk and abusive father. Joaquin's Joker also wants to watch the world burn but his movie justifies his stance. The latter one succeeds in connecting with the audience while the former, leaves the audience speechless with his persona and his meticulous acts of complete madness all the while providing match up for his greatest nemesis - The Batman.
We don't see the intelligence or the brilliantly thought out plans of ""The Joker"" in this movie. The movie is more of a character study which is glorified by its actors. Joaquin Phoenix wins the Oscar for the Best Actor's Award for the ""Joker"". Yes you read it first here. The movie conveys a message. Probably an important one but the way it has been carried out is wrong because of course - ""The Joker"" is a villain. You know, the bad guy who does bad stuff like mass murdering and carrying out bomb blasts. But then again, Joaquin Phoenix's excellence makes you oblivious to all of that. I am a massive ""Joker"" fan, I'll tell you that and I wanted Arthur to snap as quickly as possible and boom! Become the Joker and do the badass stuff. But believe me, Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is so strong and unreal that the audience is bound to connect with his character. It is as if you root for him to not snap. You feel uncomfortable when his colleagues bully him and you feel equally betrayed when he discovers the truth about his delusional mum. I still remember this one time, when the audience in the Hall cheered and hooted for ""The Joker"" when he went up to the talk show host and shot him dead. Such was the strength of Joaquin's performance that it compelled the audience to cheer for the worst sin a man could carry out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
""Joker"" is a masterpiece. You have read it hundreds of times and you read it again here. You go to the theatre expecting nothing because you probably know it has nothing to do with the DCEU, but when you come out, you somehow develop a soft spot for the most infamous comic book villain of all time. And all of this is credited to Joaquin Phoenix's performance.Starting from the iconic ""Joker"" laugh to an evident insanity in his eyes, everything good about his performance is a major plus for this movie. He carries the movie all along and he is present with his mesmerizing persona in each and every frame of it. The audience loves ""The Joker"". The more you give him to them, the better the movie becomes. That's how you win the critics -&gt; Warner Bros. "
2394," Just wow
"," Its just amazing.
And yeah it's not for children and marvel "
2395," This should be the world's last chance of having a movie with 9/10 rating this decade
"," It's obvious I would say this movie is amazing, it gave me some feels this and that, but guys, pls don't let this movie diminish it's rating to 8, of all the movies that came out from 2010 to 2019, at least one should be 9/10, Endgame tried, almost succeeded, now let's leave Joker 9/10 pls "
2396," Haunting...
", Amazing acting by Phoenix !!! The character is still haunting... You never know what he will do 
2397," I don't know why there are still many people hate the movie
", You need to give a 10 for this movie because of the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. 
2398," The only project highlighting mental illness

2399," Powerful
"," It's a great film, very powerful. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips should both get Oscars. End of story. "
2400," Heath will be so proud!!
"," It's my first ever review so it ll be very short. In one line all i can say is ""MUST WATCH""<br/><br/>A brilliant new take on the Crown price of Crime. The movie is dark, gritty and makes you very uncomfortable whilst questioning our understanding of morals about black, white and grey. Joaqin Phoenix just blew it out of the park. On par with Ledger's performance. Must watch !! "
2401," Prequel to the dark knight trilogy
"," This is the best DC movie since the dark knight (part 2) and you can consider it prequel to batman begins
Great performance from phenix to joker character development from a regular mentally unstable person to the most famous criminal in the world which is completely different story from what ledger gave us as you can consider joker movie is the answer of the question: how could any human be the joker ?
And the very first moment of this human as the joker then you watch ledger present the joker in his prime after mastering criminal methods and have his followers
Joker along side batman begins and the dark knight gave us a great saga and if DC want more glory thy can make one or two more movie to complete what could happen in the future of the dark knight between batman and joker to make historical saga can compete with infinity saga and Star Wars "
2402," Brutal. Unnerving. Shocking.
"," This is more like mystic river, primal fear, higher learning or crash than a typical superhero movie. The acting was great. Maybe Oscar worthy. The movie kept me glued to my seat. It is too unnerving. I can't decide whether to pity or despise the Joker. He's crazy, but most people in Gotham are no saints.
I'm glad I did not take my 14 year old daughter to watch it, though. It's PG15, but it must have been just shy of getting an R.
Why the 8 instead of a10? Because I try to avoid movies this strong and stressing. I feel I was tricked into watching it. It's a great movie of the kind I'd almost rather not have watched. "
2403," Great
"," Great movie, just wish there was more joker when he becomes joker. "
2404," CONSIDER ME wowed
"," Joker is amazing, film is unique and creative, music is wonderful and the story is a poetic masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix Is surely going to take a oscar to his home "
2405," Terror every minute.
"," Joaquin Phoenix is great. no one can doubt that, he delivers one of his best performances ever.
The movie is about Arthur, every move and look he made, we in it, and about the cruelty he faced in the society.
The build up in his character from a clown to a JOKER was great, how he convinced himself that the life is funny not serious and how he acted upon that and became the JOKER.
The permanent panic in this movie was hard to take and disturbing sometimes, but it's reflect the darkness in Gotham.
Todd Phillips inspired by the character in ""Taxi Driver"" to create his JOKER, and it was kind of familiar for Joaquin Phoenix in two movies ""The Master"" and ""You Were Never Really Here"".
The score was great and it has a unique role in the scenes, and the cinematography was striking, every shot is unforgettable.
I can't say that it was a good time but it felt like the truth and we have to live it.
Lets see what he can get in the awards season and I'd like to see a big recognition for Joaquin Phoenix. "
2406," Should be 18A here in Canada instead of 14A
"," Saw it this Afternoon, was really good film to see but however tho, I won't recommend parents taking their children to see it! Joaquin Phoenix getting praised on his performance as Arthur Fleck/ Joker! You should check this film out, don't you forget it! "
2407," It's simply a masterpiece
"," This movie is amazing in every way. Joaquin Phoenix really nailed the role as the crazy, psychotic Joker. He was the perfect actor for this role and without him the movie would not be the same. The story is very good and well-written, and a lot of people seem to agree with me. Everyone should definitely take the chance to go watch it while it's still in theaters. Don't listen to the bad reviews, most of them expected this movie to just be another superhero vs villain movie where the Joker is just a boring old villain with a clown's face. No, this is not one of those films. This is a much darker, more original villain movie that focuses on the problems in our society. So, go watch the movie in theatres while you still can! "
2408," Ridiculously amazing
"," Go see it. Best movie ever. Brilliant acting, chemistry, character development, direction, sound, etc. Dark and gritty. No other movie is like this. See it, then see it again. "

Joker is dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should..soundtracks,‚ù§frank Sinatra‚ù§, acting, directing and screenplay piece of art.
His laugh, his movements and his slow transformation from Arthur Fleck to Joker..Anybody who's watching this film has to appreciate how Phoenix committed himself to this role, he deserves every acting award possible ,Oscars winner definitely "
2413," I love this movie
"," I really like this movie, this amazing, this not a convencional comic movie, the movie only take a comic book character, one of the best villain, and write a drama history, arthur fleck that think his life is not relevant and trasforn his madness in a simbol of villaness for gotham city poor people "
2414," Fantastic! A masterpiece! A breath a fresh air!
", Well what can I say that hasn't been said already! I just got back from seeing it and I have to say nearly the whole film I was on the edge of my seat! It's so tense! The performances are all amazing and joaquin phoenix portrayal of the Joker was astonishing! I can't praise it enough! Don't go into this film thinking it will be like a normal comic book film cause it wont! This is an adults Comic book (infant i wouldn't even think of it as a comic book adaptation) This is a Joker I've waited to see for a very long time! GO AND SEE JOKER NOW!! 
2415," Beyond Sensational
"," This movie was beyond sensational. Had all the makings to make it feel like a completely standalone film, you find yourself forgetting it's apart of the Gotham Universe.<br/><br/>The plot progression didn't tire for a single moment, and unlike many films where there's a scene that could have been left out, not a second of this film felt unnecessary.<br/><br/>The cinematography took my breath away at times, and the score was moving to say the absolute least.<br/><br/>Outstanding acting, Joaquin created a brand new joker to fall in love, incomparable to previous Jokers - not necessarily better or worse, just incomparable. He has created a Joker we have never seen before. "
2416," Heath Ledger would be proud!
"," Joker is not only Oscar worthy for Joaquin Pheonix's stunning performance but also the well written and directed story that is brought to the big screen. I thought all the hype was ridiculous and the movie was overrated but after watching it, I consider it to be one of the best films of all time. A film has never gripped me with such an emotional experience by maintaining the perspective of the disturbed Arthur Fleck from start to finish. "
2417," Joaquin Pheonix Too Good For Oscar
", What a Masterpiece !!! Joaquin Pheonix showed the side of Joker we have never witnessed. A unique take on the Joker passing thru all the madness and what a Performance. Too Damn Good. 
2418," The ""Better"" Taxi Driver
"," As I was leaving the Theater I had a multitude of thoughts, a slew of emotions, and a grinning smile across my face. Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job, expressing many complex emotions through a broken character, a character you begin to feel sorry for as people make fun of him, beat him down, and disregard him as a person.<br/><br/>It's oddly relatable, yet terrifying as the movie goes on. Arthur Fleck carries the screen with this aura of a broken man that thinks like a child yet looks like an adult. You can't take take your eyes off the screen seeing this awkward outcast being beaten down, it's an evil pressure that builds over time.<br/><br/>You actually wish for him to succeed even when he resorts to violent murder upon the people who make fun of him, while throughout the film Arthur brutally kills five people, which one of them consists of a brutally terrifying stabbing upon one of his ex-coworkers, and another of him snuffing his own mother with a pillow.<br/><br/>Concerning the depressing nature of this movie, and the political uproar it has caused. I think, It's all needed, it belongs, and it does justice. So much so, that it doesn't feel like a DC Movie, and weirdly enough I think that helps it? I can't exactly pin-point why, but many people say this film could've been it's own thing but I just don't think it would've been as good as it was, on that note I can't explain why this combo works so well but I guess the more people who talk about it, the more praise it will get!<br/><br/>Concerning the soundtrack of this movie, it's MESMERIZING! It's creepy, and I love the way it builds suspense when you don't know what will happen next. Hildur Gudnadottir really did our ears justice, even the songs scattered through the movie were perfectly presented, I personally enjoyed ""White Room"" by Cream a lot when he was in the back of that squad car watching the riots around him, just to finally see Arthur looking happy at all of the chaos he influenced. Truly did put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Concerning the look of this movie, it's beautifully sweet in a gritty dirty way. To Arthur's makeup, to the clown masks people wore. The colors really pop and I love the way they shot this movie, great camera work and not a boring part of this 2 hour film. Really well paced.<br/><br/>On the note of it being compared to Taxi Driver, I couldn't agree more. I had the same thought when I left the theater, and I personally think the Joker had more of an excuse to do the violent things he did, even if it was wrong. In Taxi Driver I felt like the main character just wanted to kill someone just to have his life known, or have purpose.<br/><br/>In Joker's defense, his life is miserable and everyone around him including the people on television make fun of him. All of his physiological problems, mixed with his uncontrollable painful sounding laugh is sad. He decides to kill himself on Live Television as his finale, to end his miserable purposeless existence in a cruel hating world... And finally when he thinks he'll get a break, the plan changes as his final joke was messed up and ridiculed to be not funny.<br/><br/>Even though he was a sad clown, he truly made me laugh when he was finished, That's Life. "
2419," Godlike
"," Stunning movie!<br/><br/>Let's give Joaquin a huge applaude, he delivered one of the hardest roles in history a mesmerizing and amazing performance, this is something that we will remember for years! Heath ledger would be proud. Much darker version than I'd expected, the movie definitely reached my expectations, with the realistic, dark and gore joker. They finished the loose ends and made us realize how ""joker"" was made, all of the physicality and emotional depth that triggered Arthur Fleck's inner joker was stunning and pure. A role to remember!! "
2420," Sublime
"," Amazing film. Joaquin Phoenix' performance was second to none. Gritty, sometimes hard to watch but beautiful. The best film I've seen in years. "
2421," JOKER = MASTERPIECE = 10/10
"," JOKER is the best film of the year. Best experience of my life, this stunning movie demands a multiple viewing, you don't know what's real and what's not. JOKER is an experience inside JOKER mind and you feel like you in it. Joaquin Phoenix is going to win the best leading actor, and the cinematography and the music score are awesome they will be nominated or win oscars for their hard work, I seeing from now, this is going to win the best picture not only gets nominated but win. JOKER is a must see. "
2422," Movie of the Century!
"," #Joker is Perhaps the movie of the century. Joaquin Phoenix is beyond a legend. Every second of this period drama is exhilarating. His emotions , his demeanour , His body type - everything was executed to perfection.<br/><br/>Heath ledger would be proud of his replacement.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips - the writer and director has made an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film itself is essentially a prequal to the Dark Knight or to be specific the very birth of Batman.<br/><br/>His depiction of the classic villain touches upon more than what meets the eye - dealing with societal pressures , mob mentality and
Class disparity all in a very late 60's early 70's era.<br/><br/>This movie has the defining scene of Thomas Wayne and his wife being killed in a riot in the dark alley all in front of young Bruce.
This put a lot of the back story into context for future confontrations if and when Batman learns all this.<br/><br/>Warner Bro's has created an anti hero blockbuster to bring them right back into contention against the recent Marvel onslaught.<br/><br/>Ps : Robert DeNiro's cameos quite fun. Trust me wait for the end.*Spoiler Alert* "
2423," The most amazing performance definitely deserving of an Oscar
", This movie is one of the best DC movies ever created a must watch Heath Ledger would be proud of such an amazing performance by Phoenix. 
2424," Joker Review - Astonishing
"," Todd Phillips provides us with the masterful child of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"". The inspirations from both are clear throughout, but Joker manages to make a name for itself. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's phenomenal score provided a symphony for Arthur's crude yet hypnotic dancing and inspired emotion and darkness when you least expected it. The powerhouse of the movie was the lead actor. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck's descent into udder madness is astonishing. His weight loss, the sunken cheeks, and the greased hair, not to mention the laugh creates this persona of a deranged loner. Any time Joaquin would laugh due to his condition, there was an atmosphere change in the theatre. Everyone felt the power, the fear, and the anger behind it and it was truly captivating. The way he twists and turns his body in his never ceasing attempts to be liked or normal leaves you uneasy. You finally see the beauty in his madness as he dances down his very own stairway to heaven to the sound of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"". Amidst his aggressive, celebratory, and almost jubilant thrusting he's ushered into his rebirth into anarchy. De Niro was a phenomenal counterpart to Phoenix, and was part of the homage to the previous Scorsese movies. De Niro was subtle, while also providing a believable and comical idol. The final showdown between the two while expected, leaves you shocked by De Niro's alarming death. However, the movie comes to true fruition near the end. As Joker stands on top of the wrecked police car and turns his blood into the smile whilst the crowd cheers and riots. In this scene where Arthur stands in victory and everything has come together you can't help but cheer for him. This movie has reimagined the Joker into an iconic antihero, and it will be interesting to see where it goes from here. "
2425," I've seen sociopathy up close, this is the real deal!
"," This movie made me create an account to review it.
I've watched it twice in the cinema in 12 hours.
Here's the thing, I studied sociopathy for a few months after seeing it up close in a close person. Joaquin Phoenix didn't just deliver what may be the best performance an actor ever gifted the world (perhaps tied with Branston Cranston's Walter White in Breaking Bad).
But he behaves exactly like a sociopath does, with an origin story that perfectly maps that of many sociopaths - which I won't spoil you with.
He should get one Oscar for best actor, and one for accuracy and realism.
This is not just a movie, it a scientific achievement and it will be used by psychologists and psychiatrists for Aeons to come.
This movie is currently rated 9.2 despite Marvel fans voting it 1 star just to make Endgame higher.
Do the math and you'll see, that means that Joker is right now the highest rated movie in history. Anyone who criticizes Joaquin's perfomance is simply a fortunate person, who never actually met a sociopath and can't understand what they're seeing.
This movie will still be remembered a century from now. "
2426," He Pulled It Off
"," The first half leaves you wondering how this meek, empty shell of a man could ever become the sinister Joker. Then he flips the switch...slowly. I knew as soon as he started dancing down those stairs. I said to myself he really pulled it off. The weird quirks he develops before you are so unnerving, and gritty it makes you feel uncomfortable watching it. It was almost too realistic. But he did something special here. Epic movie "
2427," Shocked
", I was rather shocked when watching joker when I say shocked I mean it was excellent. I felt like it wasn't a stereotypical DC film which I loves as they did it different. For me this is one of the best movies that DC has made. The character portrayed in the film is outstanding it is very psychological with the emotions of the characters and we end up feeling attached to the character. I felt very sorry for him and then we end up routing for him. It was well executed and I would give it a perfect 10 . But all in all i can't complain as I loved it. 
2428," Oscar goes to Joaquin Phoenix...
"," Firstly Joker is the best cult movie I've seen in recent years. Joaquin Phoenix really lived the role. especially in the second half of the film we see the real joker. In the first half we see arthur. in fact, in the first half, arthur is a personality that shows the kindness, sacrifice and innocence that most of us want in real life. But joker in the second half is a person who shows that innocence and sacrifice do not actually mean anything to people. people's approach to us affects us. arthur has also transform Joker in a corrupt system. Did he deserve it? no. but the people of gotham deserved it.<br/><br/>I can't forget the movies. a really great movie. 10/10. "
2429," Amanzing

2430," A commentary on what we view as ""the villain""
"," Absolutely phenomenal. Pay no mind to journos and pseudo-intellectual critics who name the movie mediocre.
They're doing it because it actually talks about the problem with social alienation and mental health in our society, yet they're shills for big business interest groups that want the public hooked on consumer culture and nothing more.
And they wonder why mass shootings happen. Wouldn't be surprised to see Joker being disqualified for any awards. "

2435," Joker - the fight club of our generation
"," I've never written a review before. This movie deserves praise. It's not an action packed movie like fast &amp; furious. It's not some villain who's causing a good guy hassle but is good at that. This is a complex movie with layers that get unveiled very slowly.<br/><br/>I usually don't like slow burners but with Joaquin Pheonix in this movie, I was gripped. His acting can give you goosebumps. The cinematography is absolutely on point with the theme. The sound is really done well and creates some real hair raising moments.<br/><br/>What I like most of this movie is the uncertainty. There comes a point when you feel like you know where the movie is heading and you're just proved wrong. You don't know what the he's going to do next.<br/><br/>To further talk about the paragraph above I genuinely thought that he was going to kill himself on the show towards the end of the movie. I had doubts on whether this would happen until he teases one of the guys before he lets him go. At this point I was disappointed because I believed he would kill himself.<br/><br/>I like the fact that they show you some some things that you see are not real and it brings about a question of whether anything else could not be real.<br/><br/>Overall , this movie is really good. Joaquin Pheonix's perfomance is brilliant and at times unreal. This is one of the movies that will have to be rewatched.<br/><br/>I give this a solid 10/10. "
2436," Absolute Masterpiece
", The darkness of joker was brought to light!! Absolutely brilliantly written and perfectly executed 
2437," Greatest performance ever
"," I experienced this movie last night. And I say ""experienced"" because this movie completely engulfs you. It sucks you in if you allow it. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is absolutely amazing. I have never seen a performance like this from another actor. Closes would be Adrien Brody in the Pianist. The movie twist and turns into a beautiful piece of artwork. I truly hope that we see Joaquin Phoenix as the joker again and I hope we dont have to wait two years to do so.<br/><br/>I plan on seeing this movie again, soon. "
2438," An Amazing take on Joker!
"," Amazing! It stays true to cannon while not feeling like a comic book movie. Its dark and tragic. amazingly well acted. great visuals, its just a sad, dark movie that's an origin story of the joker.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a 2nd movie with Joaquin Phoenix as the joker. "
2439," Refreshing piece of art after all those stupid superhero movies
"," I don't usually make comment but this is a must see movie. Everything is so up to the point , the acting, the music, the songs and the background. It relates so much of the world that we are living in. It's really sad that some people are very arrogant to believe that everyone is living in a wonderful world, only because they are too precious to go on streets to find out the truth "
2440," By far a good reimagined film about Joker
"," I saw Joker last night and man it was intense, interesting, very well done, and nice to see a different perspective of Gothem City through the eyes of how Arthur became Joker.
I watched a couple of reviews on youtube before going in to the theater and the one thing I took from the reviews was how this film represents how someone can eqaily snap in an instant and become emotionally and mentally unstable to turn to their life into commiting crime because no one would listen and that you feel like no one cares. And the only way to get back at the world is to commit crime so that people would notice and pay attention.
I would definitely by this on Blu ray. It was nice to have more of Joker and to also see how we get introduced to the Wayne family in a dark way. I was really happy that they made this rated how so we can see how Arthur lost control and how we got to see him from chapter 1 all the way to the end.
I would Higley recommend you guys go see it or at least wait till it comes out on digital and dvd and Blu ray and watch it for yourself. I never once looked at my watch or anything and kept my eyes on the screen to understand how a mentally ill person can just loose it. "
2441," Excellent Performance!
"," Joker is the first comic book character made real and he's much more terrifying in this film than any previous incarnation of the super villain. Even if this movie were not about a DC character, it would stand alone as a brilliant portrayal of madness both of a man and the world he inhabits. "
2442," The average movie watcher isn't ready for this...
"," This movie is bonkers! Joaquin Phoenix is a shoe-in for best actor, and I would not be shocked one bit if it wins best picture.<br/><br/>I hate to say it; this is not the film for the average movie watcher. I know most of my extended family would be terrified and disgusted.<br/><br/>I think the film industry needs daring films like this. In actuality, it shows a LOT of reality within our society.<br/><br/>Strap in people and be blown away by this crazy ride! "
2443," What A Joke
"," What an amazing movie. I love how this movie is different from any other comic book movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible, he definitely deserves an Oscar for this role. The cinemarography in this movie is also perfect. I love Todd Phillips' directing, this definitely his best movie to date. Personally, 'Joker' is one of the best movie of the year (if it's not the best) and probably a top 3 comic book movie of all time, i really hope this movie win an oscar. "
2444," Wow!
"," Can't even believe the basic and stupid bad critics to this masterpiece. You know nothing about acting, directing and post production work if you don't like this movie. From the beginning to the end it's a delicious journey into this perturbed mind and how every act is introduced is incredible surprising. I think the people don't like it is because they were looking for big explosions, stupid CGI and poor acting as they are used to in MCU movies. Oscar will say the truth ;) "
2445," Psychological and Dark
"," Very well directed... No comparison with Ledger, but Joaquin Phoenix has done it brilliant!! The story becomes more intense and dark towards the end leaving you awestruck for sometime!!
A good psycho movie rather than a CGI movie!! Already started imagining Heath Ledger in this movie!! "
2446," This man deserves an oscar
"," Absolutely was shook by this movie &amp; enraptured by the world conveyed onscreen. Beyon the performance, this movie is important. I believe that whole heartedly. This movie was Beautifully sad, relevant, and an overall disturbing &amp; cerebral movie. This movie is about the causes of alienation, not the symptoms. Can honestly say I don't think I've ever been so fully convinced by a performace like jaoquins. I just hope ppl can look past Heath ledgers &amp; judge this on its own. "
2447," Great character study, nothing to be scared about
"," Too many movies out there of unhinged characters that are way more problematic to blame this one for the state of violence in America. In fact, it matches the tone def blame Gotham has in the movie for the first act, anger at a vigilante clown, and not the state of society and lack of social services that got them there. Excellent cast, wonderful performance, and shame on all the people who vilified it for personal gain. While it might not be for everyone, especially those not interested in delving into the origins of a mad killer character, there are even more gruesome origin stories out there, this one doesn't deserve all this solo negative attention. "
2448," Phoenix and Phillips craft a masterpiece
"," This is the greatest depiction of a comic book charachter in a movie of all time. Phoenix inhabits this man outcast by society and destined to be the greatest villain Gotham has ever known, and puts his all into it. His performance of a man who's been persecuted his whole life for his mental conditions was immaculate. He brings this charachter to life like no one ever has (Ledger included). Another aspect that can't be swept under the rug is how Impressive of a directing job Phillips did. The fact that he is able to move from directing some of the most renound comedies of all time, to crafting this intense character piece is a credit to his unbelievable skill. The Joker has always been depicted as existing in a world outside of ours, but in this dark drama it's accuratley shown what it would be like if this villain actually existed in the real world. An aspect of this film that's likely not going to get as much attention as it should from general audiences is the score. It's brilliant, and elevates this movie to a whole other level. Don't even hesitate if thinking about watching this movie, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this expertly conceived world. "
2449," It was very American Psycho.
"," No spoilers. Like all origin stories it spends way too much time in character development. It also telegraphed it punches. Its is worth seeing just to watch Joaquin Phoenix's performance. It just that the movie did not seem to get the Joker character himself. Their simply was no sense of menace from the Joker, even toward the end of the movie. violence yes, but no menace. Yes I know some people will say the Joker is suppose to use his brain, not his brawn, but if so they did not even show that. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was amazing, but it simply did not convey ""The Joker"" like Heath Ledger, or even Jack Nicholson. IMHO even Jared Leto did a better job. The movie was as indicated above is very American Psycho, in tone, and delivery, including the message, if it was trying to portray a message, which I doubt, because that would have indicated a plot outside of decent into madness. FYI a group of teens left the movie about half way through, it obviously was not what they expected. "
2450," Best origin story ever told!!!!!
"," Move over Heath ledger there's a new kid in town!!
Macabre and low-fi gold. With out a doubt the best origin story ever told.
Absolute brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
Sad redemption that will blow your mind!!! "
2451," What makes the perfect villain?
",
2452," Still in shock.
", Just got done seeing it and wow. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. 
2453," The man behind the smile
"," This movie is stunning. The music, the cinematography, the acting! Mr. Phoenix outdoes himself in this film. He brings humanity to this character. In the beginning, I feel very sorry for him. I wish I could reach into the screen and let him know its okay. But the further he dives into madness, the more powerful he feels. The happier he seems. JOKER is a movie I cannot express into words. JOKER is a movie you must see for yourself. "
2454," Joaquin Phoenix is a genius
"," A watch the movie one hour ago. This is Joaquin Phoenix masterpiece. His role as main actor is exceptional. Not sure where the movie ends and where Joaquin acting starts. Amazing movie, hope he wins the Oscar. He truly deserves it. "
2455," Masterpiece!
"," I have NEVER seen a movie that made me feel the way this one did. No joke. It's viseral, it's raw, it's deep, it's incredibly heart wrenching and the acting was exquisite. I felt a heaviness in my chest like I've never felt before; and I could legitimately feel the pain and downward spiral into insanity with the character.<br/><br/>*Note- this movie is not for everyone. It is NOT a traditional villain/vigilante movie. It's a 2 and a half hour long character study on one of the most infamous DC villains. Don't go into it thinking you've read it from a comic, because you haven't. One of the best versions of a Joker origin ever. Period. "
2456," Stop comparison!
"," Now we're all figure out, that is Heath Ledger was continuing what Joaquin Phoenix will start in the future!<br/><br/>PUT A HAPPY FACE :) "
2457," GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
"," THANK YOU JOAQUIN, I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS MASTERPIECE!!! "
2458," WOW SUCH A MASTERPIECE!!!!!
", Coming in as a huge DC fan. This movie hit every right corner!! Joaquin delivered on so many levels and I hope he stays the joker for a long time!! Joaquin did stuff better than Heath ledger. Overall perfect joker movie 100/10 
2459," Joaquin Phoenix becomes my favourite actor

", Just go watch it... Theres really no need to review anything. Its up to viewers on what they formulate about the flim... 
2462," Plucked from the golden age of film
", Movies like joker haven't existed since taxi driver. A breath of fresh air during an era where we are suffocated with explosions and cgi. 
2463," We just watched classic of 10/20s
"," A perfect psychological journey portrayed through the Joker appearance. A movie about humanity, the lower class of society and mental issues. Overall art work at its peak. This acting will be an example to all students. My guess is that he will get an Oscar.10/10 "
2464," Immersive!
",
2465," Best actor ever
", Joaquin proves once more that he is can outstand any expectation. His acting is epic and the character is monumental. Such a privelege to see him on the screen. 
2466," Not a masterpiece. But it is an outstanding DC Comics film
",
2467," Wanna watch it again to process it..
", I think this movie is the answer to why every nerd enjoyed and read comics to everyone who ever did not understand. Darkness personified...! 
2468," Film of the decade
", I hope this is appreciated in its time not 20 years later as a cult classic 
2469," JUST .... PERFECT
"," Joacquin Phoenix just made his BEST FRIEND, Heath Ledger smile from Heaven in the name of JOKER!<br/><br/>Every move he made, every laugh, every dialogue. Just PERFECT. The story-building is very detail, I feel like I can relate to Arthur's feelings. When I saw the movie, I had this mixed-feelings where I can't even express what I feel.<br/><br/>This just pure ART. A masterpiece.<br/><br/>I can't even!! "
2470," MASTERPIECE
"," I'm so emotional when i saw this movie!!!
Almost related with real life and about the actor, i love his expression !<br/><br/>scene by scene that's so detail how he smile, how he talk...<br/><br/>Really, this's so amazing !!! "
2471," Great movie
"," This movie shows the life before joker, which shows us how the character develops and becoming the joker. It also connects batman's appearance in the next years. Really good film "
2472," The Best Movie I've Ever Watched
"," This is the one that deserves to beat The Shawshank Redemption and with all due respect, I would give Joaquin's performance the best Joker title, he is really deep and dark and thats exactly what we want to see from an actor in this type of a character, simply an OSCAR Worthy Performance. Plus, this picture is so clean and it feels like you're watching a movie from hollywood's golden age, really thank you Todd Phillips. "
2473," This joker isn't joking around.
"," This movie should be watched without prejudice and other cultural biases as ""critics"" often do.<br/><br/>I viewed in on pre-premier and was really happy that it meeted all my expectations. It has a slow flow while packing heavy load of context for each scene. The more I seen the less my DC comic knowledge was involved in story and more real-life it seemed. The last bits that crumbled Jokers hopes in society was shattering for me to. I expected for him to embrace evil from first scenes knowing how cruel Joker is in comics, but Phoenix painfully suffered for more than I could think and he was fighting until last minutes. For me this is the film of the year, it is too deep for it's own good. "
2474," Phoenix The Best
"," Just unbelievable Masterpiece Movie, Acting was Amazing, will get definitely Oscar. "
2475," Reality on point.
"," Brilliant acting, great story and damn on point.....
'Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?' "
2476," Awesome
"," The best movie of the year
Every one needs to watch it "
2477," Speechless, stunning
"," I went in with low expectations since the main appeal of the Joker is that he doesn't have a definite background story. As for Joaqu√≠n's acting skills, I wasn't that skeptical since he's definitely known for some amazing performances. But I truly wasn't expecting it to be on par with Heath Ledger's performance! You thought The Dark Knight was dark? Go see Joker and you will definitely be stunned. The cinematography was gorgeous, the soundtracks even more amazing... A few scenes will stay with me (or haunt me) forever. Joker is so good that it can be viewed as a must-see ""preview"" of the Dark Knight. I'm not sure the Oscar's will do this movie justice. Winning the Golden Lion Award said enough about this masterpiece. "
2478," One of the bestttttt movie ive ever watched!!!
"," Its insanely insanely great movie! very depressing and dark , and just insanely greattttttt! gonna watch it again soon for d second time! "
2479," Spectacular!
"," Joaquin Phoenix's performance gives chills, no words can describe his talent.<br/><br/>Direction is another pleasure! didn't expect this from Todd Philips<br/><br/>Music!!! oh god!<br/><br/>Can't say and think of anything, you MUST SEE THIS! "
2480," Best movie EVER
"," This movie has everything that your heart desires. Great background score, great camera angle and an amazing storyline. I can't find words to describe the performance by Joaquin Phoenix so I won't even try but that man has set the standards SO high that even he won't be able to cross them. All in all, it's the best I've ever seen and it's a shame that critics are doing what they do and bring down talented people with their horrible writing. "
2481," WHAT KIND OF MASTERPIECE IS THIS?
"," Very emotional drama! When Arthur laugh because he's been hurt, it's tears me down. But sadly, the audience of my local theater is so stupid, they laugh.<br/><br/>The last few minutes is so epic. "
2482," Brilliant

2483," Best movie and best acting

2484," Dark, Moving & Beautiful
",
2485," Confronting and masterful
"," I did not know what to expect from this film but what I walked away with was an appreciation of the master of his craft that is Joaquin Phoenix. His gradual metamorphosis into a man disconnected and disassociated with society and its norms is quite simply brilliant. No other actor could have performed this role so well. He is mesmerising. The story is riveting and confronting. The city of Gotham, covered in rubbish and rats is a powerful metaphor for the decay of society and its civility. It is represented as cruel, cold, and degenerating into chaos. There is no reprieve, no hero to save the day. We are exposed to our real selves otherwise hidden by the mask worn by Arthur Fleck. The script, cinematography and score are sublime but Phoenix is the star of this film and must win an Oscar for this role. There is no performance in recent times that compares to it. "
2486," It's not a fun movie, It's a great movie!
"," It is surely not your typical superhero movie. It is fresh, from perspective and storyline. When i walked out the cinema i saw people saying this movie is not as good as they expected. But for me it is a great movie, sure it's no fun and a bit dark. So i think this movie is not suitable for all people. Joaquin Pheonix sure is the man! "
2487," Just a MASTERPIECE
"," This movie is great from the start to the finish.
Phoeinix's Joker is amazing. He managed to successfully portray a psychopath that was treated like garbage from the society in the best way. The story is pretty much incredible. The photography is beautiful. This movie has everything a perfect movie must have. Definitely an Oscar winning performance from Phoenix and surely many other nominations such as best cinematography etc. must be added. "
2488," Oscar is coming
", Oscar is coming baby 
2489," It's Dark!!! it's gritty!!!! and it's mind blowing!!!..... everything a DC fan wants!!!!
"," The movie is all about an iconic comic book character but the story telling has made it an masterpiece. An one of kind movie which doesn't make you feel like an ordinary comic book movie but as a study of a mind slowly spiralling into madness untill he becomes insanity itself.
At the end you just fall in love with Joaquin phoenix's Joker. Todd Phillips has really started something which will be phenomenonal in the future..... trust me it's just a startüÉèü§°ü§°üÉè "
2490," TRAGIC!!!
"," Tragic? Yes. That's the first word that came to my mind after leaving the theater watching this movie. This movie gonna show you how tragic his life from beginning to end. How he tried to be good but it eventually became bad, how he tried to maintain his sane mind despite knowing that he doesn't. You gonna feel his struggle, his pain, everything he's going through in the entire movie. And you can understand why he did that despite knowing what he's doing is wrong. For me, this is Joaquin best performances. Is it deserve an Oscar? Absolutely, dude stole the show. well not stole, I mean, he IS the show. 10/10 "

2492," Didn't live up to the hype
"," I just came from a screening of Joker and if I'm honest, I really don't see what all the fuss was about. Did people really walk out of this?! I was expecting a multi-layered descent in to mental illness, instead this felt a bit one dimensional and just a rehash of the same old character. It's by no means a terrible film, its just not the Oscar bait it's been made out to be. "
2493," Load of shxx
"," Tge film is too Slowt gets boring
Ok story line
Good acting from joker
I dont know what all this hype is about "
2494," The most overrated movie of all time
", Don't get me wrong it's not awful the acting is very good but good god this film is a hard watch boring and seen so much of the story in other films who ever put together the advertising should get a Oscar for getting such a buzz for a ok film .. 
2495," It should have been Commodus (Gladiator) 19 years ago - It'll be Arthur Fleck
",
2496," Overacting, overselling, overrated
"," It's sad to see that people do not have their own opinions and they will like whatever is trending in pop culture.<br/><br/>The acting from Joaquin Phoenix started good. Than he starts to oversell it. Every 10 minutes he either laughed very hard or danced around. He was like Jim Carry. That was his acting. And people are thinking that he deserves an oscar. There is a very thin line between crazy and psycho. Joker is a very dark psycho person, that makes his character unique. What Joaquin represented was flat crazy trying to be a psycho. An epic fail.<br/><br/>But his acting still the best thing in this picture. There were some good scenes but the story, logic, sound editing and designing sucked. They tried to hype some scenes with a very laud music which will come to you attention because of the lack of the professionalism.<br/><br/>I liked the cinematography. It catches the darkness and the dangerousness of the situation. The lightning also played a very big part in this success. It made some scenes much better.<br/><br/>To sum things up, there in no way, this movie deserves an oscar, it shouldn't even be considered for it. I am really disappointed. I've waited something more dark and more psychological. Very disappointed "
2497," Boring
", This movie was so boring. Also it was so over hyped and pretentious and self mastabutory. There were some good bits in the 3rd act but overall a disappointment. The music was good though. 
2498," Boring
"," This movie is so boring, 90% useless stuff, 10% story plot.
Looks like everyone in Gotham is a bad guy who daily beats the Joker. A typical hollywood where the good guy is taken to a back alley, gets beaten up AND in a late night metro a girl is being harassed and our guy gets beaten up again. I see there are a lot of DC fanboys out there who will like anything having their favorite comic character with or without plot. If you like ""Breaking Bad"", ""Interstellar"" etc, this is s*** "
2499," The realism is unnerving
", The film highlights the real damage mental instability can cause in a person. The film was so correct it almost made me feel uncomfortable. 
2500," Not bad
"," It is good but not amazing movie.
Cinematography 10
Acting 9
Others 5.5 "
2501," A psycho thriller that has much to say
"," I went to the movies with two friends: one totally loved and it the other totally hated hated the film.<br/><br/>The picture is a masterpiece that deserves attention and these are several important ideas that I believe many people are missing to see:<br/><br/>NOT THEIR FAULT.
the Joker is a somebody born into this world with some form of physical (and perhaps mental) disability. He is sent to a foster home where his crazy mother adopts him from. She further shapes his faith ""downwards"". On top of that her abusive boyfriends that tie him and beat him and his mother. Imagine how damaging that is to a child's brain. Imagine if that were you. Were you going to become the person you are today? Most likely not.<br/><br/>LAUGHING AT THEM, NOT WITH THEM.
Director shows graphically how non-empathetic people can be to this sort of people. It's easy to throw a hurtful comment to make you laugh, but it's always at their expense. So in the end he was pushed to the wall and started shooting.<br/><br/>KILLING HIS MOTHER.
should he have done it? Did she save him or hurt him? Was it her fault she was crazy, which then hurt him? Would he be better without her? All open questions that make sense.<br/><br/>SHOOTING THE HOST.
He went to the studio with the intent to kill himself, but then survival instincts took over I guess. The host started blaming him for his action which triggered him. A life full of pain felt they never wanted to recognize his pain, only because it's more convenient for them this way.<br/><br/>BECOMING A LEADER.
In the final scene, after a life of pain and suffering, fully rejected by society, for the first time in his life, he becomes a leader and people start admiring and following him. They put him on the hood of the red car. They actually followed him for his madness, not for the wisdom he voiced out before shooting De Niro. A masterful way to show that HAVING FOLLOWERS, LIKES, and FANS does not mean a person has true ""value"".<br/><br/>On the one hand, YOU HAVE 1000 LIKES ON FACEBOOK FOR THE WRONG REASON. On the other you have 1 dislike for the right reasons. WHICH ARE YOU PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO? "
2502," Who knew

2507," Grim, artistic and deadly cautionary tale-Joker is good but not super
",
2508," Dark and interesting story on the origin of The Joker
"," After watching reboots of the Bruce Wayne/Batman origins, it was interesting to see this take on the origins of The Joker.
Joaquin Phoenix is great playing the character and taking everyone down the rabbit hole of mental illness, betrayal, depression, schizophrenia and ultimately homicide. At one point, I almost felt sorry for the character as the story continues and his life got darker. "
2509," the end was the beginning
"," Im not sure whether I enjoyed the movie, but it left me with themes to think. Whether everything happened as a delusion or in reality,is a question. The actor's talent is best reflected through character. But its hard to justify giving death as punishment. Still a lot more to think about even after finishing watching movie. "
2510," Film of the year, Best Actor
"," Really brilliantly done. Direction, story and acting was all superb, A+. This film will win multiple Oscars. Must see on big screen. Dark, bizzare, and twistedly surprising! Some people say it was slow, I didn't think that at all. It was phycologically thrilling and I don't think I blinked. It flowed beautifully and Heath Ledger would have been proud. This role was made for J. Phenoix. Killed it! Loved it! But do not take your kids. The suicidal references and cold blooded raw material not entertaining or suitable for a kid. "
2511," A deep, dark, refreshing character study
"," Personally, I am tired of the constant superhero-related movies being churned out as of late. But as soon as I saw the trailer for Joker I knew this would be different. It turned out, I was right. We follow Arthur Fleck, a deeply troubled man, alienated from society due to his mental instability. Most notably, his spontaneous fits of laughter.
We watch a man grow unhinged, further and further into insanity, and we understand why. We even, maybe, feel bad for him. Arthur was constantly ridiculed, beat, thrown under the bus, just because he was an easy target. I think most of us can emphasize in this sense, at one point or another in our lives.
This film is undeniably depressing, a portrayal of the depraved corners of the mind. It also, ironically enough, has plenty of comedy intertwined, which is wonderfully balanced.
This is probably one of the best movies of the year, bar none. Nobody is wrong to say it's gory and over-the-top violent, but it's not all for nothing. See it for yourself. "
2512," I am an adult....
"," I am an adult who knows the line between fiction and reality.I know it sound crazy....but I would of wanted to be more darker,more disturbing.The Joker has to be insane and violent.It should be an adult movie full of violence.They made it more children oriented instead. "
2513," Have a laugh now and then
"," Normally, I love DC movies... well some at least. But this one blew my mind. I was happy. Joker was everything I wanted it to be. A crazed psychopath killing his victims, and struggling through society rather than the same old falling in Ace Chemicals situation. I was genuinely shaking through the whole movie, it was disturbing to watch, so be warned. "
2514," No words .
", A masterpiece .POINT AT THE END OF THE LINE. 
2515," A movie unafraid to approach mature concepts. Near perfection in its execution.
"," Simply one of the most meaningful movies I've seen, possibly ever. I don't even mean that flippantly or with glib offhand comment.<br/><br/>Despite the fact it is 'based upon' a comic character, the acting, the script, the direction, the lighting, the pacing, everything in this movie was, in my very humble opinion, perfect.<br/><br/>I've seen this film twice now, and while I must admit it is a film that might push the wrong buttons for some folk, to me, this is an exact and detailed exploration of some very mature themes, while remaining true in the canon of it's 'world'.<br/><br/>I could explain every small thing I found to be exceptional about this film, but to do so, I'd have to recite the movie from start to end. Instead, I can only recommend that you see this film.<br/><br/>Don't expect to feel good at the end, but go and see it and then think on what you saw. It's not a nice movie, it's not a movie to enjoy, it a movie that is to be seen. "
2516," Wow! Just Wow!

2517," Perfect symphony
"," The best DC movie after the dark knight.
Can't wait to see how it's developed. "
2518," Whatever the critics might say, Joker will go down in the history of film!
"," This makes the End Game a joke (yep and it is called Joker). For me, it even surpasses The Dark Knight. In this move, Joker is more than just a villain, he is an icon, a symbol and a legend!<br/><br/>The script is already good enough but Joaquin Phoenix took it to another level. To see him dance around and kill people, somehow, is an art in this title. Seriously, some parts of the movies are scarier than many horror films.<br/><br/>Well, I just cannot praise it enough. Let say the TOP 3 best film of any genres in 2019 period! "

"," I see all these reviews suggesting Arthur Fleck is an incel but I haven't yet seen a single review justifying that categorisation of the character. Yes, he is single, white and like most single people doesn't want to be that. The missing part is he doesn't show any signs of misogyny nor racism. Furthermore, despite the fact that at least 4 mass murders committed in North America by men who either ""self-identified as incels or who had mentioned incel-related names and writings in their private writings or Internet postings"", Arthur Fleck's participation in the movement against the elites is by and large accidental as he did not kill the three ""Wall Street"" guys to make a political statement but it was rather an act of personal nature. That is not to say that he doesn't ride the wave that he unwillingly created by the end of the film but the original intention to incite mass violence was not there, nor any other negative connotations associated with the incel subculture. I fully agree that the film is a brilliant deconstruction of prevalent social and political narratives and whatever you think the true narrative is, you will be proven wrong in the next segment of the movie. Astonishing acting and score. A masterpiece. "

2524," Not Revolutionary
"," Joker is not the comic book movie to flip the genre on it's head; purely because, besides the name and aesthetics of The Joker, Joker is not at all about the renowned DC Villain. Whilst it's merits are plentiful, it also has many downfalls. I found myself bored half way through and it only picks up about half an hour before the end. If you're a fan of Scorsese then you'll love this homage to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but if you're a Joker diehard then you may find yourself disappointed. Nevertheless, by the end I found myself somewhat satisfied and definitely entertained by that incredible final act so watch it if you want but I would advise against going if you're emotionally fragile or venerable; it gets dark. "
2525," Outstanding! Brilliant!
"," This movie deserves the wolrd! I cannot even express how much i enjoyed watching it! I am so ready to give it a second go and watch it again, in order to analyze all the details that I've missed! This movie sheds light upon mental illness, especially how childhood abuse influences your adult life and how society can actually turn you into a monster. It shows the involution of Arthur and how his tragic life develops and transforms into a comedy, driving him into complete madness. The movie shows the differences between the poor and the rich and shows the struggles of the real world. This movie is real, it is a psychological action drama that shows us how raw humanity is and what the consequences of untreated mental illness can lead to. This does not at all provoke anyone to start being violent or dress up as clowns and riot the streets. This makes the viewer analyze his own life, analyze his own moral values and realize for themselves what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil.
Joaquin Phoenix brought justice for the Joker, as I haven't seen such a good Joker since Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. Joaquin Phoenix, an actor that definitely deserves an Oscar, perfectly portrayed an unstable Arthur and a crazy Joker, that, in the end, were combined and became only one. His movements, facial expressions, tonality of voice, were sublime and brought mystery, darkness and truth to us all.
In the end, you won't know anymore what is real and what is not, as the enigmatic ending plays with your mind and leaves you with numerous unanswered questions. "
2526," The best film I have ever seen in my entire life, and likely always will be.
"," I have watched this movie 4 times so far at the theatres. The importance of the message in this film when it comes to mental illness, neglect, and abuse of those who just want happiness and equal-treatment is absolutely paramount and incredibly true to every day life in this struggling world. The performances (all of them, but especially Joaquin's) are perfect all the way through...but the scene that takes place on the Murray late show is the single best scene in cinema history, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Rating: Perfection/10 "
2527," JOKER IS A MUST SEE!
"," Masterpiece from beginning to end. From the cinematography to the acting.. It's extremely relatable and filled with necessary lessons and messages. The exploration of mental illness forces viewers to have a deeper understanding for not only Arthur Fleck/Joker, but people in OUR society. Joaquin's performance was impeccable as always. This movie was so mesmerizing and had me on an emotional rollercoaster. I didn't want it to end! Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Can't wait to see it again and again! "
2528," Joker
"," 8/10 - this slow-build of a drama features excellent performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Zazie Beetz, although I'm not sure I would want to see it again "
2529," A movie that will get you talking, for more right reasons than wrong
"," A vast, outstanding but sometimes slow character development followed by 20-25 minutes of the pure 'Joker' we know and hate to love. Villains and their backstories are not particularly exhibited at the silver screen however this private look into the backstory of Arthur Fleck and the social chaos that seamlessly brews to a boiling point just as Fleck has reached his offers a great and alternate view on how villains become just that. No super plan to take over the world, no strategy, just the fortune that anarchy needs a face, JOKER is that face. A good watch that gives you plenty to talk about in the office or the bar with your fellow movie buffs. "
2530," Joker - an instant comic book classic
"," Joker (2019)
Directed by Todd Phillips
Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Zazie Beets, and Robert De Niro.
5/5<br/><br/>I saw this film when it came out in theaters, feels kinda late after all these people saw it at the film festivals. I'm just gonna write this review now. This film was what I came in expecting. A gritty, gory (not that gory tbh) Martin Scorsese style movie (clearly to the likes of classics such as The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver), featuring Joaquin Phoenix as the second best on screen Joker - Heath Ledger is undefeated in my book. Joaquin definitely deserves an Oscar. The film was 2 hours, but my god, what a rollercoaster, it flew FAST! Similar to the Dark Knight trilogy, this was NOT a typical superhero/villain film. In fact it was anything but. You could look at this film and remove any Batman/Wayne/Joker details and it still feels like an intense movie focusing on a deeply depressed man. Wow. Just wow. I was speechless after watching it. "
2531," Joker is the best movie of 2019
"," I was in need for a movie like this and I didn't even know.
The theme is so pertinent and important and to all the people who fear this movie is going to incite violence, I think it's the other way. It teaches us we need to be more empathetic and pay more attention to the person next to us and how we, as a system, fail continuously to protect people.
Everything is perfect since Phoenix's performance (Ledger must be so proud) to the superb job of Todd Phillips, where every detail is thought and well-placed.
I highly recommend you to watch the movie but, most importantly, to think about it. "

", How can I describe joker it's a terrific film an a warm welcome for dc fans. It depicts joker in a different light showing him as more vulnerable an less of a threat. It shines a light in mental health an how it can deteriorate dramatically without help. All in a great film with some little teaser for future films. Can't wait too see where dc go from here. 
2537," Masterpiece
"," Acting was simply outstanding, Joaquin did an amazing job!!! Though the story didn't necessarily go anywhere, the performance made up for it! "
2538," Incredibly right.
"," Joaquin Phoenix acting is on point, he even goes beyond expectations. I'm thrilled his talent gets so much attention at last, he's good. No one else could have gone as deep in to the jokers mind as he did. Bravo "
2539," Zeitgeist
"," Joker is more than anything else a movie about loss, betrayal, loneliness and the strong humans need and desire to be loved and accepted. Joaquin portraits brilliantly a men who suffers from mental illness &amp; depression as well as rejection &amp; Isolation. Joker is not at all an action movie partly not even entertaining in the classic sense. There's no Happy End but more a reflection of our (current) society in almost every part of the world. If u are different u are out, if u think differently...out, look different ...out, etc. Perhaps it was long overdue to bring to the big screen and to a wider audience an exaggerated anti-hero who is vulnerable and lost. And aren't we all this at least occasionally? "
2540," Flawless Set Design
"," The SET DESIGN!!!! I am in love with the set and costumes. The script was awful, but it was a great take on Joker. Joaquin Phoenix was the PERFECT casting choice for Arthur and made me connect with Joker even more than I already did. "
2541," An acting and directing masterpiece
"," In my humble opinion, Joker is one of the best movies of 2019 and of the decade. This psychological thriller has clearly shown the transformation Arthur Fleck has gone through. All he wanted was to get accepted into the society, but the lack of this acceptance has gradually taken its toll on him and on his transformation into the Joker, what a journey he's been through. Superb and award-winning performance by Joaquin Phoenix coupled by amazing work on directing, cinematography and soundtrack. A must see! "
2542," The Clown Prince Of Crime Is Here!
", Joaquin Phoenix performs a brilliant role as Arthur Fleck and even better one as The Joker! 
2543," An Important Movie
"," A brilliant movie and a tour de force performance by Joaquin Pheonix. A movie that tackles important issues like: mental illness, loneliness, bullying and neglection from society.<br/><br/>We get to witness a Arthur's descent into madness, and ultimately becoming one of the greatest villians of all time.<br/><br/>A masterpiece of a movie. "
2544," An absolute masterpiece
", A work of art depicting a psychological study of the downward spiral of the human mind into self-indulgence and self-pity maximizing the ego through omnipotent alter-ego fantasies blaming society and beloved ones of oneself's uselessness to achieve goals and dreams masquerading this fragil futility onto psychological instabity and sickness. 
2545," Not the Typical Super Hero Movie
"," Check your optimism at the door, there is none here. The Joker parks itself at the corner of hopelessness and despair with no end to it in sight. Whatever seems positive will eventually be seen for a desperate illusion of reality. This is not the stereotypical and all too predictable super hero movie where there is a good guy and a bad guy who fight each other and eventually the good guy comes out on top in the end. It is not the stereotypical American film either, there is nothing optimistic about the movie nor is it realistic either, it's very pessimistic.<br/><br/>The movie is about a working clown's tragic life who works at a bad job and is afflicted with mental issues. At the same time he has to take care of his old lobotomized fragile mother in a run down apartment. He eventually has turn of luck that leads his already depressing life into something grim and dark. The Joker descends into a violent mad man as the movie progresses. But he is just not a mad man but a popular mad man that is considered iconic to many.<br/><br/>There is a tragic social/political world where all of this takes place. The entire atmosphere of Joker's life seems to provide this gritty merciless world where graffiti is on the walls of buildings and buses, the have nots are 'clowns,' and where there are snooty elites that perfume their noses while looking down on them. The working people end up identifying with the Joker's actions as a sign of anti-elitism. These people may view the Joker as an anti-elitist but his actions are far less refined and sophisticated, a bit nihilistic in fact. The Joker does things simply because he can, not out of vengeance.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is stands on its' own merits. His portrayal of a disturbed Joker was believable and tragic. We see a man who is relatively unhappy turn into a far more darker character. The Joker is still within the realm of Alan Moore's Joker from the ""Killing Joke."" The Joker is nihilistic, violent, and has very little reason to do what he is doing. He is violent, simply because he can be. There is nothing more to it.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips' directing is great. The music, the camera angles, the editing, and the necessary quiet subtleties of a movie that are often ignored were excellently done. There are hints of Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy which added some flavor to the film. The only part that felt weak was the plot.<br/><br/>I found myself at the end of the Joker asking what's the point of it all. I don't think the Joker knows neither does the viewer. His reasoning is simply because he felt like it. For me, this weakened the plot considering the Joker went through great lengths in order to unleash his madness.I didn't understand how was I supposed to feel at the end, it was just emptiness, I suppose that was the aim. Great film. "
2546," Wow! I have to see this again.
"," Joaquin Poenix's performance is out of this world. Great to see his interaction with Robert De Niro too.
If you're going to see one movie this year, this is it! "
2547," 'Be accepting and not judgmental on whom to accept'
"," In our methodical way of living, where we follow 'set norms' of living and endorse people who follow them as normal, there is no 'acceptance' of people who are different. Because different for us is 'abnormal'. Their existense is not realised. Then such people are propelled to protect themselves from the hostility of the so called 'normal'.
Joker is an intense story about a different man who has a disorder and a history of child abuse and torture. He is a victim of dejection and ignorance which makes him feel he is non existent. He is not heard by people and doesnt get the remedy to his predicament. He believes that he is born to spread joy and happiness but for all he is just a joker. He gets the recognotion and popularity after he ends up reciprocating a physical and emotional abuse through few murders. But then he ends up in a mental asylum.
Everyone is different but many of us wear a masquerade of societal masque to get accepted in the social group. We should be accepting and not judgemental about whom to accept!<br/><br/>VERDICT: A fabulous film elaborating the deplorable behaviour of society towards a man in need of help resulting in a catastrophe.
Jaoquin Phoenix has marvellously played the role . A flawless and applaudable film. "
2548," Vean La Pel√≠cula!! Amazing ! Extraordinary Acting, Writing and Directing

I can't miss this opportunity, I have to see this movie on the big screen again and again. I wanted to see the movie when the trailer came on just because I was curious and when the movie came out at some point I stop myself from seeing it because there was so much bandwagon of people talking about the movie. I don't regret seeing this movie I will never. One of the best movies in 2019 if not the best one. Stan Loona and BTS "
2549," Fantastic development story about the Joker
"," This movie is a fantastic film that gives a psychological analysis of how the Joker came about. It's not accurate to compare Ledger's Joker to Pheonix's given the different time periods and plotlines. Each cringe worthy, shocking moments, and grimaces are what this movie is about and gives an in depth revelation about who the Joker is as a person and his role as an iconic villain. "
2550," As good as everyone says
"," When Phoenix is on top of his game, he can truly embody a character. And that is definitely the case here. The level of haunting and disturbing is off the chart. I am going to be thinking about this one for awhile. "
2551," Unbelievable performance!!!
"," Such a strong and emotional movie!
Joaquin Phoenix gave a Mind-blowing Performance!
Everything was marvellous especially this combination of laughing with wet eyes was an impressive achievement!
Feelings, emotions and global messages!
It's a ""must"" for 2019 Movies..One of the best! "
2552," The Anti-Villain
"," Much has been written about how this movie draws upon 1970s-80s genre predecessors, so I'll spare mention of the obvious ones. What I saw draws heavily on ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (1947), right down to Phoenix's use of Danny Kaye's hand movements, except he forces them through the twisted bodily machinery of a madman.
The plot is mostly standard pathos: loss of the social safety net, uncertain parentage, social awkwardness, untreated mental illness, extreme physical bullying.
What makes it work for me is how each 'life' within Arthur's head is an unresolved dream brought on by the loss of access to 'medications': magnetic boyfriend? creepy stalker? failed entertainer? multiple murderer? overnight media sensation? dutiful son? matricidal maniac? socio-political cult sensation? It doesn't matter that any one of those fantasies is resolved, because Arthur is ultimately happy right where he was all along: in the asylum. The plot device of the 'case file' makes this clear.
How will fit Batman into this universe, where the villain isn't one and isn't a cartoon bent on corrupting or intoxicating minds, because he doesn't have to? We shall see. "
2553," OUTSTANDING PIECE OF ART
"," The movie just touched me as it represent the actual condition of many people and the reality. This where a mentally ill man is treated without the proper care, so... the outcome was more than obvious! "

2557," You are about to watch a oscar nomination movie

Since this has no spoilers, it's all I can tell. "
2558," A wake up call
"," This is a prodigious movie that, in essence, shows us how deeply troubled minds and psychopaths emerge out of families and societies that are more interested in looking to the sky, so to speak, than to the fellow that is next to them. J. Phoenix makes a wonderfull role, truly amazing and full of subtleties. An amazing job as well from Todd Phillips that will get all the Oscars. No wrong lines or scenes in this movie except perhaps the last ones that make the conection to the batman history. One doesn't need to know batman at all to fully enjoy this awsome movie that stands for itself among the glories of the american movies. "
2559," Amazing!
", It's been a while since a movie left me in such awe. Breathtaking performance by Joaquin and a storyline that explains how his character actually came to be. Not to mention the vivid cinematogtaphy and music. Strip down your expectations of the previous Joker perfomances and enjoy the ride. 
2560," Absolute must see, regardless of previous movie preferences
"," This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a film on IMDB. Joker is an absolute masterpiece. I believe it will be disected and discussed for decades to come.""<br/><br/>
Having seen joker 3 times now, I have finally concluded that it is one of the best films ever made. All aspects of the film (cinematography, score, acting, script, etc.) have excelled way more than I have ever seen in any film before.<br/><br/>I love that I can interpret the movie entirely different than someone else. I love the attention to detail. I love the insane deep intracacies of Arthur's mind.<br/><br/>There is so much to talk about, either within the mivie or yourself "

2562," A captivating Joaquin Phoenix
"," A dark, terrifying, brilliant, deeply disturbing and unforgettable movie with gorgeous visuals. The cinematography is bold and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating as Joker. I feel like Joaquin should get an Oscar nomination out of this, if not the win. The psychological journey of Arthur Fleck is interesting -especially for Criminology students- as Fleck's descent into madness and self-discovery as a villain is aggressive in its unpleasantness. The ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips won the challenge of making ""Joker"" and it works not only because it's completely different to the average comic book movie, but also because it's an impeccably acted and directed drama. nikisreviews.gr "
2563," The movie is so authentic!

First time ever to watch a realistic comic movie which made him a one of a kind.
The problem is this movie might encourage some evil things in our real world to whose see themselves in this movie in a way or another, the fact that the moments and situations you experienced in the joker might happened to you through your life, how many times you got a depressing situations where someone enjoys making fun of you or mocking your life, character, origin, religion, skin color. Ideology or even just bullying you in school. Let's think about that. Hurting someone's feeling is funny it can destroys everything "
2565," 1 of if not the best comic film in a long time
", I've been waiting for this film since it was 1st announced and I'm happy to say that it surpasses all of my expectations. Had to watch it twice to fully process everything. Joaquin Phoenixs' performance was just incredible. I didn't think he could come close to Heath Ledgers performance. Not saying he surpasses Ledgers performance or anything. But this interpretation of the clown prince of crime is an absolute joy to watch as you get to actually see how bad of a day he had to fully lose his mind. Expertly directed by Philips....a must watch. 
2566," A Minimalistic social horror movie
"," Todd Phillips ...directed the 3 Hangover movies and other mainly light movies...Joker is his first 'dark' movie...and he did it masterfully.
He wasnt shy from relying on the brilliant work of Joaquin ...the OST composer...and the cinematographer (who also mainly worked on comedies)...and together they made a movie that is truly a masterpiece in the sense of focusing on the 'unit', where every thing is kept simple.
A minimalistic movie where the clutter is removed, and one is forced to reflect inward and grasp the common pains and horrors that we have as people in our relentless modern society...bringing to life a character that resembles every isolated audience member in their own life story, where the weakness every one feels in their own life has a place in the movie and helps paint a darker picture than the one already presented minimalistically on the screen... creating a horror movie highlighting our personal fears of giving in to our madness and completely failing as social units of our societies. That is why I do not consider it a psychological horror movie where the person breaks down, but rather a sociological one where the institutes of society make sure the break down occurs, and break down themseleves in return. "
2567," Overall amazing film
"," I went to the Joker expecting for it to be a decent movie nothing great, but truthfully it was an outstanding movie. Joaquin plays him so incredibly well it's just really a work of art. I would 10/10 recommend seeing this movie if you at all like a violent thriller. "

2573," eerily effective with polarizing content
"," In the early 1980s Gotham City has deteriorated into an incendiary cesspool of crime and apathy where the rich and powerful have cast aside lower-class residents like Arthur Fleck, a party clown who's been disregarded his entire life. In spite of this he aspires to make it as a stand-up comedian, but his troubled history and mental erosion have begun to strip away what remains of his sanity. If you're looking to bring a well-known comic book character to the big screen in a way that's never been done before then look no further: this relentlessly dark and morbid story from Todd Phillips (yes, the same one from The Hangover series) is a psychologically twisted and unnerving character study of a frightening individual's downward spiral and just how far he'll go to make a name for himself. Intense, riveting, allegorical but equally audacious, chaotic and off-putting with a sluggish first half, how much actual enjoyment is derived from watching it is in the eye of the beholder, but there's no denying the work of Phoenix (with shades of Christian Bale) who dominates the screen with his unflinching portrait of the damaged protagonist...not for the faint of heart. **¬Ω "
2574," The most important film of this decade.
"," Joker answers a question any Batman fan will inevitably ask:<br/><br/>We have Bruce Wayne's history in Batman Begins (which was excellent) but what about his nemesis, the Joker? Here you have it, folks. And it pulls no punches in explaining how a deranged sociopathic serial killer comes to be.<br/><br/>Joker has a few laugh out loud moments, but for the most part it's a very dark, tragic tale of odds that are almost impossible to overcome and the inevitable consequences of isolation, loneliness, abuse... The very worst our world has to offer.<br/><br/>Joker won't rake in the big bucks at the box office. Rather, 50 years from now it will be talked about as the most culturally important film of this decade. "

In the Western world it is mostly bullying, in poorer countries suppression by other nations. Nobody cares for communities anymore. That's why we sympathize with he mad joker and it is amazing, that his story has finally been told to the fullest.

Besides the violence in the movie, they did make the viewer feel pity about the hard life that joker be in his life and think that what he had done wasn't entirely his fault.
Yet this is the 2019 best movies ever been made.
Congratss. "
2598," OUAAOU JOKER IS THE REALL HERO
"," A really good movie about a superhero ohh sorry super villain i mean ,the performance of Joaquin Phoenix overshadows all the others , great work from him,Gotham has great similarities with our world unemployment, poverty ,social inequality ,and the Joker in this general mess appears as a hero of the oppressed, and it really makes sense as he comes out of them, the joker certainly has great mental disorders but the oppression he receives amidst this unjust living community that eventually leads him to the Big Bang, who is the hero finally Batman or the Joker?

2611," Incredible
", This is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time. It takes a lot for me to concentrate through a whole movie and this had me gripped from start to finish. A background story with so much depth and a big and important focus on mental health and nurture 
2612," Cinematography at its finest
"," This film was an absolute masterpiece. The overall tone for the film dark and stayed like that throughout. It touches on very sensitive subjects in a way that makes it very real. Now wow the cinematography was so clever so beautiful and the soundtrack/score was absolutely fantastic, one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I've never walked out of the cinema in absolute awe of a film.<br/><br/>The fact that you wake up the next day still thinking about it and doing research on it just shows how much a film can leave an impact. This film finally brings life back to the cinema "
2613," Mesmerising
"," I was expecting a lousy remake as most of them have been over the past few years. I went into the movie theater cynical and skeptical but came out blown away. Outstanding performance, very detailed and well thought of scenery, etc.
You could not find a more unenthusiastic person to go watch this movie and it has completely won me over. "
2614," Intense, insane and incredible.
"," Amazing cinematic experience was Joker. A fresh mind, unknown to the comic books/movies would love this as well as big fans of the dc series. Everything from the score/soundtrack, cinematography, script and stand out alone method performance from Joaquin Phoenix is just insanely good. Love leaving a movie wanting to go straight back to see it. Todd Phillips changed the perspective of his work from comedy's like Hangover, Road Trip etc and released this beautiful picture, a true love of cinema and story telling was put into creating this film. Check it out, was a blast to watch!!! "
2615," This movie made me jizz my pants.
"," I have been following the movie industry in a pretty long time now and this was worth it all.
It was the ending that got me. How the joker was laughing at a ""joke"", and could not say it out loud because the person infront of him would'nt get it. This opens up to the mystery of the joker, as we do not know for certain what his origin story is, and maybe this movie is just one of the jokers many self-made origin stories.
10/10 - would watch again. "
2616," Deserves an Oscar
"," This movie is one of the best and most meaningful movies of 2019. It is excellently crafted, with a powerful ending that gives you goosebumps. Truly a film to be seen. "

2618," If You See Only 1 Film This Year.........This Is It.
"," From the moment the teaser feast our eyes you would never be mistaken to feel this movie could be almost pretentious. It couldn't be further from the truth. This hands down is a masterpiece. It's dark, mysterious and disturbing. It's brilliant and its down to the performance of one man..Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>It's unusual that a film that deals with the darkness of mental health issues makes you walk out with your mind blown, wanting more. This is because Phoenix takes you with him, deep in his conscience, you want to feel empathy, you cheer him.<br/><br/>This is not a normal DC superhero film. It's more anti-hero. There are no spoilers here, go out and enjoy and witness potentially what Oscar material is all about. "
2619," OMG
", It's such a good execution. That it's just insane.<br/><br/>That's how good it is 
2620," At last something thought provoking.
"," There's no chance I can sum this movie up fully here. All I can say is that in over 30 years of moviegoing the experience of watching this was so different than what has come before. It actually makes you think, its utterly disturbing but incredibly compelling. Phoenix is sensational but unflashy in a way I never felt a performance could be. See it break it down into its parts and then try and reconstruct it. Amazed and confused at the same time but my god what an experience. "

2623," Shocking and outstanding
"," I did not have high expectations for this film, the trailer did not convince me at all. I just wanted to give it a try. I mean all movies based on villains from comic books have been pretty much trash, and also superhero movies have been using the same old formula without taking new directions. However, this film can be watched by people that don't find interesting the genre. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix in portraying a person with mental illness and how a sick society that does not care for an average person can lead a person to commit crimes is outstanding. Highly recommended. "
2624," Utterly terrifying and deeply thrilling
"," I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but thought, I need to see what the buzz around this controversial film is.<br/><br/>To put it simply - I'm not sure the film is for the faint of heart. It is two hours of deep, soul destroying pain. You watch a man become destroyed mentally and physically. It can be hard to watch at times but that's what drew me in even more. The depiction of mental health may not be portrayed 100% accurately but JP does a damn good job of acting it. Even after the first few scenes I found myself rooting for this 'bad guy'. By the end I was questioning why I was backing a violent mob and a crazy clown but hey, it gives new light on films like The Dark Knight which I now need to watch again. "
2625," The Jokes on you now Deadpool!
"," The Clown Prince of crime has returned to the big screen in his very first, ground-breaking, solo movie! JOKER! Though anticipation is through the roof for this movie, can Joaquin Phoenix deliver us an uncanny performance enough to beat Heath Ledgers Joker of the Dark Knight Trilogy or equal him? All we know is, we need to review this film before we start laughing our heads off!<br/><br/>Plot
In a time before the Batman. Gotham City has become a corrupt, lawless hell on Earth. Our story follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian suffering from a mental illness that effects his emotional state. As Arthur's life continues to take a turn for the worse, he slowly descends into insanity which eventually leads him into becoming Gotham City's most feared criminal of all time. The Joker.<br/><br/>Likes
The Joker is portrayed as a dark, classic, psychological style thriller with themes inspired by a 1970's society. It blends the superhero genre and elements of classic crime films and noir style storytelling. And the cinematography and camerawork is impressive and captivating within its themes.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and extraordinarily well written. Even from the first act of the film you are left at the edge of your seat in awe as the story occurs which in a way is portrayed so differently, that it makes it very unpredictable to know what happens next. And in this day and age of Superhero films, different is better.
Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker is the best thing about this movie and even his performance itself makes it clear why this film exists. His take on the Joker is original and fresh without any inspiration from Joker actor previous. Not only does Phoenix Joker give us a fully developed, fleshed out look into his origins, but also defines the ruthless nature and injustice that made him what he is today. Just seeing how his previous life in Gotham has been tragic for him every day and learning of the trauma he had as a child makes you feel pity for him having suffered so endlessly from bullying and rejection. Making you think just how small your issues really are in comparison to himself. I even have to admit that Phoenix portrays the character so well that he even makes the Joker sound like a real-life person.
Which is clearly enough to rival even Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. And it's also safe to say that he is 100 times better than Jared Leto's dull and crappy portrayal of the Joker from Suicide Squad. Unlike him, Joaquin Phoenix portrays the Joker accurately to his Personality and his appearance.
Also loved some of the nods that this film throws around in the story. Such as The Jokers past taking some inspiration from Alan Moores The Killing Joke. And also having Bruce Wayne and his parents feature as a plot point in the movie (And not forgetting his parent's deaths which would result in his transformation into Batman). Even if Todd didn't read that many comics during production. He certainly didn't forget the most important references within the lore.<br/><br/>Dislikes
Now, for some reason the Joker has been causing recent controversy in the media for its glorified violence and allusion that it would inspire people to become Mass Shooters. Well... The Joker only shoots 4 people in this movie (three even in self-defence) and kills the other 4 unarmed so how is all that bad compared to character body counts in other movies? But since this controversy is obviously pointless to list here, I'll just go with my own non-political criticisms.
Now there are aspects of the Jokers story that does leave more questions than answers. Like, whatever happened to the romantic sub-plot between Arthur and his estranged girlfriend (Zazie Beets)? At first they were going somewhere with it then all of a sudden the plot just disappears halfway through the movie and she is never mentioned or seen again.
Why did Arthur kill one of his former co-workers for? Sure he may have been a jerk to him but he did have respect for him and wanted to help out.
Spoiler Warning!: Since Arthur is already Identified as the subway killer earlier in the movie by the police, shouldn't that mean Jokers identity is pretty much exposed since he killed Robert De Niro live on TV and started riots? But I feel the plot just ignores it saying ""Nah, he's too much of a loser for the city to even know him."" Still realistically in a world of Television, Forensic scientists and detectives, his identity would be as good as revealed soon after.
Lastly, it didn't really portray the definition of Mental Illness that well like I hoped it would. Like, Arthur strives to do his best in life with what he gets, but he seems to treat his growing mental collapse as if it is incurable. That is wrong. People can in-fact fight back against it and some have even managed to find the right help so as to be able to control it and perhaps even cure it. But that seems to be the exact opposite of what this film's moral indicates. I'm autistic and I have lots of problems. But the last thing I would want is to kill innocent people just because I didn't put enough effort in restraint. But I guess Arthur Fleck is just as human as everyone else I suppose.<br/><br/>Verdict?
Just when you thought Deadpool was the undisputed R-Rated Superhero film of all time. The Joker may have just knocked the Merc with the Mouth off of his Perch. Though it can't help being controversial to many with its violence and subliminal message, Joker offers every Batman fan a chance to experience the clown prince of crimes story first hand in the most imaginative way possible. Offering an original twist with thrilling moments of suspense, drama and dark comedy that the Joker himself has become well known for. Right or Wrong, The Joker is a crazy good time that might even have the Oscars turning their heads this year.
I give Joker an 8/10. "
2626," Great movie
"," Great movie, exceptional joker performance and dont understand how some people dont appreciate this great masterpiece. "
2627," Movie of the year?
"," At first I had some doubts about this movie fulfilling high expectations that were put around it, but after I saw it all distrust that I had before transformed into joy and amazement. It shows perfectly well how can society's mistreated individuals destroy the system that poisoned their being. A picture that displays so exceptionally the story that drives it, really does deserve your attention. "
2628," Gloomy social criticism, relentlessly bleak, brutal with an outstanding Joaquin Phoenix
"," Joaquin Phoenix is just awesome and delivers one of his best ever performances. But I was shocked how skinny he became in this movie.<br/><br/>Don't expect a special effects fantasy.
This is a movie about a free fall of humanity.
Cruel, brutal, dark underlined with an excellent Soundtrack.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect example how monsters were created and personalities were destroyed. "
2629," A great and unnerving story powered by Joaquin Phoenix's flawless performance.
",
2630," Movie + Soundtrack = Best
"," One of the best. Would it compete with top rank of ""imdb top 250 of all time""?
And also, the soundtrack is top notch too! "
2631," Great Movie!
"," This dark movie sets the bar for DC very high. It is a hard movie to describe without spoiling but I will try my best.<br/><br/>One of the main things this movie achieves is tone. The tone perfectly shows our main characters struggles and challenges which led him to madness. It goes from funny and unnerving to sad and sympathetic while still keeping a coherent story. It doesn't dwell on scenes to long and it shows the audience just the right amount to keep them engaged. The acting was good throughout The Whole film and it felt like real people talking and not actors.<br/><br/>One of the main problems I had with it was a sorta day dream sequence. It felt out of place and they could have presented the same information in a more interesting and creative way. It wasn't that big of a problem, I just thought is was a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>All in all, great film. "
2632," A brilliant masterpiece, but I understand why it's difficult to watch.
",
2633," Had to see it twice due to the brilliance of the entire thing.
"," Wow. Believe it or not, it was even better the second time i saw it, because i knew the story and could look for things. I thought I would be able to better understand what is 'real', and what is not the second time, however the writing is so brilliant that you just do not know. We have not seen many movies like this over the past 20 years, and this will be iconic for a long time. Possibly the movie of the generation. I cannot support this film enough. It should win pretty much every major oscar award, including score of all things. Simply wow. "
2634," Masterpiece
"," What a movie, Joaquin Phoenix is perfect, pictures are truly amazing and the atmosphere is terrifying. The best movie I've seen since years. "
2635," No jokes here
", Well that was grim. Joaquin Phoenix has to be a shoo in for the Oscar. A riveting totally believable depiction of someone suffering mental illness. A great soundtrack and cinematography. As far removed from Todd Phillips previous work as it possibly could. The last hour is absolutely gripping but be prepared for no laughs. You wouldn't want to be in bad form going to see this. There's nods to King of Comedy and the Batman story but in reality this is very accurate depiction of how people with mental health issues are treated and it's not a pretty picture. Not the best movie I've ever seen but Phoenix's performance is up there with the best. 
2636," Uncomfortable viewing
"," The unique perspective causes you to feel quite empathetic for a character capable of great evil.
Minus one star because the clown makeup was applied a little too heavily in the final scenes of the movie, obfuscating the actors face. I found some of the amazing facial expression from earlier in the film was lost. "
2637," A 2-hour painful journey which is enjoyable and you can understand
", I think it was the best movie i have seen in 2019 till now. Best performances from actors and a script with smooth speed so you can feel everything inside the movie. It's not like other comic books with super powers and there is no strange special effect in the movie. In my opinion it was the purest Joker character I have ever seen my whole life and from now on we can respect Jokers because they were in severe pain and in the movie you can feel the pain with each of your cells. Some people say it is a violent movie but it is a necessary part of movies that use exaggeration to learn us something and not leading us to violence but lead us to reason. I was satisfied with the movie and all of its items. 
2638," The joke was on me.
"," Firstly I want to say that this was a masterpiece all round. The cast, crew and director have made such an incredible movie.<br/><br/>Secondly if you're going to watch this movie because it's the Joker a villain of Batman and you think that they will end up fighting then it's not for you. Joker is more of a phscological thriller than a superhero movie. In this film you have to play close attention so you can grasp the concept. I think a bit of Joker knowledge will help you understand what you have just watched.<br/><br/>Thirdly I believe that the point of the movie is to make us question every last little bit and try an figure out what it is we have just watched. Was it all a dream? Was half real and half fake? The questions go on.<br/><br/>I personally believe that in this movie it all plays out the way we see apart from the ending. We know that Arthur fantasies and creates his own story so I believe after he kills Murray he is taken away, Gotham is on the brink of chaos and he sees this and revels in it. But he doesn't get rescued, Arthur invents this part. The truth is he's arrested and taken away to Arkham Asylum (Or the movies version of Arkham) I could be wrong but the hair dye doesn't look like the type that would be in your hair a while it only looked like the ones that go after a few washes. So when he arrives at Arkham they will wash him and take away his make up, I think to take away his power of being Joker.<br/><br/>When he tells his psychiatrist that she wouldnt get the joke that he was laughing at. I believe the joke was referencing the choas that would follow what he has done and then he kills her so everyone fears him more.<br/><br/>This is all my take and you can take what you want. I will also be interested in what you have to say about the movie.. "

2641," It's not a movie, it's a fucking piece of art
"," One of the best movies I have ever seen. We'll be remembering joker for this movie now, and not for the dark knight "
2642," Not the actual origin story but worth while
"," I don't think this is the actual origin story of the Joker, but nonetheless I liked the movie. I am not a critic but if I have to summarize this movie, I would just call it ""One person's Descent to Madness"". Even if the protagonist(antagonist) wasn't Joker and was just a random John Doe, it would still be a good movie to watch. But this movie is not meant for everyone, and I wholeheartedly understand that. Some of the part may be cliched and similar to some other movies, but I still enjoyed watching this movie. "
2643," Joker Is Good. Phoenix is Amazing.
",
2644," Amazing
"," The directing, score, cinematography, and acting was phenomenal in this movie, while I don't think it's the best movie ever made it definitely deserves its praise as it will go down as a classic. "
2645," Just an amazing work of art. it almost makes me forget about Heath Ledger ;)
"," I' am not going to do a review, please take my advice and enjoy the movie. "
2646," It's real
"," The whole movie you feel feelings, is a movie that you connect from the beginning. Before watching the movie, I read many headlines that read ""A movie that incites hate."" However, the real reason is a reflection of the burlesque society of which many of us have taken part. "
2647," Joaquin Phoenix was AMAZING!!
", I went into this film with expectations for what I wanted to see from Joker and I was NOT disappointed! Joaquin Phoenix took my breath away with his portrayal of Joker. I was absolutely riveted watching his descent into darkness. Heath Ledger would be proud to see how Joaquin Phoenix hit the bar that was set with Ledger's performance and made this character his own. 
2648," The Smile- Project-MD
"," Walking into this film I didn't know much about the story or the actor, I had hear great things about Joaquin Phoenix and his movies but I had never experienced it. I was told countless times there would be incredible amounts of violence and when I walked in he barely killed or hurt anyone. Although you only see five deaths six are implied, but the most damage was to himself and the psychological doing the world had done to him. I had felt a deep sorrow for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) because it shows society failing as a unit. The was no one helped him, he felt alone and trapped, doctors were failing, his mother was crazy, and no one bothered to care. Joker had started a revolution without saying a word. As a viewer we are told not to feel remorse or sympathy for any villain because it is their choosing this was not the case, no wonder a man went insane. The way Joaquin Phoenix presented himself was incredible 10/10. The story line really showed the darkness of the world and the crazy 10/10. This movies was incredible I recommend it to anyone and everyone. A good movie for me gives me a connection and I felt this throughout the entire film. "
2649," Just saw it today, gonna go see it again tomorrow
"," LOVE the theme of this movie - mental illness, with a side of ""kill the rich."" The violence might be a little hard for some to watch, but it's only a few scenes and the violence is pretty brief.<br/><br/>Seriously, just give Juaquin ALL THE AWARDS - what an amazing performance. Interesting that the critics are 50/50 on this and the actual audience is loving it. "
2650," Beautiful movie.
"," Really a masterpiece especially if you look at it beyond the surface level. It is beautifully disturbing and violent, and Joaquin put on a spectacular performance in this version of Joker. Definitely will be winning awards. "
2651," A Masterpiece
"," There are parts of this movie that are actually uncomfortable to watch and it's unflinching reality is what makes it so special. It is the performance of Pheonix's career and the highest achievement by Phillips to date. It also happens to be my personal favourite thing done with the Batman mythos since Ledger's Joker. I hope Warner Bros. has the balls to keep allowing Phillips to continue making movies in this universe. Of course, the ending does complicate things. "
2652," 10/10
", Possibly the best movie I've seen. A perfect representation of how you'd imagine a character such as the joker to be imagined on the big screen. Also deals with a lot of real world issues and leaves you thinking of how things are. I've seen this movie in theatres two times in theatres and was left with the same feelings both times. Joaquin Phoenix did a truly magnificent job. 
2653," The storyline is mind blowing
"," I got to see this movie mid-day with my girl and we were curious how Joaquin Phoenix would deliver such a pivotal role, and he didnt disappoint. The director won our vote hands downs, best movie of the year. "
2654," It's not a comic book movie
"," This is more of a psychological movie than a comic book movie, it's so deep it may bore you. This movie does not romanticize violence or killing but rather, it reminds us why we should always be kind and have empathy to other people. Why we should never be the reason a good person would resort to violence and madness.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 ‚ú®<br/><br/>You should see how Joaquin Phoenix transform from Arthur to being the Joker to becoming a symbol. "
2655," THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE
"," So good in so many different ways!! This movie tells us about someone who can't fit in, it's a critic to society who can't accept the ones that are different, this is a very important subject on the 21st century! But let's talk about the important part in here: Phoenix's performance! MEMORABLE that's all I can say, if this guy doesn't win as Oscar for this one, I don't know who will! Such an incredible and different movie should and probably will have a huge recognition! Thanks Todd Phillips for this huge MASTERPIECE! "
2656," This is an excellent film
", This film is a wonderful gripping intense experience and you just have to see it I can't do it justice. 
2657," Very Well Done!
", It was very well written and dives deep into the psychological aspect of how a killer is formed in the real world. It is very harrowing as well and made me feel some sympathy for the Joker as well. The movie also speaks to the awful realities of society and how they can change a person. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job playing this role and captured the character very well. 
2658," Knock, Knock
"," A movie of a lifetime!
Great in every aspect.
This is the kind of art we don't normally dare to enjoy.
Joaquin Phoenix shows us a society toxic enough to bring a clown all the way up to a King of chaos.
Its a movie about lack of love, empathy, humanism, and understanding.
Its a trip to the other side of madness. "
2659," What an amazing movie !
", Easily one of (if not) the best movie of the decade ! 
2660," Give this man an Oscar!

2661," people who put 10 get the movie

2662," ICONIC
"," I have no words, It's just been a while since I watched such a quality movie. "
2663," Expectations
"," I saw nothing about this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't watch trailers, didn't look at posters and didn't listen anybody's expectations.<br/><br/>I wanted to see and review this within my perspective, and I am glad I did that.<br/><br/>This movie isn't about boxoffice, people's expectations or fame. It's about changing the idea of latest ""blockbuster"" movies. In every part and every frame of this movie, you can see a reform movement. Within Joker's rivalry against society and it's standarts, you can see people's hatred upon hollywood.<br/><br/>As i saw in the last six days, there is now a hope because of this movie. Because it has exceeded our expectations. It has broke the law of being boring, and amused us. Even this makes this movie a miracle, a masterpiece, and it deserves to be watched. "
2664," Ending Explained. The truth about the final scene!
"," This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made. Everything about the movie is fantastic. The acting, the plot, the twists, the music, you name it... But the most important thing, the ending, is something Spectacular!<br/><br/>In the final scene when Arthur is speaking with his psychiatrist he is in a mental asylum and his hair and beard are GREY, a sign of this being about 15-30 years later. When speaking with his psychiatrist, Arthur suddenly starts to laugh, but only this time, his laugh is very different from the laugh throughout the movie. This laugh seems a lot more ""genuine"". Arthur is having a flashback to the time when he was free. Then the psychiatrist asks him, what is so funny? Arthur then gets a new flashback, this time, of Bruce Wayne standing beside his dead parents during the riot caused by the joker. Then Arthur says ""You wouln't get the joke"". Since Arthur now has grey hair, this is some years later. During these, lets say, 20 years, Bruce Wayne has become Batman and got his revenge on the joker, who was the reason for his parents' death. Arthur finds this funny because of the irony. Arthur starting a riot, leading to the death of Bruce's parents, Bruce coming back, 20 years later, and locking Arthur inside the asylum. Arthur doesn't only find this funny, he also gets very angry and upset, which is why he kills his psychiatrist in the end. He is angry that his actions fired back at him and caused him to be locked up in a mental asylum for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>The joke all along, and the reason for Arthur calling his life ""a comedy"", is that HE CREATED the BATMAN.<br/><br/>Thank you. "
2665," A hard hitting home run of a film
", This movie blew me away. I walking in with massive expectations and walked out feeling they had all been destroyed. This movie is brilliant go and see it and digest it's beauty! 
2666," Is it better than the dark knight?
"," Even though I knew about this film I never got that excited about it beforehand. That being said, I did end up seeing this at the opening weekend so maybe still a but of a fanboy!<br/><br/>What can I say more than, at the end of the film I wanted to clap and shout about what an amazing film it was. Oscar worthy Joaquin, DeNeiro popping up in any film is a bonus. Cinematic gold, no CGI, no epic settings, no cast of millions...just an amazing story well told and acted!<br/><br/>If you only see one film this year, than see this one. "
2667," A compelling & mind-blowing portrayal of the Joker
"," Phoenix does justice to the Joker with his every bit of emotion, movement, and delivery of dialogues - hands down an amazing performance. Arthur's journey will engross the viewer, pushing them to encounter a devastating mix of emotions. "
2668," This is How you should have a villain protagonist in a movie
"," I went into this movie with a suspicion that it was just another overhyped anti-hero movie. It isn't. Joker portrays a realistic ( sometimes even disturbingly so ) fall into depression and insanity leading to a murdering phycopath. Now a lot of people have been siting this as a problem saying "" it makes you sympathise with murderer "" when in actuality it makes you empathize with one. It shows you why and how someone could do this but at the end of the day you know that he's wrong. By doing this it elavates itself above other "" villain "" stories because it's not restricted to making the protagonist a good guy deep down. This movie is a warning to society to not treat people less fortunate as you terribly or this is what they'd become. And the joker's performance really sells how unhappy and crazy he is. And most of all this movie is disturbing. As I mentioned before it's realistic which makes this movie scary in a way that no horror could rival. My only real issue with the movie is that it's very aimless at points and feels as if there's no goal but still this is a great movie to rival the dark knight. "
2669," Masterpiece
"," It has been long since I get moved by a movie this much, I came back home sad I don't know why, still can't get over it. How many humans lived such rough childhood and then get rejected by society and then we blame them for being weird, it is really sad, people should think about each-other much more "
2670," Best Joker ever.
"," Before I saw the movie I saw the bad reviews by self-proclaimed movie critics but i still wanted to give it a shot and I am so glad that I did. The narrative has great depth as well as the actors, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The music and sceneries fit so well that it catapults you right into the time and place. There's so much I could say about this movie but I don't wanna spoil anything.<br/><br/>This movie has once again proven how important it is to find things out for yourself and not listen to others, especially not critics who's job is to create awareness for their publication. I truly hope Joker will continue with this cast and formula.<br/><br/>10/10 for Joker. "
2671," Brilliance, Artistic, Spectacular
"," From Phoenix's brilliant performance to the story itself, this movie delivers an astonishing dark origin tale of one of the most infamous villains in comic book history. It will make you laugh, perhaps cry, feel sorry and pain, anger and accomplishment as it is one of the BEST movies in cinema history. Personally I didn't have much expectations to avoid disappointment, but this movie succeeded in catching my attention and love from beginning to end. I watched it the day it came out and I'm still amazed by how it touched me. Heath is surely proud of Phoenix's role watching from up there. Go and watch this every penny worthy movie, it's pure art. "
2672," Yes, an absolute yes!
"," Finally, a movie which is worth writing a review for. Not a regular action movie with a villian-type of main role. It is an astonishing, stylish and very dark story of a man becoming the Joker. The environment, the music, the actors, everything just felt as a unity. Bravo! "

"," If you want an origin story from the DC world, then you have to see this film. It is not an action packed adventure like batman, but a story of a man who lives in a world that is unjust, unforgiving and toxic.
The music score throughout helps the intensity of the story and Mr Phoenix's portrayal and character development really is astounding.
Will have to watch it again to get my head around the storyline some more. "
2676," Who of us not wanna be a joker to oppression and injustice.
"," JOKER, This is why I love acting, however if you are in a bad mood stay away from this movie. The movie is deeply confusing and dark. Touching your heart confusing your mind. Outstanding performance facial expression body language by Joaquin Phoenix the music is increidable making you stick to your chair. Who of us not wanna be a joker to Oppression and injustice. Phoenix show us how to become a joker but Heath ledger show us what joker do, so it is unfair to compare between the two legends. Wanna see it again one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. "

"," People who rate low for this movie, don't appreciate the concept of how dark the Gotham city is and what acting heavy mean. On the other hand avengers end game was so mediocre in creating visual effects from previous movie and using time machine to defeat evil ( plain stupid) and yes about the rating check out people's profile who rated low for this movie, 10 on 10 for avengers and spider man home coming.

2682," Absolutely Marvellous Acting By JP!!
"," This movie is nothing about hero..
Its about an innocent man becoming a psychopath!
And they delivered it most convincing way!
From start to finish.. You will feel what's really going on!
Kudos to the Director,cinematographer, music composer, script writer and the one who pulled of the Marvellous Acting........JOAQUIN PHOENIX!!
Hope there is a sequel following what happens after that!! "
2683," All I have are positive thoughts about this movie
"," Brilliant movie with very intriguing plot twists. The first 20 minutes were enough to judge Joaquin Phoenix who did a phenomenal job as the Joker. His body transformation, looks, laugh, dance moves all summed up to make a massive combo which took the movie to a whole new level of excellence . Overall it was a masterpiece.
Ledger would be proud! "
2684," Consider this could be someone's real life
"," No superheroes, no flying people, no aliens! Just a poor human with its mind, soul and body. That can be any of us, that can happen in any of the cities, that can be anyone's life. People from the shadow got their 5 minutes in this movie for all of us to see how World can be dark and miserable place. That happen when people forget to be humans and to care for each other in the first place.
This is Psycho of the 21st century. "
2685," Not suitable for critics, suitable for everyone else.
"," Please don't listen to the people and some critics who says they the movie is promoting violence. This is an entirely wrong opinion (if you have more than one brain cell). E.g. apart from that in the Time Magazine I also found out that it also includes whitewashing, too much borrowing from Scorcese and, OMG, 'not the best acting'! All is completely untrue which the user's rating prooves. Behind quite a low metacritic score I only see that a lot of elite media regards the movie as 'not politically correct' and they are totally forgetting that so is our world that we live in. So please enjoy one of the strongest and most beautiful pieces of art in years! "
2686," The best movie
", The best MOVIE I've seen in yearsüî•üî•I'll see it again 
2687," Don't listen to the media, this movie is wonderful
"," Although Arthur Fleck had a sick sense of humor that was often times off putting, yet the biggest joke of all related to the film is the media and metacritic coverage. Shock journalism has done a massive disservice to Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips and the rest of the crew that created this wonderful film about a man that just could not get a break, and eventually broke himself.
Very reminiscent of the Taxi Driver, but much more a product of current times, Joker has a dark message to share about the instability and cruelty of our modern society while at the same time serving as a great character study and origin story for this infamous villain. "
2688," amazing film
", Such an amazing character study. great cinematography. the score is eerie yet beautiful and phoenix performance is Oscar worthy 
2689," On par with Heath Ledger's iconic role in Dark Knight.
"," I was blown away by the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix. As the movie moves forward you start to emerge in the movie, more and more every second. The movie tries to get you really interested in the tragedy of Arthur Fleck likes it's smoothly going up like a roller coaster but when it hits, it hits like a car crash you are completely devastated by shocks and thrills that are delivered by the movie. I never thought that anyone would be able to portray the character of Joker as finely did by Heath Ledger but Man o Man this is just a complete another level. The movie has dark humor, it is tragic but it makes your ideology struggle for if what Arthur did was right or wrong. If you haven't watched this movie you are missing a milestone of acting set by Joaquin Phoenix. This movie is another level of awesome at another level of darkness. If you thought Joker was twisted you will come to know in this movie that people are more twisted. Truly a masterpiece. "
2690," An afterthought from the time Hollywood still made truly great films
"," I normally would cringe at the thought of giving any film a 10 rating, no movie is perfect and I guess this isn't either, but for me I suppose this gets pushed from a 9 to a 10 just for being the type of film that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore.<br/><br/>This movie takes one of comic's most famous mad clowns and takes you with him on the soul destroying journey of how he became Joker. Don't listen to the online loonies, this movie won't make you attack anyone, it will however make you think about mental illness and the people who suffer in silence. As well as the general, but basic, concept of kindness to others.<br/><br/>On this journey, though you often vehemently disagree with joker's actions, you're nonetheless compelled to understand those choices. Phoenix and Phillips don't just deserve Oscars for this, what they've created essentially amounts to a treatise on the more tragic side of the human condition "
2691," I loathe superhero films but........
"," This was absolutely jaw dropping. If JP doesn't get best actor for this then the Oscars should be permanently disregarded as an absolute farce. Unlike 99.99% of mainstream films this was intelligent, is multi layered and has bucket loads to think about.. credit should be given to Warner bros for not issuing Deadpool part 26 and taking a chance on something extremely dark and very challenging for a mainstream audience. If anyone likes this, check out a documentary called Hail Satan? , which has a similar theme of examining 'otherness'. The best mainstream film of the decade for me. "
2692," What a performance! 5 days later and I'm still thinking about it.
",
2693," Shocking!!!
", Speechless. 
2694," Send in the Clown
"," This is what I was expecting. Not a lot of people would appreciate Joker but in of its glory Joker talks about how cruel society has become in this day and age. Mental Illness is a serious concern and we as a society need to tackle it headon. Issues like Child Abuse, Mental Illness, Murder and Criminal Prejudice are the core of this movie. Anyone who goes in expecting a comic book movie is mistaken. You can't compare Joker to any other CBM it's a depiction of the character in real life. It's one of those rare stories where the villain wins and we see it from his perspective. "
2695," A perfect origin to a perfect villain
"," I dont understand the hate. I was very excited for this movie, then I read some reviews saying that it isnt actually good. But why? I saw one review where s/he literally wrote that s/he wanted to see a villain killing for no reason. Is that how a story works? If someone is a psycho. There has to be some reason and proper explanation about what he is doing or why he is doing. Killing people without any reason doesnt bring any character arc to the character. I think Phoenix nailed it as the Joker. His acting was perfect. If we talk about Cinematography, then its pretty notched up. The violence and action in this movie isnt high like any other superhero movie. But I think thats what make this movie more realistic and relatable to the real world. I am a die hard marvel fan, and I loved this movie. Music score is top notched, you would have heard it in the teaser trailer. His laughs really shows someone with suffering nd pain. The best thing I observe about this movie is that its well placed. The scenes have been deleted and cut in a proper manner, to give the exact runtime that a plot like this should have. It just didnt feel stretched. I lob "
2696," Delivers Exactly What It Promises
"," If you didn't like this movie, it wasn't for you. If you did like this movie, you almost definitely loved it. It seems more people fall into the latter category.<br/><br/>As director Todd Phillips said on stage before the TIFF screening, ""It's a slow burn, but it's worth it"". Indeed it is!<br/><br/>I could go into the plot but no one wants to hear that before seeing a movie. I will say this much, it will give you chills and goose bumps when it's moment arrives.<br/><br/>Watch this movie. There's a better than 50% chance you'll love it. "
2697," DC done right!
"," DC is back and better. Gritty, dark, depressing! Omg I can't say enough, I didn't believe the hype because people typically are stupid but after seeing people bash the movie for being too dark, I knew it was my kind of movie. I could feel the anguish and laughed when I wasn't supposed to. Joaquin has always been a phenomenal actor but he truly shone in this movie, yes give the man his Oscar! I need more of these movies ASAP. "
2698," great movie
"," Best DC movie I ever seen.This movie has no stunts, but it is even more shocking. "
2699," Joker the existentialist superhero
"," The movie is amazing, acting is superb, no childish action or CGI superhero nonsense. It's pure acting and pure cinema. Joaquin Phoenix should get an Oscar for this.<br/><br/>Everyone is comparing it to Heath Ledger's Joker, I don't think it's comparable. I mean it's the same character but that is all, it ends there, this is much deeper and much more serious, we should compare it to Taxi Driver with Robert De Niro who also plays here (was that intentional?). Joker is a 150 years old character, he's the Underground Man and the he was created by Dostoevsky. Watch it. "
2700," FLAWLESS
"," Joaquin reis nailed it. It was unbelievable, and I would laugh at it if someone said to me that you would cry in this film. "
2701," Amazing act - amazing movie!!
"," Mr. Phoenix's performance is outstanding.
A movie with a deep message!
Hopefully he will be nominates for Oscar!

2702," No laughing matter
"," Plot; A disturbed man adrift in the miasma of a dying city finally snaps and he proves to be the match to its gasoline.<br/><br/>The Joker is, without much debate, the most iconic and beloved comic book villain of all-time. Through the years, there have been several rather diverse interpretations of the character, but I dare say there hasn't been one like this.<br/><br/>Joker plays like an homage to Scorsese's Taxi Driver w/a splash of his King of Comedy thrown in for good measure. Drowning in the zeitgeist of early 80s New York (Gotham here, but we all know Gotham has always served as an avatar for the Big Apple), the atmosphere alone feels like you're wearing a soaking wet overcoat. And then we meet Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). He's a man hanging by his very last string whose grip on sanity is a fragile house of cards. You're just marking time until he snaps, but that's not to say the wait is uninteresting. Exactly the opposite. Phoenix is mesmerizing. Watching him here is to see the difference between an actor and an artist.<br/><br/>I'll leave interpretation of its themes to the viewer, as it's likely to differ from person to person. That says a lot about how subtly deep this film is.<br/><br/>We live in the golden era of the comic book movie. At some point it'll end, won't it? We'll get burned out of watching grown people in costumes or the quality will sag. But right now, at this moment, it's a rich and surprisingly diverse tapestry and the real joke is on the movie snobs who refuse to admit it. "
2703," Joaquin Phoenix is amazing
", Excellent performance accompanied by stellar storytelling. 
2704," Awesome movie
", Really good movie and btw people are so pathetic and miserable. Just read all the low rating comments lmao 
2705," JOAQUIN PHEONIX PERFORMANCE ALONE IS 10/10

2706," Mesmerizing
", What a performance by Joaquin Phoenix!! What a direction by Todd Phillips!! What an amazing Origin Story! The movie lived to the Hype! This is the Joker that will be remembered for years to come! 
2707," Reminds me of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky
"," The movie shows how a neglected common man becomes a criminal for the sake of justice. His way of doing it is through the way of chaos.<br/><br/>Though the story connects a lot of dots with the Batman story, but still some things felt as if they were molded to fit the narrative. But overall great watch, the mood, the cinematography, acting, score are all marvelous. "
2708," Wonderstruck!
"," Heath Ledger's Joker was a monument that embodied the character in a such a way that no other actor could ever dare to accomplish. Now, 11 years later we have an equator to that epic portrayal of the character in the name of Joaquin Phoenix. Believe it when I say.... The walk, the posture, the cold stare, it's all back on the big screen. Joaquin Phoenix brings the clown prince to life in such a way that viewers will have to think twice before blinking. Coming from Director Todd Phillips, *Joker* takes you on a trip to the Humane side of the character, something that no other Joker movie has ever done. *Joker* is the best comic book movie since *The Dark Knight* and one of the finest portrayals of *one man's descent into maddness*. Academy Awards 2020 will be a war between legends. Joaquin Phoenix vs Leonardo DiCaprio and hopefully Robert DeNiro. If you haven't watched Joker yet, then get movin' "

2710," What did I just saw?
"," After seeing this movie, I was totally blank! I kept asking myself ""What did I just watch?"" Acting, direction, and man...! The sound track! It's very very depressing and suits the flow of the theme. This movie is perfect adaption of the DC's most dangerous villain ~ Joker! And I must say JP should mr nominated for oscars! Best DC movie that I have ever seen! Thanks Todd Philips for this amazing gift! "
2711," Really Solid
"," I, personally, really enjoyed this film. There are a few mild pacing issues in the middle of the movie, and some of the stuff they shoehorn in as far as Gotham references weren't entirely needed, but I do think that Joaquin's acting and especially the themes make this film worth watching. The last fifteen minutes of this movie just really come together to form a glorious marriage of madness, mayhem, and meaningful messages. "
2712," Oscar for Phoenix
"," Hmmm, initially I wanted to give it a nine for how Phoenix's acting really gripped me throughout the movie. But considering how it turned the movie into a one-man show I must think twice, and here it goes ...... an eight! "
2713," Heartbreaking and Disturbing at the same time
"," Within the first few minutes you can't help but feel empathy for Arthur, it's heartbreaking to watch the world be so cruel to him and for him to not fit anywhere. The movie takes you on a journey of feeling sad then to feeling disturbed as Arthur devolves into Joker. At the beginning of the movie he states he did best in hospital care, which is where he should've stayed. This is a movie about how society turns its back on people with mental illness and disabilities, giving them no place in this world and making them feel alone and isolated, which is absolutely heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and he deserves to win an award for his performance. If you don't want to watch some of the disturbing stuff, you can cover your eyes like I did, it's pretty obvious when it's about to happen so you can look away if prefer. "

For the majority of the movie I had tears in my eyes for the sympathy that I felt for Arthur Fleck, it was a completely new approach to the Joker and I have to say I felt things that I never thought I would feel for the character. Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves the highest of praise for this genius performance, I found him heartbreaking and was overcome with emotion throughout the movie. I don't think that anyone else could have portrayed the character in such an amazing way. An absolute work of art. "

2742," Disease as Superficial Power
"," This movie dramatizes the sad story of Arthur's mental anguish in which he asks people to call him Joker. He was the victim of abuse in his family, in his employment, and his intimate relationships. He was aware of personal health issues, but he was persistently trying to use his mental problems to his advantage. He was desperately trying to be funny in all kinds and circumstances which resulted in a terrible major realization in a subway accident. Joker was bound by his dreams (or delusions - depending on the viewer's perspective) and his vision of justice. The movie allows the audience to feel the hurt of Joker and horrible consequences of his actions. All artistic tools and contributions involved in this movie make this story full of anxiety and depression. This movie is a perfect companion for autumn melancholy and bad Halloween memories. "

At the same time, the film takes well-thought liberties with the characters it borrows. The eternal portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a benevolent, almost saintly billionnaire seems completely out of date, while Joker's choice of making him an obnoxious, egomaniac, out of touch capitalist is much more realistic. Similarly, toying with the idea that Arthur is the brother of Bruce Wayne seems fitting - though this whole framework is a bit cliched, so it is best that the film leaves the issue open.<br/><br/>For me, equally important is that even though the character is portrayed in sympathetic light, there remains no doubt he is a villain. So any concerns that the film could act as an apology for mass shooters, incels or whatever else are misguided - understanding how people are driven off the edge is not the same as glorifying them. Nor did I understand the news about viewers leaving the screening because of the violence - what violence? It's hardly a gore-fest, though its few violent scenes are maybe more realistic than usual.<br/><br/>The only part where the film fell short was the whole idea that Arthur's actions inspired violent riots all across Gotham. The idea of riots erupting in support over the murder of three people (when the public cannot even know they were scumbags) is a bit ludicrous - as is the idea that the rioting masses will rise up to cheer and follow a guy who murders a tv host live on air. If things worked like that, capitalism would have fallen long ago - and unlike other comic films (as generic a term as this has become now) Joker is in every other aspect not just realistic, but plausible.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this takes very little away from the enjoyment of a truly excellent movie - as great as Joaquin Phoenix is in it, he is far from the only reason to watch it. "
2750," This movie is like no other, just utterly amazing
"," All I have to say is watch this movie and do not expect it to be like the joker your originally know or any other superhero/villain move you have seen because this one is a masterpiece in its own realm that no other movie could touch. From start to finish this movie keeps you locked in. You always felt like something crazy was about to happen, and you wont be wrong, if you love thrills mixed with grim laughter this movies is for sure for you. If you cant stand blood or dark movies and expect it to be a lovey dovey Marvel esque movie then it might not be for you. I like a lot of Marvel movies even more than DC movies, but this one has to be up their with greatest of all time hero/villain movies ever. "

", Joker(2019) is not the conservative take on clown price of crime's origin story. The story is not related to comic book but everyone after watching this movie will forget about everyone who has played joker before joaquin pheonix. The film is dark and depicts arthur fleck's daily struggle with society while simultaneously fighting with a rare medical which corners him from society. The film portrays how a failed stand-up comedian turns criminal and what circumstances made him to do so. Joaquin pheonix is legendary in the movie his performance is on another level. He has made himself eternal as the Joker. In future when we will talk about joker we will most probably think of joaquin phenix's portrayal than any other one out there. The movie is a masterpiece and will be remebered as a cult classic for sure.

"," Joker. The Joker is quite an extraordinary Film. I was stunned when I saw it in the cinema. The sheer depth of the movie was mind-blowing and in the good way. I can see why the Americans don't favourite is for me it is simply too deep for them, there so shallow they can see the depth in the movie.
Joker is more like a European film than a dis American it's a stand-alone film ma that shows depth and perfect character development. we can see Arthur going from going from hiding himself in a shell that he calls Arthur but he unleashes what has always been hidden under Arthur in the end of the movie The Joker. I would expect Joaquin to get an Oscar for his perfect repetition of the Joker. "

"," The Movie takes place in a 1980's Gotham City where it's depicted as a city with wealth disparity extreme violence and lack of empathy, the movie stars Joaquin Felix playing a deranged, mentally ill and suicidal character named Arthur Fleck, who lives in poverty with his mother, and working minimum wage jobs in comedy as a party clown, as the movie progresses, life becomes even more miserable as he gets mugged, beat up, humiliated, shown no care or empathy for his mental condition, and having his medical support shut down, and with each event he's growing restless and grows closer to snapping, which he eventually does, killing 3 rich wall street brokers after getting assaulted by them, which inspires a city wide outbreak where the joker is depicted as a hero for killing the rich, which is really this movie's weakest point, as the plot and motive for the poor hating the rich is very superficial, and only works in the case of Arthur, who has a genuine but mistaken hatred for Thomas Wayne (Yes, him) for not helping his mother financially after working for him for 20 or so years, who he decides to confront, first by visiting his home which inevitably fails, and then by sneaking through a crowd of demonstrators wearing Clown masks, into a theater featuring a high end screening of a Charlie Chaplin movie of all people, attended by the wealthiest people in Gotham, including Thomas Wayne, which Arthur successfully confronts in a bathroom, and tells him that his mother was mentally ill and delusional, and reveals that Arthur was adopted, not wanting to accept the reality he had just been dealt, he heads into Gotham's mental hospital and discovers it's all really true, he decides that it's time to fully snap into the Joker persona, he starts by killing his mother, and then, Live on TV, he Shoots Murray, The late night talk show host played by Robert De Niro, who he always watched as a kid, in what could be described as the most shocking scene of murder in a movie, because of it's subtle and abrupt nature, as he's taken into police custody after the event with seemingly no resistance, he escapes by the help of the people who he inspired to riot, he stands up, and draws a smile on his face using his own blood, ""yes, he is the Joker"", is what that scene would say, if a scene could speak, the final scene is classic joker, shown escaping from Arkham Asylum after killing his therapist, with that trade mark smile.<br/><br/>A few side notes:<br/><br/>the movie pays some respect to comic books, and only the people who read the original stories, would appreciate some scenes, but it's really very subtle as to not leave others clueless, some of those include:<br/><br/>-Arkahm Mental Hospital Scene: where Arthur discovers the truth about his mother.<br/><br/>-Bruce Wayne as a child, along with young Alfred, the Wayne Family's Butler, in the scene where Arthur tries and fails to confront Thomas.<br/><br/>-The Famous Murder of Thomas &amp; Martha Wayne: in a dark alley as young Bruce watches, a thug shoots his parents which happened as part of the riot, which was ok at best, but could've been utilized better, however the classic snap of Martha Wayne's pearl necklace, was quite the homage to comic books.<br/><br/>-Arkham Asylum for the criminally insane: the culminating scene of the movie, Showing Joker escaping Arkham, foreshadowing an endless battle with Batman still to come.<br/><br/>The Movie's sounds were also superb, the lack of sound effects or any instruments, in really intense, moments is very brave, because that means, that there can not be any motivation to feel a certain way, except by what you see, in addition, the sound track ""That's Life"" was a really good choice for the movie, a sick and twisted character such as the Joker, benefits from it, in the wrong way, which in this movie's case, is the right way.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Joaquin Felix's performance, is Superb, especially, in the beginning, where he is just playing a mentally ill character, which is really difficult to portray, and you can honestly sympathize with, to a character that is exactly the right kind of deranged for a joker character, and you can honestly not sympathize with, the performance is just brilliant, this is truly the most crazy, twisted Joker portrayed on a screen ever, Original, yet paying respect to comic book roots, simply what a Joker movie should be, do yourself a favor and go see it.<br/><br/>9/10 ""Twisted &amp; Brilliant"" "
2772," A Psychological Journey
"," The film presents the mysterious psychological journey of Joker. It represents how society, family and workmates could trigger the criminality of one's mind. Arthur Fleck is presented as a victim of the world's tragedy forming up what he called a comedy. We could only refer to his suffering as an audience through our own bad experiences and we could relate to him in a way or two. I guess what this film wants to convey is that we are one bad day away from madness. "
2773," My life is a comedy
"," When I heard about a Joker movie I was a bit skeptical about it. Because usually knowing his origins isn't really a good thing. But I went into this movie with an open mind. And thankfully, I enjoyed it very much. One of the best things about it is definitely the acting. Joaquin Phoenix brings his A-game to this movie as well as everyone else. The music is amazing too. It fits perfectly with the time period. The story is also intriguing. It's not really new, but the way they did makes it feel fresh. The look is also amazing; I love the cinematography done here. And it can be pretty funny. I highly recommend this movie.<br/><br/>9.3/10 (Amazing) "
2774," I don't think I've seen such an impactful film since 2014
"," Our audience started applauding at the end of our 10pm SUNDAY screening. SUNDAY. I was devastated by the authenticity of Arthur's emotions. I believe this is a film for the ages. Not since 2014 (Whiplash, Birdman) have I felt this devastated after a film. It's a required watch for fans of Batman, DC or movies in general. I'm going back tomorrow, btw. "

2782," You must see this movie!!
", Great movie!! Joaquin was excellent in his performance and the story was really good. I usually do not like movies that includes only one good character but this one is a must to see. 
2783," A disturbing and dreamlike character study to rival the classics
"," This film is an interesting one. It's almost too much to take in the first time you watch it. The film is very much in the same vain as Taxi Driver and King of Comedy as to be expected, these inspirations were never a secret to begin with but it also somewhat reminds me of the more recent Nightcrawler, another incredible crime noir about a psychopath. That being said I think Joker takes on a much more dreamlike tone, every scene feels grounded and realistic at the same time as being avant-garde. It's quite impressive honestly. Let's get into some spoilers shall we? First let's discuss my least favourite thing about the film which isn't even much of a complaint and that's the plot twist surrounding Zazie Beetz' character Sophie... I personally found the twist very predictable but at the same time the people I went to see it with didn't see it coming at all so I can't say definitively it was a predictable twist, on the other hand I actually still think it works, predictable or not. Arthur is an incredibly lonely man and the idea that he would meet this beautiful woman he wanted to be with and delude himself into thinking she wanted the same is a believable one. Next I'd like to talk about the violence. This film has less than most films of the comic genre but when it happens it makes up for that with its brutality. The violence here is truly disturbing and more graphic than I was expecting, one scene in particular involving a pair of scissors had me practically shielding my eyes, it's gnarly stuff. If you know the joker as a character and have read The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns this film wont have too many surprises as it takes quite a lot of inspiration from those two stories in particular, but it does put its own spin on them and adds enough of its own intriguing questions to keep you interested even as a die hard fan. Now, let's talk about the clown himself, Joaquin Phoenix. This man is a force of nature. His performance here is truly unforgettable and as many have been saying Oscar worthy. It's hard to explain what makes his performance so good but watch it and you'll know what I mean. Another thing I adore about this film it's ambiguity to a lot of the events in it. Although somewhat explained, Arthur's true parentage is still left somewhat in the air, allowing you to make your own mind up on who and what to believe. The same goes for the ending of the film which is executed in such a way that you don't know wether the previous events of the film were all some sick fantasy or wether they really happened and this was the outcome, this idea that anyone can believe what they want and anyone can be right (or wrong) is a refreshing one that we don't get too often in cinema. Lastly I want to talk about the cinematography and soundtrack. The cinematography is fantastic. From the bright, colour faded streets of Gotham in the day to the dark, dank subways they've really made Gotham feel like a real place and captured its essence from the comics at the same time. Shots are usually uncomfortably close or filled with negative space and this really helps pull you in to Arthur's world. The soundtrack is one of my favourite things about this whole film. Its Subtle, grinding basses and violins are beautifully haunting and help make this film what it is in my opinion. The bathroom and final scene are standouts. Overall I believe this film is a masterpiece. It's not for everyone but if you are like me and love, gritty, noir crime thrillers this should be on your watchlist. I'm gonna give Joker a 9.5/10. Max... Out. "
2784," masterpiece
", Joker is a film that is disturbing and uncomfortable in all the right ways. It manages to pull off an original and unique spin in the superhero genre. The only complaint in the film that I can think of is that it is just a bit too simaler to taxi driver and king of comedy. Don't believe the contravercy trying to make you afraid to see this movie. If movies were restricted from telling a story questioning ourselves and our actions than we have ruined the art of Cinema as we know it. 
2785," Say no more! Just watch it
"," Watching this movie seems like sitting with dementors for 2 hours (in a good way, obviously). They spread the darkness and eat your soul. "
2786," Dark movie with phenomenal performance by Phoenix
"," It has been such a long time for a movie to receive such divisive reviews. However, one thing for sure is that Joaquin Phoenix delivered the performance of a lifetime. For example, when he transformed into Joker, his whole body changed, and that newfound sense of confidence could be felt. It isnt a typical comic book movie, but I believe that this new approach DC is taking has a lot o potential. "
2787," Top 3 Jokers of all time
"," Excellent piece of art, one character carries the all movie, thast way it's impressive, ledger did it but along side Batman figure, Phoenix was a oneman show "
2788," Brilliant
"," One of the best movies I've seen in years! Well written character development and excellent acting by Phoenix makes this movie a must see. If you want to explore the madness that makes this clown laugh, then you must experience the sadness and despair that he battles. If you think Batman is his archenemy, you would be wrong. "
2789," Masterpiece
"," A incredible construction od character with and tremenduous conclusion, opening the door for a whole new and darker Batman universe in movies. This movies demands a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Actor for the amazing Joaquin Phoenix performance. A masterpiece that will be remembered not just another super-heroe movie (like Avengers), but a dark and heavy must-watch movie. That's the Joker everyone wanted to see!! Hope they don't mess up on Robert Pattison's Batman, cause if they don't, this new Batman chronology will be the best one for sure! "
2790," You must understand
", There have been many movies I have watched over the years. I have seen them all. I must say that movies that are written well are those that make you get lost in the story. Ones that make you feel like you are roght there with the character. That is real movie artistry. Thats what I found in Joker. Well done people well done. 
2791," A Stunning character study
", Watch this movie with a open mind. Simply a amazing movie. 
2792," Its not Disneyland
",
2793," Whole new level
"," I believed all of the hype and went to this movie with extremely high expectations. This movie exceeded them in every aspect possible. All I can hope for now is to see Joaquin in another film as the Joker. This movie was so dark and disturbing which I felt was the best part. Unreal character development, unbelievable soundtrack and eerily relevant to modern day problems. I fee the critics were afraid to give this movie better reviews just in case there is some public backlash. Very risky film in today's climate. Enjoy everyone! "
2794," Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of a lifetime in this ultra dark character of an iconic DC villain.
"," Joaquin Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, a disturbed loner who has absolutely no luck in life from the fact that he is an actual clown by trade and the very first scene in the film he is seen getting beatdown &amp; robbed from street gang, to the fact that he also lives with his delusional mother. From that point on you know your gonna be in for a rough ride
For those expecting a action film or an exciting movie you will be sorely disappointed. This is a brooding slow burn character piece that boils up to a mesmerising climax. The cameo's and easter eggs in this film will please true fans from the graphic novels.
The movie takes and its inspiration from Martin Scorsese's King Of Comedy &amp; Taxi Driver (both with De Niro) to its style, plot &amp; tone.
Joaquin Phoenix is truley astonishing in every way possible and deserves an Oscar nomination. Robert De Niro also stands out in a minimal role as the host of Gotham's late night TV show.
This will not be for everyone as it is extremely bleak and grim throughout, with some shocking scenes of violence.
As an original take on the Joker's origins and the state of gotham, it is very well made and one of the best films of the year. "
2795," Great!!
"," The movies acting is off the charts, but it does start off slow. The whole movie builds up for an amazing ending. The last 15-20 mind are worth going to the theaters to watch this gem of a movie. "

As soon as it was over I wanted to see it again. yes Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar he is a fantastic character actor, this film has made me want to go and watch all of his films.

2801," First IMDb review. Lucky I get to do it on Joker.
"," Insane, gritty, and darkly beautiful in it's own comical way....joker is one hell of a character study that injects pure chaos straight into your eyes and makes you perturbed. Phoenix's masterful showcase of Arthur's descent into madness is powerful, and loudly screams for an oscar nomination. "
2802," Empathy Dies and A Joker is Born
"," Joker is making lots of headlines. Here's my take. Joker is a peer to A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver vs. a superhero movie. Joker is a very dark character piece on how a damaged loner is alienated beyond his breaking point. This is a very disturbing and excellent film. Joaquin Phoenix will be a Best Actor nominee for certain. The movie is drenched with important issues- mental illness, income disparity, healthcare, and how a society responds when these needs are not met. Joker is about the death of empathy. Jokers are created, they don't fall out of a comic book or become evil because they played too much Grand Theft Auto. I've read about folks walking out of this movie. I hope that those folks simply miscalculated, thinking they were going to see Iron Man or Captain America. The alternative reason is choosing not to see the seeds of dystopia all around us "
2803," Best movie of 2019
", Film of the year! If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win a Oscar I'm gonna be really shocked cause he's great. 
2804," A magnificent cynosure of a performance
", A magnificent cynosure of a performance from Joaquin Phoenix in a film that sacrifices Character development in other areas to direct it 100% towards feeding a raw energy into Arthur Fleck's delicate descent into darkness .... the spotlight of the Joker. 
2805," Joker not as you know
"," Finally an origin story on DC's and perhaps the most iconic bad guy of the comic universe comes to the big screen. Like the mask on the infamous clown, the movie paints a deep portrayal of a misunderstood individual and society's qualms towards mental health. For decades, the Joker has been the bane to Batman and Gotham City, but here we see that Gotham City failed Arthur Fleck and created the Joker we have grown accustomed too . Joaquin Phoenix's powerful performance no doubt changes the Joker from villain to victim and hopefully one of an Oscar winner. "
2806," A work of art
"," This movie has a dark and gritty atmosphere that works with the tragedy that is Arthur Fleck/ Joker in this adaptation of the clown prince of crime, this is a beatifully dark tale of descent into madness and how society treats mental illness, ending in a masterpiece of a crescendo that screams Joker in all the right ways. "
2807," There is only one Joker
", This movie lives up to the hype!!! Hands down no question the best played Joker. Smart. Original. Made to see in theaters. If you want wow this it. This is not a comic book movie it's an Oscar winning film. This will blow your mind. 
2808," Simply a fantastic film!
"," I rarely review films but felt compelled to leave a review for this masterpiece. Believe the hype, this film is a triumph and I left the cinema in awe. JP is amazing and I'm sure he'll bag an Oscar for his performance. Please go and watch this film. "
2809," 100% brilliant

2810," Go see it!
", Don't believe the rubbish that has came out on this film being dangerous. It is a fantastic film and phoenix is phenomenal as the joker. I do hope to see more from him in this role but I'd be just as happy if this is it.

2815," PJ JONOTHON's Joker Review
"," I'm not a harsh critic, nor am I a huge comic book fan. I don't know of the intrinsic politics between the batman comics and the films, as I only know the basic dynamics between Batman and Joker. I feel that the film has done very well in tying up any loose threads and plausible theories of Joker's origins.
The great thing about this film is that it does not want to definitively label or force Joker's origins into: 'I AM Joker, half brother of Bruce Wayne.' Or 'I am Joker, this IS where I've come from.' The film opens up unconfirmed avenues and at a logical guess, toys with the hardcore fans on what the true reality of Joker's life is to be. Nevertheless, it brings a certain ambiance and concept to Joker's origin, which is the best thing we as viewers can hope for.<br/><br/>This film can also be applauded since it is a standalone film from any comic book adaption franchises, so in essence, this film is simply about a mentally ill man's descent into complete meltdown and chaos.<br/><br/>Praise must be given to Phoenix for opting to portray such an iconic character, and not only for the portrayal, but for attempting to accurately portray the deterioration of mental health. Several blog posts are now being born as to which actor is the best Joker...I believe that this film CANNOT be pushed into this debate.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, no other actor has had to portray the man behind Joker, or his origins for longer than 30 minutes. Therefore, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker has bought about a new debate: which actor is best at portraying Arthur Fleck? Right now, it can only be Phoenix. This is the point that I feel is being missed right now.<br/><br/>As to the ending of the film, Joker in the white room, was the film's events it all reported speech? An hallucination? A fabrication? My opinion, and my only non-obtrusive opinion is that all events had existed except for hallucinations that are made obvious. So, the only speculations that can exist are: is Joker related to Batman? Was Thomas Wayne a crook? Who were Joker's true parents? Yet the most curious art of this scene, is the flashback to Bruce standing with his shot parents... this can only mean that Joker already had a plan of revenge against the Wayne family to even be thinking about the child of Thomas Wayne. Whether or not his adoptive mother had an affair with Thomas or not, it is clear that Joker as a certain amount of resentment, anger towards the Wayne family.<br/><br/>An only criticism I can find is the film's classification here in the UK. Here it is rated a 15, which I feel may be Inappropriate. I'm all for the encouragement of mental health awareness, but the way this film invites the viewer into Joker's mental health could be very impressionable onto a 15/16 year-old viewer who also struggles with mental health. I feel that the film should be an 18 but, Hollywood + money = ignorance.<br/><br/>Overall, this film brings a very positive, curious insight to an iconic villain of Gotham, and we can hope that future films take these curiosities further. Although, given that Joker is a very unstable, unreliable character for truth, it would be shame for any film for comic to give Joker a definitive backstory. "

", Went into the film with unrealistic expectations and scepticism and left having my unrealistic expectations exceeded and a longing to watch it again 
2822," ALMOST Heath Ledger worthy
"," The movie is depressing from the first scene when Arthur gets jumped trying to make a the bare minimum of a living. Already being depressive, every interaction with other people is driving him further into a corner.<br/><br/>In the train scene he is trying to look away as the three bankers start harassing the young woman but his uncontrollable laughter draws their attention to him. Again, he's the one being attacked but this time he's being pushed over the edge and commits his first kill(s).<br/><br/>He doesn't feel remorse or guilt, which makes every following kill easier. Philipps sets the joker up as an anti hero out for revenge, killing people who harmed him in the past but letting the ones nice to him live. The scene in his apartment when his little colleague tries to open the door chain is one of the tensest moments I've seen in a movie.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much, Arthur trancends more and more into madness, realizing his whole life he has been lied to and abused.<br/><br/>The increasing violence shows his decreasing respect for human life. He starts to hurt innocent people (he's suddenly no longer living in his apartment but in his ""girlfriends"") but the movie leaves open what has happened to her and her daughter.<br/><br/>My only complain would be that the genius of the joker is missing. He acts impulsive and emotional, getting caught by police and not planning in advance. This for me is the biggest caveat as it makes it difficult tounderstand how the joker will become the crimal mastermind portrayed in the Batman movies.<br/><br/>Phoenix performance is absolutely brilliant, but does not beat Heath Ledger "
2823," HISTORICAL PERFORM
", Simply historical Phoenix performance. Complex character. 
2824," OK well this was brilliant.
"," I love Joaquin Pheonix and when I learned he was playing Joker I had to see this film. It is not a perfect masterpiece and neither is it that so bad like the snowflake review bombing critics are making it out to be. The acting, cinematography, and music are goosebumps inducing. The story is also nice. Please go watch it. The weak points are a certain female character that wasn't explored more, and a certain unnecessary sub plot which I am not going to spoil and let you judge for yourself. Overall very enjoyable movie and Joaquin's Joker is a worthy successor to the great Heath Ledger's Joker. Hope Pheonix wins or gets nominated for an oscar for this chilling performance as the Joker. "
2825," A 10 on ten across multiple timelines.
"," Believe the hype, it is indeed a masterpiece. As a keen observer of films, this goes right in the Top 10 Movies ever made across timelines.<br/><br/>This should definitely win an academy for male actor, cinematography, original score and direction. "
2826," An instant one-of-a-kind classic.
",
2827," Disturbing perfection
"," This movie will keep you thinking for days after watching. Dark, gritty, disturbing and heart wrenching. It definitely sends a message that people need to hear about our society now. Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Just go see it.. "
2828," Fantastic
", Joachim Phoenix deserves an academy award for playing such a complex character. 
2829," OSCAR WORTHY
"," Best film I've seen in a long time
it is gritty, suspense and amazing
Joaquin Phoenix's performance is the best performance in a long time
Also, the cinematography was outstanding and the music score is haunting and excellent
This movie needs to win best picture, best actor, best director, best original screenplay and best cinematography "
2830," Amazing
"," Amazing movie, and I would like to watch it again :) "
2831," Very good
", Impactant and amazing. Joaquim Phoenix is fant√°stic. 
2832," Do you call it miniature golf or just golf?
"," The Joker is back and he's great. A great beginning with hopefully more to come. Focusing on acting more than action, it's an enjoyable if not disturbing film and any fan of DC should love this film. It inevitably leaves you wanting more and I look forward to seeing him again. Hahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha haha. "
2833," A complaint about the movie
"," Only thing I can complain regarding Joker that the way that Waynes are murdered. There is an idea behind that murder in this movie but we know that Bruce's family was killed by an ordinary, stupid thief and for nothing. This makes the transformation of Bruce to Batman reasonable. Otherwise, there is no reason for Bruce to be Batman as we see in the movie. "
2834," What a film!!
"," This will definitely go down in history as a classic.
It's really an Oscar worthy movie.<br/><br/>Mind blowing acting by Joaquin.
I seriously wish that before next Oscar no other movie with someone doing acting better than what Joaquin did (I doubt if it's even possible to act better than that.) should come so that he can win an Oscar. "
2835," Amazing!!
", I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an oscar this year then something is wrong with this world 
2836," Beautifully tragic
"," It was fantastically done. I was worried after the Leto incident with the character, but Phoenix did such a good job of it. An absolute masterpiece. "
2837," Piece of art
"," The acting, cinematography soundtrack AMAZING. Watching a man with a mental illness struggle in society, as real life as we're gona get with an origin story. Blew my mind, i believed the hype and expected it to be good but it still shook me.<br/><br/>The plunge into darkness made me feel uneasy and the violent scenes had me gasping in shock. Need to go see it again! "
2838," Truly amazing ü§°
"," One of the best acting performances I have ever seen from Phoenix. Keeps you glued to your seat and it will live long in the memory, If could rate this movie higher I would. Film of the year and maybe film of the decade. ü§° "
2839," Worth seeing - It kept me at awe the whole time
"," This movie was extremely good. One of those actor driven movies made in very good taste. No constant shaky cameras, no short-hand cut scenes, no bad CGI and a lot of pure breathtaking moments (more in the second part of the movie).<br/><br/>I usually don't give a 10, but this movie deserves every praise it can get. It managed to get so many emotions out of me that I think it deserves a spot between the greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>Before going to the movie, make sure you understand that this is a complete character development movie with a lot of dark and depressing moods and scenes.<br/><br/>I take a bow to Joaquin Phoenix. "
2840," Masterpiece !
"," The acting, screenplay, cinematography and music are just something worth of a top 10 all time. The movie is dark and powerful with each sequence bringing more and more emotions and mixed feelings. The Joker character is simply unreal, I don't think even a crazy person can act better than Joaquin did in this representation. He's acting is so powerful that makes you really think and have mixed judgements about him. It was simply a masterpiece in terms of acting. I've seen all the Joker representations so far and I can definitely say this one is the best one, the most powerful and authentic one. Some of the scenes are also so well directed that literally give a shake on the inside, where you go like ""wtf just happened"" ! If this movie doesn't receive an oscar for best actor, directing, screenplay and music, there is something wrong right there.<br/><br/>That scene on the stairs, the depth with those 2 agents sitting at the top, him putting a perfectly crazy dance, the music aligned with it. ""Oh my...!"" "
2841," Best Movie That I Ever Seen!!
"," Going to this movie i was ready to be dissaponted but i can gladly say that wasnt the case.
Phoenix's performance is one of a kind, he have it all, the sound track was perfect and gave a contrast over whats happening in the scene.
The first part of the movie is a little slow, but is layng the ground work for the astounding second half.
The only thing i have to point out (not the movies fault) is the rating in Portugal, they gave it a 14 and older, the movie should be at least a 16 and older, since the movie features some sensitive t√≥picos.
But overall it stands as one of the best and it probably be remenber as a movie of the decade. "
2842," Just incredible.
"," The performance from Joaquin phoenix is Oscar worthy. So is the cinematography, music, script itself and so much more. "
2843," FANTASTIC
",
2844," A Masterpiece
"," First of all get this man an Oscar because he certainly deserves it . Man the movie was much more than I expected, after the movie ended the entire audience showed a wonderful applause because as I mentioned it's a Masterpiece . Screw all the haters saying that this movie is too violent , I admit there might be some slightly terrifying scenes but there is nothing that terrifying to leave the movie . I'm 16 years of age and I have seen much more mental and violent movies than this . I wanna thank Tod Phillips for bringing this Masterpiece to life and I hope he'll keep making more amazing movies like this in the near future . Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for bringing the joker each and everyone desperately needed . "
2845," Speechless
", First time I've heard people clapping at the end of a movie. Instant classic. 
2846," Joaquin plays a perfect tortured Joker.
"," I saw the hype. I saw the negative spin the media tried to portray the movie in. I saw the reports of the eight minute standing ovation at the screenings. I saw the review bomb attempts the Rotten Tomatoes professional critics were giving Joker. And I went and watched the movie myself. Joaquin Phoenix has created a man who had his entire life and beliefs fall apart in a week, and learn that even those closest to him never really knew him, or lied to him, or were responsible for the pain he was going through his entire life. The worst part was, they did not even care or notice what had been done to him. His story, this take on Joker, this is what creates a supervillain, a man so broken by society that his last resort is to laugh at the futility and sadness and rage that has been forced upon him. "
2847," Great performance by Joaquin
"," Started off slow, but it was necessary. The whole character development was outstanding. It was dark and gritty, couldn't look away for one moment. I felt pity for joker, you really get an understanding on why he's so messed up. Joaquin Phoenix was great, it's acting that's rarely seen. Majority of actors just speak the words without having to become the character, not Joaquin... he truly becomes the psychotic villain.
I do wish the movie would have been another hour longer, maybe I'm being greedy, but I wanted even more Joaquin Phoenix as joker. "
2848," Didn't expect this much realism.
"," Film keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Amazing cinematography.
I am a big Dark Knight fan, but this movie makes dark knight triology look like a fairytale. Very realistic approach to comic book story telling.üëå "
2849," Wow, I'm impressed
"," I was honest to god expecting a garbage truck fire, Philips hadn't exactly proved himself prior to this film, Scorsese was involved but very early on and I assumed he dropped out for good reason, we have had 3 different jokers in about 10 years and honestly the idea of a Joker origin story seemed stupid, but my god this movie works, it's fantastic, a must see and definitely an oscar contender "
2850," A CASE STUDY ON MENTAL ILLNESS
"," Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mentally ill man whose illness and medications are documented, but unfortunately fall through the cracks of society. Sounds all too familiar in today's world. Phoenix is brilliant as he takes us on a dark journey from picked on loner to delusional murderer. There is definitely a Taxi Driver and King of Comedy influence on the film and Batman Begins as the movie takes place in a dreary time in a major metropolis. The connection to Bruce Wayne is interesting as well as the reason for the Joker's laugh. This is a dark movie may not be for everyone but to me deserves at least a 9 out of 10. "
2851," Nice movie thanks Hollywood for this dramatic movie
"," How much we missed for this kind of film. Joaquin and the character JOKER I see a beautiful chemistry between this two characters.
Thank DC for this movie.
HKM. "
2852," Terrific Acting, awesome Movie!!
"," This is my first review ever. I had to do it. I just wanna thank Joaquin and the director for having given us such an extraordinary masterpiece. And if Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar, apague y v√°monos.. Ha ha ha, je je "
2853," One of the best movies ever
"," Wow. There are few words that can describe how good this movie is. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix deserve my standing ovation. They created such an unique movie, that's at the same time fantastic and terrifying. "
2854," Superb Acting by Joaquin Phoenix
", I was riveted by Joaquin's acting. Usually I get bored midway through movies but Joaquin kept my attention the whole time. What a great actor who draws in the audience and keeps them on the edge of their seat. I'm not a fan of comic book movies but this was very good and believeable. 
2855," I don't usually side with the audience, but here we are...
"," Although it is technically a superhero movie, it is by far the best movie in the genre. How did it do it? By not being a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Being a psychological thriller of a character we have known for almost 80 years, that has had multiple stories about why he is as he is, we knew this movie was going to have a hard job to impress.<br/><br/>It did it.<br/><br/>The story is super dark, which actually is fitting for a character that kills and that tries to take a city as part of a joke. Even the few jokes that appear in the movie are not oversaturating it.<br/><br/>The music is an astounding job. It sometimes goes too loud and over the dialog, but nothing distracting, although a couple of times unfitting.<br/><br/>The scenography is just perfect for Gotham, a city that has less sun than England.<br/><br/>The acting is extremely solid. Everyone gave everything they had and left their soul in this movie. Maybe in the last scenes with Robert the Niro he dropped the ball a little and the acting was a lot more stiff and less natural, but not enough to ruin the experience.<br/><br/>The direction is in general solid. A couple of pointers in 2 or 3 scenes that are not enough to ruin the movie.<br/><br/>The edition was great, as well as the special effects. The movie feels at times like dragging itself and artificially making itself longer, but those scenes are so rare and far in between that in general they don't ruin the experience.<br/><br/>Just what I expected from a film that takes an actual look at mental disorders and the way society works. Great film overall, would watch again. And not many movies that have appeared in the last 10 years or so can say the same. "
2856," Amazing
", Absolutely amazing his performance is definitely a 10 outa 10 
2857," Absolutely phenomenal.
", Takes a lot to get a reaction out of me. But let me tell you something about this film; Go See It.<br/><br/>Just do yourself a favor and go see it! 
2858," Beautiful Disaster
"," After what I saw today, I believe Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. One of the best films I've seen in a long time. If anyone else could play the Joker other than Heath, it's Joaquin. Every depiction of Joker are so different, but this film is on a whole different level. This film is a true masterpiece. The score was amazing....chilling to the bone. I truly hope this film is nominated for an Oscar for best film, best director, best actor and best score. "
2859," The Joker is REAL.
"," Nicely done. Phoenix's interpretation of the Joker is by far one of the best I've seen. Not only is the acting Oscar worthy but the build up of the storyline is unbelievable! It depicts something real, dark while still playing into the comics character. "
2860," A film to reflect on
",
2861," A Must See!
", King of it's genre! Forget that Batman is even a part of the legend for he is not even mentioned throughout the course of the film. A thrillride that will quite possibly hit home to many on several levels. Do Not Deprive Yourself! 
2862," Oscar worthy performance
"," I never thought I'd see the day when someone would portray the Joker in as captivating a way as Heath Ledger. Well, the day has come! Joaquin Phoenix's embodiment of Arthur Fleck was legendary. This is not to say that Phoenix outdid Ledger. I don't think it is truly possible to compare them side by as they are telling very different stories. Ledger's performance was a portrayal of the unhinged, psychotic, Clown Prince of Crime who wanted to watch the world burn and was done masterfully. Phoenix, on the other hand, was telling the story of Arthur Fleck, the mentally ill, awkward, dissociated yet initially pitiable man who would metamorphose into the Joker. His depiction of the Joker felt less like an evil criminal mastermind bent on destroying everything and more like Russell Crowe's depiction of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, albeit far less beautiful, far more unnerving, and I don't believe that John Nash ever stabbed someone with scissors and beat their head into a wall. At the beginning, I empathized with Arthur Fleck. He was a man who the universe chewed up. He suffered from severe mental illness, a society on the verge of collapse and was an outcast. In the scene on the bus when he was trying to entertain the little boy until the boy's mother chastised him, I almost cried. I felt he was just defending himself in his first killings, until he chased down the last of the three men and shot him multiple times. He was relatable. I didn't find it at all difficult to follow his slow, devolving descent into hell and murder.<br/><br/>A truly excellent movie! "
2863," Some of the best acting I've ever seen. Wow.
"," Phoenix completely nailed the role. His transition from Arthur to Joker was so well developed, and every move he made had me on the edge of my seat. So well done, I'm practically speechless. "
2864," Brilliant!
", This movie sets the background for many upcoming blockbusters! Joaquin Phoenix was superb! 
2865," Most incredible
"," Most incredible movie ever been made the direction the soundtracks joaquins acting everything was perfect, i have hadn't seen any mistake in that movie . "
2866," Absolutely a breathtaking movie

2867," Outstanding movie all of time
", Incredible writer. Incredible actor. Best dc movie all of time 
2868," 10 is not enough
"," Wow! Great character development, the struggle is real. It all ties together so well. Excellent portrayal from JP. There is award in the future for sure "
2869," One of the greatest movies of all time
"," I didn't think when I walked into that screening I would be experiencing one of the greatest movies of the 21st century so far. The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely mesmerizing to watch. The cinematography is beautiful and Todd Phillips's direction is great as well. This movie will be remembered for years and is on par with the greats like Fight Club and Pulp Fiction. It's definitely worth the watch. No movie is perfect, sure it has flaws, but they didn't bother me at all when watching, please don't miss this movie. "
2870," I'm not a ""professional critic""
"," This film is excellent, from the setting, the character development, the story and I have to say Phoenix was breath taking. Really moving to see life as the ""bad guy"" from his perspective.<br/><br/>All in all an incredible performance all round! "
2871," Move in One Sentence
", The first thing I did after leaving the theater was buying a ticket for the next show. 
2872," MASTERPIECE
"," I was skeptical prior to watching due to all the hype. But wow - Phoenix really owns the character, adding his own spin to Joker as we know him. The boundaries are pushed more and more which was a precedent set by Heath Ledger in Dark knight, adding a deeper facet to the Joker and coupled by the back story, cinematic precision and a really good story, JOKER is everything DC'ers have longed for since the Christopher Nolan Trilogy. Legacy links to Wayne's, Bruce and the death of Thomas created a real connection to all the stories we have watched before. I just hope the next Batman movie supersedes this - and a Batman &amp; Joker movie is a MUST. "
2873," Not a superhero movie, but rather a super movie about a person
"," If you go watch Joker expecting the usual superhero tropes with good guys and villains (and maybe Batman?), you will be disappointed. But if you expect a really good story about human existence, Joker delivers and does it really well!<br/><br/>Joker is the story about and unfortunate random person - one that in real life may even live in your same neighborhood - that had a difficult life and is completely abandoned by society, and his development into the villain we all know (or though we knew?). This movie reminds us that evil people are often not born evil: they are created by society and people that surround them.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's performance is incredible and perfectly incarnates the Joker; he is the main reason that makes this movie as good as it is. The narration pace is sustained, with never a dull moment but without going too quickly either. The whole mix works really well, to the point of creating one of the best movies of the last years. Go watch it. "
2874," Powerful
"," This guy deserves an Oscar, the movie is beautifully sad and the Close-ups on the faces show the immensity of the talent of the actor and director, it's a spectacular film, you forget the DC universe and superheroes, it's the time of the villains. "
2875," You have to see this!!!!
", Wow...blown away!! The actin in this is soooooo soooo goood....believe the hype and go c this sickkkkkkkk filmmmmmmm!!! 
2876," Tied With Dark Knight As My Favorite Comic Book Movie
"," This film was an absolute masterpiece! From the acting, directing, score, etc everything was done so well done, however be warned that those last 45 minutes are intense. I highly recommend this movie! "
2877," Makes a great character study and executes a brilliant film.
",
2878," A perfect ode to Heath Ledger
",
2879," I hated it but couldn't stop watching
", I can't even explain this you literally just need to go watch. I absolutely hated how he was treated in his marginalisation by society and at one point (subway scene) I was crying because my heart hurt for him. But it was the most powerful film I've ever seen and I have to keep reminding myself that it is not real and is only a film. 
2880," Best movie of the year
"," In my opinion, this is the best movie of the year and may become my favourite movie of all time given another viewing. But that's mostly because I love the Joker and have always loved the outcast characters. This movie just had a lot of things that I really liked, the ending, in my opinion, was perfect, allowing enough interpretation without undermining the story. It this movie flawless? No, of course not. But it is the best cinimatic joker origion I think were going to get. "
2881," Masterpiece
"," Joaquin is one of the best acting performers I've ever seen
And Thank you tod for this amazing movie "
2882," The most realistic Joker back-story there's ever been...
"," As soon as the film begins, we aren't confronted with someone whose personality will make their journey to becoming The Joker a predictable one. The movie's director has wisely gone with the idea of having the audience experience every stage of Arthur Fleck's descent into insanity. Joaquin Phoenix's performance ably shows that outward circumstances created Batman's number one foe. He then becomes a more sympathetic character, even though he is gradually morphing into a monster. The shooting of the three bankers comes at a pint when all the bad things that have happened to Fleck psychologically overwhelm him.
From then on, all the people who have heaped misery onto his state of mind become the vat of chemicals that physically turned him into Joker. Near the end of the movie, Todd Phillips cleverly has Fleck's final murderous act becomes the catalyst for Bruce Wayne's parents to be murdered. Though it's a standalone film, this ending sets things up for the reboot of the Batman film franchise, in spite of that not being Phillips' intention. This movie deserves more than one Academy Award nomination and it deserves more than one Oscar win. "
2883," Send in the Oscars
"," Incredible story with an incredible performance from Phoenix. It was such a complex character to portray and I can't imagine anybody else being able to do it. I was curious to see how he would approach the character and how the troubled soul would become 'The Joker'<br/><br/>Todd Phillips has somehow tied the story in perfectly with Bruce Wayne and his parents, whilst using the platform as a homage to other films from this era (1979?), like King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. It's both familiar and utterly unique.<br/><br/>It's a scary portrayal of how a mentally troubled loner who is wronged by society can find comfort and their smile through dark means. "
2884," Joaquin Phoenix, that's all.
"," I wouldn't believe that someone after Heath Ledger would be able to perform such magical performance for the Joker. I must say Joaquin, your desire to be such person is something that we can't put it in our sentence. Thank you for this incredible show. "
2885," Outstanding acting and amazing joker movie
", The movie was extremely good to go inside of the joker's life with his perspective. And there is no moment you lose your focus from screen. And Joaquin Phoneix definitely deserves Oscar with his performance. You should watch this movie at cinema. Joker was one of the best origin movie I have ever seen with no doubt! 
2886," A goddamn masterpiece
", Joaquin Phoenix delievers an even better performance than Heath Ledger. The cinematography is our if this world and the best scene is the talkshow scene. 
2887," Hyper real take on a murderer, Gotham as the backdrop
"," A failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) takes on the establishment and analyses his life, as events unfold on the fine line between tragedy/comedy.<br/><br/>Isolated by his society, it's unfortunate that unlike in Her, the tech is not available for Phoenix to have the sweet beautiful sensual voice of ScarJo to keep him from loneliness, instead only his sick mother!<br/><br/>This leaves Fleck stumbling for a connection, slowly descending into madness, leading him to what all depressives do, try stand-up comedy! He gets poor reviews, however he definitely has better delivery and material than say Russel Howard. Ultimately he aspires to get a spot on Late Night, hosted by De Nero in a return to form Jay Leno/David Letterman role.<br/><br/>This is a hyper real take on the Joker, where the backdrop is Gotham, but it could be anywhere - following a serial murderer. The links to the DC world are almost the weakest parts and just necessary. If Phoenix was portraying a real person, then he wins an Oscar for this performance. "
2888," Brilliant Screenplay, Marvelous Performance..
", A movie should win oscar in every category. One of the best movie i have ever seen in decades...

2890," DC's best film yet!
"," Joker is a top tier film with great pacing, just the right amount of action, great cinematography, an unforgettable score and perfect acting by Joaquin Phoenix. A must see for any comic book fan and even if you don't enjoy comic book or superhero/villain verse movies, Joker manages to be a movie for everyone who enjoys great film, except ur kids of course ;). One of my new favourite movies personally and I would recommend it to anyone as long as your aren't bothered by the gratuitous violence and disturbing themes. "
2891," Nailed It!
", Arguably the top match for the heath ledger performance = Joaquin phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix nailed it. 
2892," The Clown Prince of Crime is born!
",
2893," Polish the Oscars
"," People are walking out because this movie hits home. As realistic as it can get! Everyone did an amazing job getting this film done. Even though DC fans may know what's coming next, it will still cause sweet beautiful shock, the kind you have not experienced in years.<br/><br/>Leave your brats at home. "
2894," I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy
"," The movie starts and so the suffering of Arthur Fleck, he tries to be good with people but everytime he is punished for that, even the condition he has who makes him laugh spontaneously makes it worst.The movie makes you empathize with the character because the world is so mean to him and make you think if not the society create these monsters.At the final theres a great twist and a super satisfying ending. "
2895," Amazing and original
"," I think that this movie was created for a mature public, and as a mature person I loved it "
2896," Heath ledgers fans CALM DOWN!!!
"," Very strong build up character with great storytelling. I enjoyed every moment in the movie, from the begining until the end without forgetten the class performance by Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to say Heath performed better neither Phoenix, both portrayals were great.<br/><br/>I will sum my review with one word ""Iconic"" "
2897," Joaquin Phoenix Delivers
"," Joker is a masterful look into the mind of a psychopath. The tension was palpable in the theatre, people cowered and screamed at every display of the Joker's unparalleled insanity. Joker is a compelling look into treading the line between psychotic and normal, chaotic and peaceful, evil or disturbed. Joaquin Phoenix was truly better than perfection in this role. "
2898," Amazing Movie
"," I'm no longer a huge fan of many super hero movies. And it seems like DC has not really been able to find a formula like Marvel has in order to produce good ones. They often picked gritty movies for the wrong superhero. However, this movie is one of the greatest super hero movies of all time. "
2899," A mastered work of art
", The Joker was beautifully brilliant! Amazing cinematography. Exceptional storytelling. Impeccable acting. The action of this film was unexpected. For once I could not anticipate the next move. It's sheer genius and creativity. In a world where we are moving at such a vivacious pace it took me down a slow journey into the darkness trauma can bring. And it was a sweet twist on the the Batman origin story! If you love the artistry of filmmaking than it is a must see. 
2900," Unbelievable
"," Never in a million years would I have expected Todd Phillips to make a movie of this caliber. It falls into what I'd like to believe is a sub genre of comic book films, like Logan and Brightburn, where the world of superheros is more dark and intense than the action/comedy cookie cutter big budget films (don't get me wrong, I love them also) we get during the summer season. Joker is incredible. "
2901," Perfection !!
", An absolute masterpiece and wonderful performance from joaquin. The joker is created for him.the music was awesome i enjoyed the whole time . 
2902," Unapologetic Comic Book Horror Masterpiece
",
2903," A masterpiece
"," I never write reviews about movies, even though I have seen movies where my mind is blown but Joker... it's not just an origin story but a cinematic masterpiece where the storyline, costume design, sound and even the colors were very well executed. Joaquin's acting is definitely Oscar worthy, his performance is what will get him out of the ""underrated"" category. He portrays the essence of Joker and to see how the character came to be was simply marvelous and surprisingly satisfying. Would watch it more than once and I'm not one of those people. 100% recommended. "
2904," DC has taken the right step and comes up with a clear storyline at last
"," So far, the best film I have seen DC has made. So much has been conveyed, within such a little time. Getting a storyline has always been hard for DC, the mixed timelines and the inconsistent story and bouncing between characters has always been a downer. The one character that has always made DC a success was Joker. And this film has lived up to it's name.
The screenplay is one of the best in the recent times. Joaquin phoenix has lived as the Joker entirely. The transformation of Arthur Flex to The Joker, the penultimate movie of the entire DC cinematic universe. It's a must watch for everyone who wishes to side with the Joker.
I would give everything I have up in a heart beat just to see another movie Joker movie made. "

2908," That's exactly why I fell in love with Hollywood
"," A very deep psychological dig into the society's most destructive tool which is the society itself. Gotham, the perfect atmosphere to transform a citizen into the Joker. The movie is about this journey of transformation psychologically and socially. It also digs into the heart and soul of the idea of anarchy.
Epic performance from Joaquin Phoenix, an Oscars worthy.
Mesmerising cinematography.
Outstanding music and soundtracks thanks to Todd Phillips who was extremely successful in every piece he put together to create this masterpiece.<br/><br/>I loved every single shot. "

Inspired in part by 'The Killing Joke' with the focus around 'one bad day can drive anyone mad' we get to watch the amazing Phoenix spiral from unstable into pure madness. Throughout this process you will empathise and despise this character, yet be at the edge of your seat through every moment and corner on this spiral.<br/><br/>An academy award winning performance without a doubt with many deeper concepts that critics and audiences will uncover over time after many viewings.<br/><br/>A film and performance that will be studied for years to comes "
2917," and the oscar goes to...
"," I was considered late for Joker. Has been two days since premiere, spoilers are everywhere and I dodged them like bullets on the battlefield. Stayed in the 9.4 before on the IMDb, not a single thing I dare to read or hear about Joker. I did not wish to ruin my moments with a masterpiece. But I still kept my expectation steady, not to mess up like before.
But, this is truly a masterpiece! Crazy and insane. I was awed for the entire movie. The movie itself is a spectacular solo performance of Joaquin Phoenix. Robert De Niro did support well, but the entire spotlight was Joaquin's. I bet next year Oscar will be his. Who can beat this kind of insanity?
The music score gave a great boost to the movie, it was dark and intense, sent chills down to the spine. The director, also scriptwriter, Todd Philips, another brilliant factor that perfecting this gem. Succesfully delivered how sick and rotten of the Gotham's humanity. Beautiful pictures and cinematography. No scene was wasted.
Spoiler alert : My favourite scene was when Joker standing on the car, using his blood, drew a smile on his face. If you feel me too.
People tend to compare Marvel and DC. For this Joker, nothing comparable actually. It is a different thing. Can't even consider this as a superhero movie. It is a psychological thriller.
Is it merely hype?
No, it is Art (hur).
Me : 10/10 "
2918," Best movie i ever seen
", Oscar movie and acting .... Congrats for everyone who delivered this masterpiece to us ... Joaquim best actor or nothing 
2919," Very good
", Arthur that be a joker rather be a clown. Finally know how joker distort his mind. 
2920," Great movie
"," What a wonderful performance from Joaquin Phoenix in ""JOKER"". An Oscar is coming for him, I bet yes, because he is fantastic, a complet artist. I'm always words, to describe how I feel about this movie I watched today, because I think it's all said. Congratulations to the director for choosing Joaquin for this role. "
2921," Transcending Experience
"," This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Virtuoso performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Just finished watching the movie a few minutes back. My mind is still racing thinking about the movie. It is a deep character study of how Arthur Fleck becomes Joker. He was driven to the edge of insanity and boy does he hit back hard. Gotham with all its lawlessness, corruption, prejudice, and insensitivity is rife for violence. His history is twisted. He feels lied to and is torn between truth and lies. The lack of empathy is something Gotham stinks of. He does not care anymore what is reality and what is fiction. It paints a grim picture of how the world is. It is grounded in reality and therefore one can relate to today's society. The ending is what transcends this movie into greatness. "
2922," an original story of Joker
"," Watched this movie yesterday in Korea.
just stunning.....this is all I can say.
not the best movie tbh, but anyway definitely a must see movie. "
2923," Painfully brilliant
"," It's been two years or more so since a recent movie made me feel that wow factor and I was craving for a performance to amaze me.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is one of the beat actors today but still it seemed it was hard to compete with Heath Ledger's Joker, well this movie is not a competition at all since they feel like completely two different characters but to me this is one of the best performances I've ever seen on a ""commercially"" movie... I'm not expert on comics but I do love good performances and movies, specially deep ones, Phoenix's Joker is a beautiful psychological study on mental disorder, the movie is really intense and there is not a moment that you feel reminded of past Batman movies or Jokers nor do you ever wish for action to start, you just seat watching this really dark story and taking it all in, few movies give that kind of darkness that you can just feel it, Joaquin's performance really blew me away, it's really painfully brilliant. "
2924," So good I plan on watching it a second time.
"," The title says it all. I don't watch movies for a second time because I never saw the point, but for the Joker I really want to. "
2925," Stop calling it a comic book movie - It's a Social Economic Snapshot In Time. PSA: Protect Your Mental Health
"," In a society where bullying is the norm and the poorest people get the least amount of preventative care, Joker is a testament to how, since the days of ""Taxi Driver"" being made, not much has changed. People who are made to feel outcast, people who are scraping to get by and earn food money, people who are alone, ..... often get kicked by an uncaring system. Man's inhumanity to man is alive and well in today's society and in this film. While set in a different decade the message is the same. I don't know what people mean anymore when they say or thing 'comic book movie' because comic books and characters reflect the minds of their creators. Not unlike ""Natural Born Killers"" the media needs to stop making celebrity out of crazy people and those who do harm to others. The fear of the film inciting violence is ridiculous just as it was with ""V for Vendetta"". This is not a children's film and it's not a comic book film, it's a pure Drama. It could not be more well done. Anyone who doesn't walk away with a new perspective on what it is like to be poor in America should reflect. PS: Stop bulling each other people, we are all we have. "
2926," Amazing!!
"," So, let me start by saying that this is a movie I didn't plan on seeing. My husband wanted to see it, so off we went! This movie is beautiful, chaotic, and the cinematography perfect. When Cumberbatch did Kahn, my thought was he was born to play that role. Joaquin Phoenix was not only born to play this role, but he absolutely OWNS the Joker. He was perfect; if he doesn't win at least one award for this movie, something is definitely wrong! This movie kept me engaged, I didn't want to miss a millisecond. Bravo!!! "
2927," Must watch

2931," Splendid!
"," Joaquin Phoenix has delivered the most brilliant performance of His life. He deserves an Oscar. Acting, Direction, Cinematography everything is splendid! Hats off to #ToddPhilips "
2932," What a performance!!!
"," If you are a Joker fan. You will love this movie! This take is very dark, but, it is very well written and the acting is incredible! It will at some point put a smile on your face! "
2933," I WAS BLOWN AWAY
"," I LOVED THIS SO MUCH. Brilliantly shot, Brilliantly written and most importantly brilliantly acted. Phoenix needs his Oscar for this movie. Joker is truly crazy, if Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for this I will truly be shocked, he really went for this and it really shows. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone. It is a MUST see. "
2934," An authentic, psychological masterpiece.
"," This film seems to me so perfect, the cinematography, the camera angles, along with the gritty sickly world depicted and a most interesting colour pallet that creates a psychologically insane scope for viewing. This really put you into the head of Arthur and his disorientated, mentally unstable state. They created a joker so authentic that it's believable what is happening is real, this immerses you into the film all the more which is what a film should do. It's so refreshing to see such a well made character study created in this era. Thankyou Joaquin Phoenix for putting a masterful depiction of this character that is so believable and complex. Scorsese would be proud. "
2935," Visceral watch
"," A great, raw pic describing the origins of the Joker. Although, the homage is greater to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' than to any Batman movie.<br/><br/>A visceral exploration of mental illness and a deep character study facilitated by an emotional and convincing performance by Phoenix.<br/><br/>Overall, very much enjoyed the original take, aided by cohesive storytelling and fantastic performances. Only detracting factor was homage sometimes swayed into plagiarism with remarkable similarities to Taxi Driver. While the film felt like a win for original storytelling it may also have been another victim to Hollywood's plague of remakes and sequels masked by a thin vineer of apparent uniqueness .<br/><br/>Worthwhile watch in 2019! "
2936," Joaquin the king of Gotham
"," I went into the cinema not expecting anything special.We always get the hype for a ""big movie"" release and 9 times out of 10 they never deliver.oh man does this movie deliver.I didn't take my eyes off the screen from start to finish.the story was great and the acting,especially from Joachin Phoenix was phenomenal.the man's got to get an Oscar.thank you for restoring my faith in cinema. "
2937," 'Joker' doesn't let you leave cinema without putting a smile on your face!
"," As a Ledger fan, I am now also a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's - because he is the Joker. They both are.
From his Oscar-worthy (and more) performance of this legendary character, to the cinematography, and dare I say, everything else - the movie is either a 110 out of 100, or nothing. It takes a person who understands what they're watching here to love this movie. This movie is everything to those, who get it, and nothing to those, who don't want to try to understand it. I loved every single scene. It was extraordinary. It was brilliant. 'Joker' is a masterpiece you haven't seen yet.
It is a ''dream come true'' piece of art, something that will leave you wondering for hours, days, and if you're a movie-lover like me - decades. It is that captivating and magnificently beautiful! "
2938," Ignore the critics- watch this movie now.
"," This movie is fantastic, from the superb acting from Phoenix right down to the way the movie really convinces you that Gotham is a living and breathing city that is full of crime and corruption. In this regard, the Joker manages to remind me of Taxi Driver- a movie about one man who is fed up with the world and wants to make a change, no matter the cost. I highly recommend that anyone reading this goes out and watches this movie for themselves before taking one look at critic scores and deciding to give it a pass, because I have a feeling that you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how excellent this movie is. "
2939," Great filmmaking from Todd Philips and astonishing performance from Joaquin Phoenix
"," I left the theatre amazed and thrilled by Phoenix's performance, it really looked liked If Phoenix was joker himself and really took on well with what he was given. This is magic behind filmmaking. Even though I am a Marvel fan I still appreciate what other directors do especially what Todd Phillips has done really. The last 20-30 minutes will blow your brains out It's INTENSE "
2940," Joker is FANTASTIC
"," It was a phenomenal movie, with a tone that DC seem to always get right, wether it's the Dark Knight trilogy or Joker, it delivers again and again. The cinematography is beautiful and Joaquin Phoenix's performance is some of the best acting i've seen in a while. The colours of the film stand out and Robert De Niro shines in the role of Murray Franklin. Todd Philips has really outdone himself with this movie and I very much recommend that you go and see it. "
2941," A true story told from the perspective of a fictional character
"," The Joker movie: A story of a mans slow, spiral decent towards darkness and insanity. It humanizes a hidden evil that exists in American culture, and gives it a face: the mask of a clown. A man filled with S-Laughter: A clever juxtaposition between chaos and commedy to expose our societal nonchalance towards the same hidden evil that we know exists, yet do nothing about it. It is a dark movie that should scare you when you think about this hidden evil as you walk past strangers on a daily basis, unknowing how strong the evil exists inside them. It is the true horror story of Americas yesterday and tomorrow, told from the perspective of a fictional character who luckily will never have to live the story out in reality...Our reality. Many Jokers have lived, and if nothing changes many Jokers will continue to come. God help us all. "
2942," Perfect playing
", Super acting. I need to applaud This acting. the camera is great and the Music City is perfect. it's like acting monitored unutterable masterpiece. 
2943," As good as I was hoping it would be
"," No spoilers here. I just got back from watching joker. I don't understand any of the negative reviews I read previously. This was superb. Phoenix is outstanding and rivals Ledgers Joker for me now (never thought I'd say that).
It's dark, very little humour and to begin with fairly slow but as it played out to its climax I was enthralled and wanted more as the titles rolled ( I'm sure this will set up further films in a new franchise with Phoenix the star)
I highly recommend this movie. "
2944," Astonishing ! ! !
"," Watch it!
Such an amazing actor Joaquin Pheonix is!
Thank you Todd Phillips. "
2945," Brilliant but dark masterpiece
"," Since Nolan's Batman trilogy DC movies haven't lived up to expectations. Man of Steel a slight disappointment, Dawn of Justice even bigger and Justice league was a nightmare. Suicide Squad was hideous. Almost lost my hope.<br/><br/>Today went to see the Joker and it was brilliant. New angle, more loyal to original stories and comics. Very grim, dark and made me feel anxious whilst watching. Something we haven't seen before and Joaquin made a the iconic character his own. Tragic figure that society pushes to insanity.<br/><br/>If the upcoming Pattison's Batman is going to be more grim and crime/thriller/detective themed as some sources have suggested and we get to see Joaquin's Joker in it, then we might see something special.<br/><br/>Joker is a masterpiece. "
2946," Heath Ledger would be proud.
", Heath Ledger would be very proud of Joaquin Phoenix here exceptional performance Oscar worthy! Joker is an incredible film very dark and twisted keeping the audience captivated and on the edge of their seat at all times! I am a huge fan of the character and this film has done The Joker proud. Highly recommend! 
2947," Give that man an Oscar!
"," Revolutionising comic book movies. Left me with my heart pumping, goosebumps and chills throughout. Insanely tense, shocking and unpredictable. No doubt it will do really well come awards season. Perfection. "
2948," Perfectly made
"," It's not about glorifying a monster, it's about a society which creats monsters. "
2949," So powerful
"," You see, hear and feel this film like you rarely do any film. "
2950," Surprisingly good
"," I'm a massive Nolan/Heath/Bale fan and was in two minds about going to see this (especially after the suicide squad version of the joker).
But I was pleasantly surprised.
I went in wanting to hate it, but by the end credits I was almost punching the air. If your after an emotional response - you'll find it here.
Pacing does lag a little in the middle, but picks up nicely towards the end. Didn't spoil my enjoyment.
Critics seem to be split - but I think the negative reviewers are getting caught up in the ""noise"" around this film. Judge it as a film - not a social commentary. "
2951," Phoenix gives a performance of a lifetime!!!
",
2952," A story telling MASTERPIECE!
", I watched this movie last night. This movie is simply a masterpiece. I usually can pick out faults in movies. But not with this one. Acting was excellent! Cinematography was excellent! Writing was EXCELLENT! I was captured from the beginning and couldn't take my eyes off the screen. 
2953," His life is a joke
"," I got down and had a lot of thoughts after the movie. Joaquin was show the mind of criminal who has a complex mind and good heart lived in filthy society
Cannot just put him and Heath Ledger on a scale because they was the best on their ways. The way to show us why this society made people like Arthur become Joker "
2954," Modern Day Taxi Driver
", You will either love it or hate it! There is no inbetween! 
2955," Amazing.
"," Amazing movie, Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors ever and this is his master piece, the director Todd Philips makes an awesome job, besides many people don't trust in him and the photography is beautiful, everything smells Oscar. "
2956," You have to watch the transformation!!!
"," This movie is a slow burn but the lessons you learn from this movie put use them in your everyday life. You are ugly and mean to people and you create these monsters. And when these monsters bite. Society says we dont understand why they act like this. They took his meds, his mother lied to him, they beat him up, and they laughed at him. When he explosives he explosives. You feel bad for him but you know he is doing wrong. But the best line is ""everyone gets what they deserves"" "
2957," Great Movie!
", I think Phillips took an a somewhat avante-garde approach and I loved it! Not everyone Is going to like this movie. Don't come into the movie expecting the typical superhero/villain type BS. 
2958," If you haven't seen this, what have you ever seen?
"," ""You get what you deserve.""
And we as fans deserved this movie.
Before you go into theatres,
Do remember,
celebrate the acting,
not the character.
Yes, the world is getting crazier,
yes people treat each other like trash
and yes,
we expect a mentally ill person to behave as if they don't :') but do remember, we all have a joker inside us, just never let it take over the sane side of yours.
Coming to the movie,
From the starting minute to the very ending,
it was a display of sheer brilliance.
From the acting to cinematography and finally the soundtrack, everything just clicks.
Though people who are thinking it is about the
joker we all celebrate, the one we loved in dark knight, they have to remember that it is an ORIGINS STORY. There are no ifs no buts, there are no big ventures or plans, it is just how the actual concept of joker came into picture, what made a normal person turn against the society and how anyone can be a joker, the clown but they don't have to and also how it all just fits because remember,
that's LIFE.
Stunned.
Overwhelmed.
Enchanted.
All hail the clown prince of Gotham City.

Such a great movie "
2960," A near perfect direction for the Joker !
"," Quite simply an outstanding film, I'm no film critic but this is the highlight film of 2019 and the portrayal of The Joker is right up there, if not beyond where the character has been taken before! "
2961," Masterpiece
"," It is a very disturbing movie I left the theater hour ago and still speechless , Phoenix is magnificent , we saw the development of the joker and how Thomas Wayne created joker and joker created batman "
2962," Cinema at its finest!
"," Joker is an absolute masterpiece that I believe will never be forgotten. Joaquin Phoenix did an astoundingly amazing performance. Even though there is no main conflict or plot in the movie, the character study and the character development is truly horrifying and disturbing. The cinematography is also something that will be worth the watch, the colour palette definitely sets the tone for the mood of the film. Overall, this masterpiece is disturbing, horrifying and definitely worth the watch. Every single scene in this movie is perfect and I'm not even exagerating. "
2963," A Contemporary Masterpiece
"," The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, Arthur Fleck, allows the viewer to deeply understand the frustration and pain carved into the heart of a corrupt and unequal society member, that struggles to be accepted by others because of his distorted view of life. As the movie develops itself through the analysis of a chaotic city and the construction of a melancholic soundtrack, the character praises the need of happiness and to make people laugh, but that desperate need of laughter and joy turns Fleck into something new, the leader of an anarchy that is taken as The Joker. "
2964," AMAZING MOVIE!!!
", Great Joaquin! Thinking about you Joker. What a legendü§°ü§°ü§°ü§° 
2965," Love the game rain

2966," Masterpiece
"," I went in with mid level expectations, but even with high with expectations, I still feel like this movie would have exceeded them. It was great across the board; direction, cinematography, screen play and a really masterful performance by the main actor. Very impressed and inspiring as a example of artful yet accessible filmmaking. "
2967," Astonishing, chilling, terrifying. Joaquin Pheonix brings the Joker to life.
"," I've waited a very long time to see and review this film. Let me start off I understand the controversy around this film. This is a very intense, dark film for mature audiences. It gives you a very deep and dark look into the mind of a mentally ill man who is rejected by society and becomes a homicidal villain. Joaquin Pheonix, who in my opinion gave the greatest performance I've seen in a very, very long time, brought the Joker to life. It is so hard to word how I feel after walking out of this film. The way Joaquin portrayed this character just left me speechless. I actually was uncomfortable at moments. Without giving anything away to the plot, Joker was rollercoaster that gave me a different perspective on comic book films. The acting was absolutely amazing, the score was just WOW! Whoever composed it definitely deserves recognition. I DO NOT I repeat DO NOT believe this movie is suited for immature audiences and believe parents should not let their kids see this film until they have a mature mindset. To me this film was one of the greatest films ive seen and has entered my top 10 list. Not sure exactly where it stands yet but it is in that list for sure. "
2968," Brilliant
"," The way the characters and the city of Gotham plays out jokers psychology is just beautiful, and then there is Joaquin. Don't forget to smile "
2969," Very Good Movie!
"," I loved this movie! It was VERY DARK. But with that being said, it was very good! Entertaining from start to finish! "
2970," Wow just wow
"," This film is freakin fantastic. Before seeing the movie I just expected it to be a pretty decent movie but I'm just in shock about what I just saw. If you want your jaw to drop and your heart to race you have to see this film. Such fantastic acting from Joaquin, you actually believe he's the real life joker. "
2971," No spoilers. This years must see! Amazing in so many ways
"," A darker more grounded and realistic take on the joker and Gotham really allow the viewer to become entangled in the narrative and truly feel like they have entered the world. Amazing storytelling that really draws you in from the beginning right to the very last minutes. Amazing movie, acting and writing. Gave an amazing insight into what the people of Gotham face. Joaquin was absolutely amazing and definitely one of, if not the best example of the Joker so far. His take on the Joker is very different then what we've seen before but in such great ways. Infact his portrayal of the Joker is definitely deserving of an oscar. Best movie I've seen in a long time and probably the best I'll see in a long time in today's crazy climate. It's my favorite movie of the year so far and I'd say absolutely a must see! "
2972," Excellent acting
"," I did not expect much when I watch a DC movie but this movie is in the league of the likes of Logan, Batman Trilogy. Joaquin Phoenix, wow, he did not left a lot of impression on me in his past movies but I heard most of the movies he participated won Oscar, this guy must have a knack for spotting good one, especially one that helps him showcase his acting. I left the theater crying after Joker's laugh, he keeps laughing but I don't know why there's such a sad feeling. Who could have portrayed a better Joker than this. 10/10 "
2973," A must see
"," For those of you looking for a dark comic book tale, this isn't it. When you go into this film don't look at it as the story of a famous comic book villain. Look at it as a story about a man dealing with mental illness in a troubling time. Joaquin Phoenix gives the performance of a lifetime and there are a number of times the movie will leave your jaw on the floor. This is a must watch, but if you are looking for a typical feel good happy comic book story then this isn't the movie for you "
2974," Masterpiece
", I don't have the words in my vocabulary to describe the perfection that is this movie. Phoenix has mastered every aspect of the Joker and Phillips' direction was mesmerizing. 
2975," Catharsis
"," You know that moment when you have so much to say, but no words to say what you need to say? You feel the emotions running through your limbs at a rate that's faster than you can handle, so you lose your balance. You try to stand tall, and gather your thoughts, but your legs go limp, and your body grows weak. ""I need a moment""... that's what he said, as we drove home in the silence of the rain, contemplating the moment that we just shared. "
2976," Critics are kinda funny, aren't they?
",
2977," One of The Darkest Films *EVER* Made; A Masterpiece
",
2978," Phoenix and Phillips deliver compelling, mature work.
"," Oh yeah, it's good. As a psychological study, it's a tad Hollywood, but as a comic book movie, it's something very unique indeed.
Probably the least surprising thing about the movie is Joaquin Pheonix's performance as Arthur Fleck; given his immaculate, decade long streak of complex, damaged characters.
But it would be a disservice to not praise what is quintessentially a make or break the movie role that Phoenix devours with every ounce of talent he possess. It is amazing!
But the real left field surprise comes from director Todd Phillips (most notable for the Hangover trilogy), who continues what has become something of trend for bad comedy directors (among them Peter Farrelly's Green Book and Craig Mazin's Chernobyl). Dishing out mature, genuinely affecting character dramas seemingly, from out of nowhere. "
2979," Todd Phillips created a MASTERPIECE
"," I have never written a review for iMDB before, but this film made writing one necessary. This is one of the most intelligent, raw, and eye-opening movies I've ever seen. Though dark, brooding, and gory, every decision made by Phillips in this film was necessary. This film serves as a mirror to society and tackles controversial, relevant topics that need the spotlight, especially mental health. Phoenix's performance was one of the best I've seen in a long time, taking the cake over Ledger in my opinion. I loved seeing a new take on the comic-book genre. This film is a MASTERPIECE. "
2980," Brilliant, devastating, humbling.

2981," First DC movie i fell inlove with
"," Amazing movie, sign me up for a sequel. There have been too many great marvel movies and joker is one of the movies that can top that. "

2985," I AM IN SHOCK.
"," In all my years as a cinephile, I can¬¥t remember the last time I watched a masterpiece like this. Or even better, I can¬¥t remember the last time I saw a performance like Joaquin Phoenix gives us in here: So dark, so atractive, so twisted, so magnificent, so Oscar worthy. I¬¥ve seen all his movies, but this performance is above many others. This film is amazing, but HE is the one who makes it so incredible. This performance will change the cinema history, and will be remembered forever. Jesus, I don¬¥t have other words to describe him, but If you don¬¥t give the award to him, Academy, we will send in the clowns... "

2988," Film of the year
"," This was an absolute master class in both the direction showcased by Todd Philips and the character portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix. The combination of the 2 creates a feeling of unease throughout the film, an eery tension which grows amidst Arthur Fleck's furthering decent into madness. The commitment to the role by Phoenix is absolutely astounding, he both physically and mentally contorts himself into a mold of a man that is slowly losing his grip on reality. I've never felt so compelled to cheer for a character who I know to be irredeemable, albeit worthy of some sympathy. You know what you get when you trust Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix to fulfill the hype for an R rated joker origin film? Exactly what you paid for! This is the best film of the year and my front runner for Best Director and Best Male Lead. A much deserved 10/10. Bravo üëèüèº "
2989," I can't not give this 10 stars
", Joaquim Phoenix did an incredible job. It was mind blowing how well he played this role. The film really blew my mind.<br/><br/>It wasn't a super hero movie with lots of action but it blew your mind with how this man becomes the joker. Well worth it. 
2990," I am Speechless!
"," It's a masterspiece. This movie has it all, the confusion, drama, love, action, mystery, it drives you crazy and emotionally involved. Also such a great cinematography with beautiful composition of colors, great directing from Todd and the acting of Joaquin is speechless, impressive and outstanding. This is the Joker that we needed, it's just simply perfect. "
2991," Excellent movie
"," I often go to see superhero or villian movies. But today I went to see the joker thinking that was the typical movie with a sad villain with family problems and stuff like that, but no, I GOT AMAZED it was spectacular, the acting of Phoenix got me disturbed, it was incredible, I believe it is worth an Oscar and the movie itself was unbelievable, I couldn't stare away from the screen , I never knew what was going to happened and it kept me nervous an exited. 10/10 "
2992," Real
", This film is a masterpiece. I struggle to even categorize this work as it feels like you are watching actual people rather than characters. 
2993," Smile & Put on a Happy Face
"," Disturbing. Twisted. Real. I can't even begin to describe what a masterpiece this film was. The colors and the cinematography were incredible. Notice how his world is colorful and happy when he becomes ""Joker"". Joaquin deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance (definitely a Golden Oscar). Todd Phillips and Phoenix made the character seem so believable; showing how society can change someone. I'm seeing it again tomorrow for sure! "
2994," How much crap can one take before snapping?
", This movie was amazing. You know you've seen a great movie when you know you'll be thinking about the entire story days after you've viewed it. That's exactly what this movie will do. You will be blown away with the depth of the mentality this character has in this study. Do yourself a favor and stop reading the reviews and go watch it. 
2995," Absolute Masterpiece
", Joaquin Phoenix killed it as the Joker. The biggest thing that I felt while watching this movie was the unsettling atmosphere. The ending was terrific and the movie had an overall great pace! 
2996," Amazing
"," Joker was a true masterpiece. One of the years best. Up there with endgame and once upon a time in Hollywood. Huge die hard joker fan for years. This movie did everything I wanted to see out of a joker film. Great set up and character development. 2nd act was a tiny bit slow, but still interesting. The 3rd act was incredibly. Very dark and suspenseful. Had a very well done ending. Phoenix's performance was as good as it gets. Possibly even better than the great Heath Ledger. Very very good movie. Go see it now. Diffinetly an oscar contender. Possibly in my top 10 of movies. Again, breathtaking performance from Phoenix. Perfect film. Really no flaws. Dark gritty and suspenseful. Again, great film. I should stop saying great film. "
2997," Wowww
", Joaquin phoenix what the hell is that? This acting deserves an Oscar 
2998," Critics of this movie do exist?
"," Oh my god! What a movie
What a mind blowing performance by Joaquin Phoenix..
üëåüèªüëåüèª His transformation from an innocent person who just wants to make ppl happy to the king of thugs will definitely blow ur mind away!
Must watch!! "
2999," A truely terrifying dissent into madness
"," As other reviews here have stated this is not your regular superhero action-thriller flick but a gritty character study. Joaquin Phoenix has done an absolutely tremendous job here..from his painful laugh that must have been exhausting to do to his slow dissent into complete madness which unearths how truly broken Arthur is really an incredible feat..You truly feel that he is coming unhinged which just goes to show what an incredible actor Joaquin is and the effort he put into this.. The ending
makes you question certain events and willl leave you discussing this movie for months.. Watch it its a masterpiece! "
3000," Superb acting!
", I will be very disappointed if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get nominated for an academy award and wins as best actor. 
3001," A Magnificent Work of Art
"," Cold, hard and sharp; The film does absolute justice to Ledger's performance. Joker is a film that does not confine itself to the normal comic book genre. It is a character study, giving us an insight to how Arthur turns into the iconic villain Joker that we all love to hate. It takes us to back to 1980s Gotham City which is shown struggling due to massive segregation, crimes and disparity of wealth. With the unfortunate parts of society already on edge, it could just take one little spark to cause a big boom.
Joker makes the viewer some what sympathetic towards the character. And also forces the viewers to think what role do we play in creating such monsters. Joaquin Phoenix carries the whole movie on his shoulders and delivers, which many are calling, an Oscar worthy performance. His performance may send chills down spines for some viewers.
Bottom line is that this is exactly how such a complex character should have been handled and is the perfect origin story that Joker deserved. "
3002," The REAL Joker
"," This portrayal of the character is amazing it shows how Arthur is really broken really messed up and despite all of that he finds joy in destruction, chaos, and himself...he simply is the joker. As he said in the movie I used to think that my life is a tragedy but now I realize, it's a comedy.<br/><br/>One hell of a dark twisted comedy "
3003," A Fresh Reinterpretation
"," In an uncharacteristic masterstroke, Todd Philips (director of Road Trip, The Hangover Trilogy and War Dogs) presents a unique take on the Joker by infusing the real-world tragedies of familial breakdown, abuse, neglect and mental illness into his story arc with sociopolitical unrest and social incivility as a backdrop. In doing so, Joaquin Phoenix's immersive performance gives heart and horror to the underlying nihilistic impulse to ""watch the world burn"" that was missing in the more intellectual ""concept personified"" interpretation by Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger.<br/><br/>While its a sad, violent plunge into psychotic madness may hit home too hard for some viewers, Todd Philips' Joker is a refreshing for its fresh approach that abandons its franchise trappings or Hollywood studio conventions to do something bold and socially relevant despite the gross misinterpretation of critics who think their socially-aware politicos. "
3004," Masterpiece
", AMAZING! One of 1000 movies to watch before you die!(i guess they have to update their list) 
3005," Probably Joaquin Phoenix's best performance
"," I have no words to say, I think this is the best movie from 2019 without doubts. Amazing performance by Joaquin and incredible script and directing from Todd. "
3006," Joker
"," Oscar deserving performance, one of the best acts of 2019. Bravo to Joaquin Phoenix for outsanding performance. "
3007," We all are clowns
", A story of one of the clowns here on this planet shown to you with great direction and acting. 
3008," What a masterpiece.
"," I got very hyped from the beginning till the end when the teaser and trailer dropped for this wonderful movie. And boy, all the hyping was worth it. It is defenitly not an average superhero/villian movie and I got a feeling a lot of audience excepted this exactly what it would be. Personally I think the Joker movie is on some whole new level. Too me it's pure art. The acting, the shots and music created a constant tense feeling. I felt really uncomfortable at the beginning which is a good thing, becauce that's the exact feeling you should get from the Joker. And that's what I meant, mentioning the audience in the theater I was visiting earlier. A lot of people started laughing because they got akward and if that's the effect in a theatre by your acting skills you can say you've done a really, really good job. It's harsh, i'ts raw and you don't know if you should laugh or cry. I got soaked in it from the beginning till the end and I think that everybody who loves the character of the Joker should see this because you'll open your arms and embrace this movie. And if you did, it will get too you and won't let you go for a while. "
3009," A masterpiece
"," Please give him an Oscar he is a true artist I laughed, cried with him "
3010," Put on a happy face!
"," A Dark Story, Outstanding Performances, Background Music, and what not! Joker is a complete package for anyone who wants to experience a complete Dark movie. So put on your happy face and watch this masterpiece. "
3011," Kind of regular in the former part but gets great when the story progresses
"," Performance is definitely very good, this joker is not crazy in a cult god way, but crazy in a very representative way. I like how they process the delusion and reality parts, and I still don't know if joker is the son of Thomas WayneüòÇ. The atmosphere in the former part is not catchy enough, wish the music can be more bizarre and perhaps more first person photography could be used. The depth if the movie is a bit too easy to find, but it's still deep. "
3012," A masterpiece.
"," Just saw the #Joker last night in Bahrain and it sent chills down my spine . I think this is a one of a kind movie , something that should be experienced by all movie lovers . A slow burn into reality which is far more haunting than fiction.It is not a Superhero movie nope .... it is a super villain movie .An honest reflection of how we are all responsible in creating monsters .Simply a masterpiece . Oscars ... yes for sure. "
3013," Woah! What a pleasant SURPRISE!

3014," Very good
", Very good very good very good very goodry good very good very food very good very good 
3015," An instant classic!
"," For the first time in years, I clapped at the end of a movie.
What an actor! What a story! What an epic movie!
The movie got so much hype that I was afraid I raised the bar too high while entering the cinema.
In the end, it was a ten ton slap in the face that I received with a big smile.
What a masterpiece! "
3016," The film that made me go back to IMDB
"," I want people to watch this film. Why? Because Hollywood is ruled by money, not art.
I want this film to succeed so we can have more films like this, instead of ONLY getting dumb eye-candy ALL THE TIME.
I enjoy those dumb superhero movies, I do! I really liked the last 2 Avengers movies, they are lots of fun! But I also like Burger King once in a while, and McDonald's as well, and yet I'm convinced I would die an early death if I were to eat ONLY junk food.
We should have a 70/30 ratio of films/movies, but instead we have a 2/98 ratio right now! What's wrong with this society!?
I watched JOKER last night and almost cried laughing at the revelation that the art of film is not yet dead.
You will hear lots of childish voices telling you that it is {insert a plethora of negative adjectives here}, but that will come from people with an agenda to make you mind-diabetic with junk movies, and mind-enslaved with woke ideas.
Gotham got the hero they needed in The Dark Knight, but JOKER is giving us the film we need right now.
Please support this work of art. Praise Joaquin Phoenix, and praise Todd Phillips, Scott Silver, Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, and Lawrence Sher.
Now going to the movies makes more ""cents"". "
3017," This will go down in History as the Best Joker Movie!
"," I was left speechless after watching this movie! I felt devastated for the Joker! You cannot help but feel a lot of empathy for what happened to him that lead him to become a Villain! This portrayal of the Joker is by far the best and quite Epic! This movie will definitely win a lot of Oscars, starting with best Actor! I can't wait to watch it again! A must watch for all audiences! "
3018," For people who can truly appreciate a masterpiece.
"," This is no ordinary movie, it's a symphony of direction, production, casting, music, acting, all coming together to make one truly amazing cinematic experience. This movie is an EXPERIENCE and should not fall victim to opinions. It's great to have an opinion, just not when you don't know what you're talking about at all. Please do not listen to people who say this movie is bad, just because they don't know what movies are supposed to be like, or because they went in expecting to watch an Avengersesque fest.
This is one of the best movies ever made. "
3019," One of the best peice of work.üòçüòç
"," I have to admit that this is DC's one of the best work so far if not the best, brilliant direction, one of the finest peice of acting and this movie is darker than the dark knight it was obvious to compare this performance with the one done by heath ledger but i must say that Joaquin Phoenix was up there too.It took a little bit to build up the story but the second half was on another level
I'll rate the first half 9.2 but the second half was easily a 9.8 or higher all in all it was a thought provoking movie and everyone will enjoy it.üëçüòç "
3020," One bad day, can make a masterpiece movie.

",
3022," Excellent !!
",
3023," Brutal, vicious and grounded, and is perhaps the path that DC should take with all future adaptations, a disconnected, non-cinematic-universe-binding, standalone story
"," ***Spoilers ahead in what will be a very long read***<br/><br/>First off, let's get this out of the way. This is a not your average comic-book romp with flashy CGI, placed humour (often forced) and grand centerpiece sequences. This a character study rooted deeply in the 70s-80s gritty dramas of which I have personally longed for a return to. It is clear to all, that is a Warner Bros film and not really a DC one from the title card and those who are expecting this film to be a faithful comic book adaptation will be disappointed. Personally, as a huge fan of that section of literature, I went into this film not expecting any lifting from the pages of comics or graphic novels and therefore, absolutely loved the end product. I do however have to state in no uncertain terms, that saying I love this film may be a misnomer on its own, as it is an extremely difficult watch. I felt overwhelmed, a little disturbed and all in all flabbergasted as the credits rolled<br/><br/>Make no qualms about it, true comic-book fans will love this film and will understand that this is an Elseworlds story. Yes, it may be based in parts on the anarchic character (who in my opinion is comicbook-dom's greatest villain surpassing even Darkseid, Doctor Doom et al) whom we have gotten used to in various depictions on-screen. There are a few character traits and plot points lifted from the source material namely the failed comedian angle and the quote ""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy"" (from Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke'), the story taking place from the villain's point of view (from Brian Azzarello's 'Joker') and the climactic riots (from the line in Ed Brubaker's 'The Man Who Laughs' - ""One by nne, they'll hear my call. Then this wicked town, will follow my fall""), however that is where the similarities end<br/><br/>Todd Philips is unapologetic in his clear tributes to various directors from the golden era of cinema. Never are they more apparent in his shot compositions, use of atmospheric music and noir themed cityscapes which harken back to the literary-cum-celluloid musings of Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin, Roman Polanski, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Federico Fellini, Andrei Tarkovsky, Milos Forman and Claude Chabrol. He reserves his absolute homage to Martin Scorsese though, in the storyline and lead character's motivations. To think that the comedic director behind The Hangover trilogy (out of which only the first one was really great), Old School and War Dogs (a little more serious than his prior films) could come up with something this cerebral and violent is almost asinine. He succeeds brilliantly and puts all doubters to shame. It is set in the late 70s, early 80s Gotham City (analogous to the New York City of the same decade) where the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. There is a garbage strike, rats are abound in the city and crime is rampant. Gotham City is descending into a hellhole and many of its nondescript residents are its biggest victims<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is an arresting presence, the focus throughout the film and he reels you in from the first frame of the film where we first meet Arthur Fleck. We see him sitting in front of a mirror and applying his clown make-up. He attempts to put on a smile and resorts to holding the corners of his mouth as a single tear rolls down his cheek unbeknownst to him, all the while disrupting his make-up with it. This single scene sets the tone for the film. How a carefully, regimented fa√ßade is disturbed and ultimately destroyed by a simple action. There is no costume or monologues, just a man. A sad clown<br/><br/>Phoenix's gaunt and often emaciated appearance is scary (you can't help but wonder what he had to do to get in this ""shape"") and evokes memories of Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman from 'American Psycho'. He contorts his frail, spindly frame and on occasion breaks out into a frighteningly joyful, Kabuki-esque dance that is mesmerizing. Phoenix is in his absolute element, and proves once again why he is one of his generation's greatest actors. He portrays Fleck as one of life's victims, a freak to everyone else but someone who is constantly pushed down until he finally snaps. He is mocked, beaten up and often misunderstood by even those closest to him. Phoenix revels in showing pain in each and every sinew of his fibre, his eyes are haunting and hollow, his physicality is precise in the way he walks, sits, smokes or when he shrinks into the shadows. Fleck's hyena-like cackle is uncomfortable and painful and is attributed to Pseudobulbar Syndrome in the film but fits in very well with the overall narrative. You start to sympathize for Fleck but it soon turns from one of affinity similar to the ones we felt for the lead characters of 'Serpico' or 'Dog Day Afternoon', to one of pity that is more akin to the lead characters from 'Taxi Driver', 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'. His damnation begins with one after another ""bad day"" and ends in a brutal, violent and utterly savage actions<br/><br/>Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Brett Cullen, Frances Conroy and the rest of the cast are pretty much just supporting characters and they appear for a miniscule amount of time. They however perform well, De Niro especially, channeling his very own Rupert Papkin from 'The King of Comedy'. On the technical side, the film is littered with masterful brilliance. Scott Silver who co-wrote the film with Phillips utilizes simple but ultimately chilling dialogues to considerable effect. Lawrence Sher delivers a career best cinematography wherein his wide angle and close up shots were both immersive and introspective (especially on IMAX). I also have to give a very big kudos to composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, whose haunting theme, musical cues and overall soundtrack choice work perfectly throughout the film. This should be her big breakthrough and I foresee a lot of awards for her in the future<br/><br/>There are a few drawbacks namely the fisting of certain characters from the larger Gotham universe which no doubt was done to appease the so-called modern comic-book fan. I for one felt that it was unnecessary as they could have been named anything else and it would not have made a dolt of difference in the end product. There is also a worry that the film glorifies incels who resort to violence, but then again, anyone with a sane mind would be able to differentiate real and reel life<br/><br/>Joker has already won a few awards in its fledgling run, including the Leone d'Oro (Golden Lion for Best Film), Graffetta d'Oro (Audience Award for Best Film), Premio Soundtrack (Best Score) and an 8 minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival with Phoenix also winning the Tribute Actor award at the Toronto International Film Festival. This augurs well for the film's Academy Awards chances as the last two winners ('The Shape of Water' &amp; 'Roma') both went on to win Best Picture at the Oscars. Joaquin Phoenix alongside Jake Gyllenhaal is one of my favourite actors who often win plaudits for their performances but not awards. In my opinion, Phoenix should be a shoo in for a Best Actor nomination joining Leonardo DiCaprio (for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'), Taron Egerton (for 'Rocketman') and potentially Adam Driver (for 'Marriage Story') as well as Christian Bale (for 'Ford v Ferrari')<br/><br/>To compare this Joker with Mark Hamill's playful menace (from the animated series and several animated films), Heath Ledger's chilling anarchist (from 'The Dark Knight') or even Jack Nicholson kitschy gangster (from 1989's 'Batman') would be superfluous (I purposefully chose to ignore the meth-head emo dude that Jared Leto plays in 'Suicide Squad'). This is an origin story for ""A"" Joker not ""THE"" Joker and that is how we should evaluate the film. As the Clown Prince of Crime himself once said, ""If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice""<br/><br/>In this film, the Joker is someone who lets his mental illness get the better of him and essentially leads him into what he feels is justifiable violence. This Joker is born of our apathy, we made him and we deserve him</div>"
3024," Joaquin Phoenix steals the show with amazing acting.
"," Joaquin Phoenix steals the show in this beautifully crafted show. From storyline, direction, acting to post-production everything was handled really well.<br/><br/><br/><br/>there is gore violence in the movie, but at no point is it unnecessary or not a part of the story. it speaks to the character's development and gives us a glimpse into the mental state of ""Joker"". at the end of the movie, you could be forgiven for feeling sorry for Joker and all those who oppress us. No wonder US Police Department issued advisories to local state departments to guard the area outside movie theatres.<br/><br/>It is a must watch, even if you have no idea of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Batman. There is a small overlap with Batman and the Wayne family, but you will be able to understand the movie even if you don't have knowledge of Batman Universe "

It's out Oct. 4, but it's already gotten rave reviews from critics and film festival audiences. In September, Joker took home the Golden Lion top prize at the Venice Film Festival. That's no surprise since a week earlier, it got an eight-minute standing ovation from festival audience members who watched an early screening.<br/><br/>""As the mentally ill and socially ignored Arthur, Phoenix burns a hole in the screen,"" our CNET reviewer Rich Trenholm writes.

3027," A chef d'oeuvre of the modern origin story of The Joker
"," A chef d'oeuvre of the genre, Todd Phillips kills it by directing the most compelling and gripping Joker in recent years.
A showpiece showcasing Joaquin Phoenix as a master of his craft delivering more than an award worthy performance and giving the audience a version of The Joker we didn't know we wanted until now. From the unique cinematography and the tone , down to the haunting score this movie packs an unconventional origin story you shouldn't miss. "
3028," A Masterpiece That Deserves Multiple Viewing
"," I was fortunate enough to watch this movie on 2 October on an IMAX. And boy.... the movie surely lived up to its hype and humongous expectations. If Heath Ledger was menacing and mesmerizing as Joker in The Dark Knight, Joaquin Pheonix is that unstoppable force that gives us the Joker that we all truly deserved. You will feel his pain , his sorrows , his dreams , his anger... you will become .. the Joker. The movie got a standing ovation at the end. In fact, I got so much into the character, that I could correctly guess what the Joker's reaction would be , in couple of crucial scenes. This is what Tod Phillips and Joaquin Pheonix have achieved. Finally, this movie does not glorify violence and anarchy, it just shows what happens when you push certain people beyond certain boundaries. "

3030," best joker ever

Joaquin Phoenix deserve oscar
The whole story is very inspiring "
3031," Almost fall asleep
"," Most plots in the film you see it miles away, like joker's mom that joke is Wayne's son, joker kill talk show host and the relationship joker have with a black girl is nothing but an illusion. The whole story is really blatant and flat, whole tension inside the story was build only by loud music. Almost fall asleep during the film. If you have watched any of the movie trailers you have already see the whole film. "
3032," Phenomenal
"," Joker is an absolute game-changer for the superhero genre and the movie industry in general. Gritty, insightful and stunning, Joker is by far the film of the year, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves to run home with the best actor Oscar come February. "
3033," Absolutely art
"," This movie is beautiful. There wasn't one scene I thought was useless and the cinematography was absolutely stunning, dark yet vibrant. "
3034," The DCEU has found its savior
"," Never before have I seen something so game changing in a movie. The crowd was just losing their collective minds the second it started to roll. Just imagine a film that combines the best elements of Avengers, Dressed to Kill, 12 Years A Slave, UHF, Cassablanca, Black Panther, the series Justified, and Wild Things yet remains at its core a hard R girl gang film and that is your culture cinematic event that will forever change how you experience the theater. That is what we can expect from Birds of Prey. I guess Joker was alright too, but all anybody could think about was that Birds of Prey trailer at the beginning. I mean, it was simply glorious. "
3035," Horrific disappointment. Worst movie of 2019 hands down
"," I went into this movie without watching trailers or hearing gossip about it. I wanted to see this rendition with a clear mind and appreciate it. Unfortunately, no amount of open mindedness could prepare me for the insane boredom that was this film. I have never in my life wanted to leave a movie because it was so bad. It drug on and on for what seemed like 4 hours and I was ready to go after the first 30 minutes. The one and only reason I stayed was because I did not buy the ticket, it was a gift.<br/><br/>
But hey, everyone likes different things so if you enjoy comically long scenes with nothing but an insane man laughing or you really like movies that are a 100 on the boredom scale, then this is perfect for you! "
3036," Actor amazing for mentally depressed sick people

Do you enjoy other people getting tortured? Do you feel you are mentally I'll?
Do you enjoy blaming others what ever the reason?
Or you just want to get depressed ?
Or lets say you dont know how to waste your 2 hours !!!
For those who loved the psychologically mental film , admit yourself asap to a mental hospital!! "
3037," This is not joker.
", Why do they need to change a character that we already loved very much? 
3038," Good acting from Phoenix, not so great of a movie
"," Stand alone, with no prior Batman knowledge: this film is probably closer at an 8 or 9. My major problem is they tried too hard to make you side with Joker. To justify everything. To understand him. And I don't think his first murders (the ones that started him down the path, guys on the subway) were completely unjustified. The only one that you couldn't really side with was when he killed the other clown. This doesn't fit the Joker from every other description of him. He's supposed to just be an insane murderous clown who wants to watch the world burn. You're not supposed to understand him or side with him. It wasn't dark and twisted enough to be a good Joker origin movie. It was all just too cliche and predictable. Bullied semi-oedipal outcast turned murder. There's a better orgin story than that for Joker. Joker wouldn't have been created by situations that everyday people deal with. That monster was born and molded by something way more sinister. Also, Batman was never able to figure out Joker's identity. This movie makes it easy for Batman to figure out who he is. "
3039," A solid film. Over hyped.
"," Is the film great? Yes. Does it redefine the comic book genre in a big way? Not at all. This ISN'T a comic book film in any way. In fact if the film wasnt called Joker the film wouldn't change at all. So to say it redefines something it isn't is redundant. Phoneix is amazing and does deserve an Oscar as the acting is outstanding. However, the story forces itself forward.<br/><br/>
Gotham in the 80s is a horrible city full of horrible people. So when 3 rich people die, would the entire city turn to rioting? When people are probably getting murderer left, right and centre. There are no witnesses to the initial murders yet everyone knows its a clown.<br/><br/>Arthur then does some bad stand up which someone how makes it on to national TV. As a one of it seems like a stretch but to then invite him on the show?<br/><br/>Arthur was abused heavily as a child and his mother was locked away in a precursor to arkham asylum. How Arthur ends up back living with her is never explained. Probably because they couldn't find a reason why it would happen.<br/><br/>
So
Is it a good film? Acting wise its superb, story wise it's a bit wishy washy.<br/><br/>Is it a good comic book film??No<br/><br/>Is it a good Joker film? No. As amazing as Phoneix is, this is probably the least Joker ish film I've ever seen and therfore the worst joker. Even worse than Letos. This joker is just a broken man and who is clearly mentally ill. This character poses zero threat to Batman.<br/><br/>If if wasn't for the acting is score the film lower. "
3040," I will keep it short and sweet
", The acting was great. The movie is long and drown out boring. The first hour and a half of the movie could have been told in 20 minutes. Very disappointed. 
3041," TOTAL WASTE OF TIME

Last night I watched dear Heath run his dance as Joker and wonderment of it all - how damn good he was. So tonight I walked into a brick wall. EVERYONE says magnificent. Better than CITIZEN KANE and such tripe. Me? Bored, after 20 min of just bleak - nothing positive. I am moving right now and that is enough stress so I wanted entertainment - and WHOA was this one off base. Walked out after 20 min and I don't care a damn what happened to Joker. Penguin would be more interesting by a yard mile. I am sorry folks - disagree with all of you. Piece of junk. "

3044," So boring!!!
", Okay jaquin Phoenix did a really good job acting and the movie is really artsy but the worst version of Joker I've ever seen even worse than Jared Leto. very limp wristed and sorry excuse for a joker I felt like I was watching the origin story for Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs

3049," Depressing movie
"," This is a movie that I want to forget.
The most disgusting and psychopathic movie I have ever watched.... :[ "
3050," not an action eoic
"," I found this movie as slow drama, the funny parts are: the dwarf cant reach the lock on the door to leave, and the ending, where he is interviewed by Maury. Other than that, this isn't a real edge of your seat action film. The movie is mostly a prologue to joker before batman. It would be interesting to see a better film come out of this, with LOTS of action with joker being Diabolical! "
3051," Shallow imitation of Taxi Driver / King of Comedy
"," This movie is a note for note rip off of Taxi Dirver and King of Comedy, only it is utterly lacking in substance. "
3052," Wonderful performance by Phoenix, dark/gritty sets and cinematography, but...
"," For me, movies ultimately rise or fall based on the strength of the story, plot and dialogue. I'll also say that (again, for me) the Joker as a character - be it onscreen or in comic books/graphic novels - tends to work best when the character is used sparingly, along with the motivations leaning toward psychotic yet focused disruption and the origins being unexplained.
Well, 2019's JOKER lays everything bare in this Joker-centric (centric to the point where it is all Phoenix/Joker to the virtual exclusion of anything else) flick, although Phoenix doesn't complete the transformation into what we traditionally recognize as the Joker until very late into the 2 hour film. Which makes sense, because ultimately this is an origin film, yet by taking such a lengthy look at what made the Joker the way he is all the mystery is removed.
What JOKER boils down to is a long, grimy look at a middle-aged man suffering from mental illness who can't hold a job, has aspirations of fame yet possesses no discernable talents to achieve the popularity he craves, has a friendless/sexless existence, lives with his mother, is mistreated by society, goes off his meds and eventually explodes murderous rages. The awe one may have held previous Joker incarnations such as 2008's The Dark Knight - where the Joker's actions have degrees of malevolent brilliance - is totally absent here. There's certainly nothing in JOKER to ""root"" for, unless one holds ""I've been wronged by society and life has screwed me over"" spree killers in high esteem, so the climatic scenes come off as pathetically repellent. JOKER here is a sad-sack loser to be, at best, pitied. There's no wit or intelligence behind his malevolence here.
3 stars, and solely for Joaquin Phoenix, who certainly throws himself completely into the role and amply demonstrates his superior acting ability. Unfortunately, the ability he brings and the effort he expends is in service of a rather pointless undertaking. I'm a big fan of the Joker as a character, but not the way he was written here. I'm also a big fan of Phoenix, and while he does have the ability to elevate material that isn't up to his talents even an actor of his caliber can only elevate a poorly constructed plot so high. "
3053," dud
"," First this movie was not true to the comics which if it were written that way the storyline would have been more interesting to watch. Next, Joaquin had very big shoes to fill, I applaud him for his attempt at the Joker but his performance fell short. The movie is hard to watch if you are expecting any resemblance of the Dark Knight trilogy. This movie is more a real gritty look at a man struggling with mental illeness with no charm of any of the past Jokers. "
3054," Overrated
", Why so many 10 star reviews?! I feel like it's the same person giving 10 star reviews over &amp; over. No way there are this many idiots out there. I almost feel asleep several times. This movie was awful. Not even worth a dvd rental in my opinion. Maybe you have to have a mental illness to understand this movie. I don't get it. The whole movie was garbage from beginning to end. 
3055," Very slow, boring and depressing movie
"," I had high expectations from this movie considering the past history of Joker's character, however this turned out to be waste of my time and money. "
3056," Trash...
"," Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? Here is the question. Except that in my mind there is no question. 100% Heath Ledger. And here is the reason why: while Ledger was perfect comic book character, Phoenix' character is more disturbing version of Joker. He is mentally ill and seriously needs help. I don't say that Ledger's joker wasn't crazy, He was somewhat crazy but in that movie everything is done in a way that we know it's comic book movie, good versus bad and that's it. 2019 Joker is more disturbing. There is a lot of emotion put in this movie which one would say is good thing but it's done in such manner that somehow we feel sorry for character and somehow even justify his actions. Violence is never the answer. No matter how bad your life is or how many people have hurt you, it is never an option. However, the creators of this movie seem to think differently. There you can hear triumphant music playing when Joker killed all those people. Also, movie is a shock value, unoriginal and uninspiring. The Dark Knight was really interesting movie to watch, everything was somewhat coherent in there. In Joker we have a lot of dancing, laughing, killing and mental breakdowns. To sum up - it's trash. "
3057," Boring and simple and predictable...
"," Far away from The Dark Knight, in a bad way. JP acting is ok, nothing amazing, too mechanic. Honestly, he didn't have much of a script to play with. Heath Ledger acting/script/philosophy is a masterpiece by comparison. The violence is meh, not that it was required but I was told that it was at least gory. If this had gore in it then Watchmen was the most violent movie ever. Shame... 3/10 and those 3 point are for JP performance. "
3058," Not worth the hype ..
"," Leading up to the films release it had high expectations and if im honest i was quite disappointed with the film, i felt like the storyline was pretty good and the acting although the long and boring execution of it is what killed it for me "
3059," Oh no......
"," I was thrilled that we are finally getting a dark and gritty dc story,i am a big fan of Nolan's Batman, but this movie is the most boring and pretencious piece of trash i have seen in years. Acting was good, so what? I've seen million of films with good actors,that doesn't mean the movie is good. You literally have 3 scenes (each 3 minutes long) that are kinda cool but they are quickly lost in a two hours long hipster trash of a movie. Don't pay for it, wait for the ""bluray"" (yeah, nobody's gonna buy this film because it has no replay value ). People calling this a masterpiece are obviously paid commenters, or just dumb people . "
3060," Bad story line Joaquin Phoenix's Star OUTSHINES ALL
"," Joaquin Phoenix performance was beyond GREAT! He alone should get an Oscar nod for his portrayal of a psychotic young man on the brink of destruction and his fall into madness.<br/><br/>Problem in my view that I had was that after all the character development there was no real catalyst that had him pull in the strings that made Society go mad. If confronting Thomas Wayne was the defining moment who/what was the tie-in to the individual killing the Waynes as they left the proverbial theater? Shouldn't there have been more hooks with his Underworld networking? Shouldn't there have been more flashbacks relating to his abuses and/or his Mother's relationship? What happened to the tragedy of his 'Permanent Smile'? Where are there any threads for 'Pennyworth'?<br/><br/>Idk, the Acting was BRILLIANT, INSPIRED but I believe the story line fell short of being INTRIGUING or even ENTICING causing me to want for more. ....<br/><br/>Movies like the 'Bat' series are now taking on a Genre distinctively all their own, but the 'Origins' need MORE ""Tie-ins' or better 'Hooks"" to make us leave the theatre 'WANTING"" for the next before wondering where are you going with this story.

Do i really look like a guy with a plan? I think this movie writer take this words seriously,, u can't take joker's words seriously.

"," I really enjoyed this film, the cinematography, score, acting, everything was very very good. Joaquin Phoenix' performance is certainly Oscar worthy, the casting for this movie was almost perfect.
The cinematography was extremely satisfying as we focus on the development of one character. the Joker, each and every shot was executed incredibly well. Wow. The score was impeccable, each and every scene had fantastic sound which made it really enjoyable to watch.
From start to finish there was not one dull moment throughout the entire film, Todd Phillips has created a masterpiece, I highly recommend seeing this film NOW. Otherwise you're missing out. "
3090," The best movie for a decade
"," In a time when popcorn movies rule (and make no mistake, I enjoy those too) this is the exception. Every single aspect of this movie is astounding - acting (especially the acting - all hail Joaquin Phoenix), the music (I'm listening to it now - something I rarely do for movie soundtracks), the lighting, the sets - everything.<br/><br/>Watch it. Then watch it again. In the cinema both times.<br/><br/>But a gentle warning - it's not a superhero movie, it's not light, it's not especially fun (although there are some amusing moments), and it requires some concentration, but you will be captivated.

", Outstanding acting by Phoenix. Leftists and the liberal media hated this movie and that's why it only got a 68% on rotten tomatoes. Listen to the people and go see it yourself. If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for his performance it'll be because of the the intolerant left. They desperately wanted this movie to tank and it didn't go their way. 
3093," Good Acting but the story misses the mark.
", The lead actor does wonderful job but the script is drawn out and padded in the first half. It... drags... and only gets to a realistic pace in the last 30 minutes. Plus it messes badly (and unrealistically) with the reboot of the origin story. It's almost as if they're trying to spin Joker as an anti hero like Punisher at times and that's just not canon. 
3094," Joaquin kills it!
"," From a DC point of view it is not a well conceived movie, but as psychological drama it really is absorbing up untill the end. The ending messes the story up. The slooow build up to becoming Joker is spoiled by the last scene of the movie, where it feels like Todd Philips had a change of heart. Too bad really "

3100," Mixed Feelings
"," Was waiting a year and a half for this movie. First off, great acting, visuals, and cinematography I liked seeing how the joker transformed into being the joker. My only problem is we didn't get to see the joker until the very end of the movie. I wanted to see the joker in action. They should have added another hour to the movie to show what kind of style of joker, Arthur was going to be, and then ended it the same way they did. "
3101," A bit unrealistic but Joaqin was marvelous
"," First of all, Joaquin Phoenix acting was on top lever throughout the movie. The thing that was unsatisfactory were some holes i couldn't withstand. Those were the little things that made my experience worse and made me think a lot of the things that happened in the movie were unrealistic in a way. I know its cinema its very hard to make movie to everyone's liking, but i would like to mention what should have been done better:
1. Hes going crazy and has many issues cause of all the life hardships hes been trough but there is on signs of hes villainy intelligence hes famous for. There is no signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or any brilliance whatsoever, hes a bit slow, kind of stupid at the moments, and you cant imagine him leading and manipulating like Joker should. There is just no signs that he can develop towards that character.
2. The scene in gunfight, there is no shot of him reloading, or doing that in a sort of panic, and he just shot to many shots.
3. I don't mind Wayne being portrayed as classical politician and man of power that kind of lost sense, but the way he died is just plain stupid, i mean such a wealthy family has no bodyguards or security, it just ain't right.
3.The same unrealistic thing is he managing to get gun to studio, or how, after he killed the most famous tv face, he was arrested by just 2 policemen and put in police car with litteraly no escort ? And how he managed to get so many people to lead him just after he sad like few words and went mental on De Niro, i mean.. come on.
4. After all that at the end they let him(as known madman) kill another woman in secured mental facility just for some sort of crazy admiration towards the character at the end.
5. This movie would be rated much, much worse if there were no Phoneix in it, and there is no words to describe how good he was, he literally dominated the character hes been given. But that character could never become a real Joker or at least no matter how hard they tried they simply haven't assured me to think that he could really become one... "

Now, let's talk about the movie.
Mind blowing. That's what I'll describe it as. The movie carefully pieces together a great, dark, mad world for the Joker. All of it feels so real, it's almost frightening. The script even goes out of the way to highlight the complete cycle of crime in Gotham, which is truly remarkable. And the acting. Where do I start. Be the judge yourself l, better yet. Also, Robert De Niro is a sight to behold in his role as a talk show host. The final act is complete mayhem and a fitting crescendo to the orchestra that is the Joker. DC fans won't be disappointed.

"," I always wonder when i watch a superhero movie, what might have caused the guy to become a villain. This movie is the perfect answer to the question why joker was the joker you saw on the dark Knight saga. I never another director could pull it off but they did.
In the beginning you get a feeling that the directors relies heavily on the actors ability to act, but as the movie progresses you find that the direction actually complements the acting skills. The subtle detailing in almost all the scenes is yet another positive of the movie. The first few minutes of the movie tries hard to get your attention, but when it succeeds to grab your attention you will be on the edge of your seat. Its definitely a masterpiece.
The direction and screenplay competes with one another. Both exceeds your expectations.
The cast is another plus. Actor has done wonders.
The story perfectly connects the dark Knight saga. It even makes you want to see the dark Knight again. A special psychological drama that gives you almost everything that you expect from it.

3122," Let's put a smile on that face üôÇ
",
3123," No ""masterpiece"" here.
"," I don't know why this movie is called Joker, it isn't really about the Joker. It is a movie about a man named Arthur who has mental issues and is constantly being s*** on by society. He has a job as a clown and loses that due to a jerk co worker and after that life just continues to go to hell for Arthur. Around about the last 15 mins of the movie, Arthur paints his face, dyes his hair green and I guess this is when he is supposedly the Joker now but all I was seeing was Arthur in face paint fully having lost his mind now.<br/><br/>This movie was not needed, I went in with low expectations because I felt, much like Venom last year, this film wasn't really needed and it didn't tell an interesting enough story about the Joker. It's really just about an anorexic guy with mental problems who likes to parade around his apartment in nothing but his underwear and break out into a dance routine every five minutes. Then he becomes a lukewarm Joker in the last 15 mins. of the movie. So if that sounds interesting, then you will love this ""masterpiece"". "

3127," A poor man's Taxi Driver
"," Whatever story or message this tries to tell, it largely fails at. Make no mistake about it, this is NOT a Joker movie. This is a movie that is 2 hours long, feels like 4, has Joaquin Phoenix laughing awkwardly throughout all of it, and the title character only shows up in the last 20 minutes of the movie. Not only that, but Christ is it repetitive. We get it, it sucks to be Arthur Fleck, he's clearly not mentally sound, and it seems like the world is out to get him. The problem, is that the movie focuses on this for way too long. To the point of lunacy. It's because of this, that whatever message it tries to tell, is undone by repetition, awkward laughter, awkward dance sequences, and a story that largely goes nowhere. Remember in Spider-Man 3 how Venom was only in the last 20 minutes of the movie? That is this movie.<br/><br/>And don't give me the ""This is an origin story"" excuse either. Batman Begins was an origin story, Spider-Man was an origin story, even Wonder Woman, was an origin story. You know what they all had that this movie doesn't? A plot. And it didn't take them the better part of half a century to get going. This is NOT Taxi Driver, this is NOT Fight Club, this isn't even the movie the trailer makes it out to be. This is someone getting s#!t on for 2 hours, and he happens to become a guy named Joker for 20 minutes of it. Oh, and he also shoots De Niro in the head during a ""we live in a society, bottom text"" speech that isn't nearly as impactful as it sounds, because it hasn't earned it.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie are good, funny, suspenseful, but not many. I give Phoenix some credit, he tries in this, but he can't overcome a script that holds down the true nature of the title character. This is NOT a 10/10 movie, not by a long shot. And I guarantee, that most of the ""reviews"" putting this above far better movies are either fanboys, tryhards, meme lords, or they don't know the potential of movies like this. This is a poor man's Taxi Driver, a poorer man's Fight Club, and for me, a failure.<br/><br/>Laugh at that. "

Go watch this Masterpiece of a movie. that is nothing but brilliant! "
3130," A punch to the face!
"," This is not a movie, it's an experience! Everybody should watch it for so many reasons! Watch it without political views or ideologies! Just watch it as a human being and make a deep reflection about everything you've done our cold do to another human being! This movie reflects our society at it's worse and we all feel a little ""joker"" while watching it! The soundtrack and photography are just another characters to the movie! It is a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time! Joaquin Phoenix is just incredible! "
3131," I really masterpiece
"," It was a long time, but finally a good movie after years.
And I think is one of the most amazing movie in this year, if dc still goes in this way, it will be a very good future for the darkness comic movies "
3132," Interestingly depressing. Intereseting colors, setting... But can't say I was amazed. The story is plain and not much action.
"," Phoenix definitely does a great job portraying this joker and he is a good actor. However, the movie itself is more of a drama, not an action movie or whatever. Second part will probably be with proper action...<br/><br/>I am depressed and was hoping that I will see myself in Joker. Well, partly I did. This movie has an interesting vibe which is not in many movies. "
3133," One more that's it!
"," This movie was perfect the way it was made I was completely in the world of the joker. I hope if another is made they don't have joker fight Batman (It's been done to death) because this movie was the beginning of joker so the next needs to be the life of joker up until Batman steps in and ends the movie. Bam 2 movies and the watcher can imagine the outcome.
Also I am estatic that joker was made for adults.... finally! "
3134," It's so real it's uncomfortable but in a good way...
"," This film left me intrigued and fascinated by its sheer power and emotional tone. This is by far one of the best and darkest versions of hero movies taken to the next level. Gritty and real in a way other DCU or MCU stories have never been told or could be expected to do so. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. without a doubt; his portrayal of the character of Arthur a mentally ill down trodden man having the worst day ever which throws him over the edge, manages to touch the soul and fears of every member of the audience who will undoubtedly leave the theatre with an uncomfortable sense of unsettledness. "
3135," Joaquin Wins
", It's been a long time since a performance like this. With all the repetitive blockbusters and unoriginal remakes it's hard to be inspired but this performance literally made the hair on my arms stand up....Once again....Bravo Joaquin....Bravo! 
3136," Phoenix rises!
",
3137," One of the best movies of all time
"," Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal.
This movie is a masterpiece. "
3138," Good movie
"," Ne of the best movies I've ever seen.
Such a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix in his lifetime act. "
3139," Great Acting
", I am not sure why some people didn't like this movie and why some people objected that it promote violence. Maybe because some kids expected it to be similar to other batman movies but this movie is from grownups. It dosen't promote violence and it shows less destructions than many other Hollywood movies. It's just another Joker movie but it's also not. It shows the emotional side of the Joker. The cinetomagraphy and Joaquin acting alone is worth the money and time. 
3140," MOVIE OF THE YEAR
"," This movie is truly a masterpiece. The acting, cenimatography and story all are really very good and soundtracks are also amazing. "
3141," Not another Batman movie
"," I overheard someone saying, ""I hope this isn't another Batman movie"" when I was walking in the cinema.
It isn't. Far from it. It is an amazing portrayal of how life has failed a man, driven him down a spiralling descent into insanity, and made him what he is. We can all relate to him.
Joaquin Phoenix had a lot to live up to after Heath Ledger. But he has the the role his own, with an outstanding performance worthy of an Oscar. He is mad, he is bad, but you can't help but feel sympathy for him.
Not often I give a movie ten stars, but this is one of those occasions. Go and see it now! It's an amazing piece of cinema. "
3142," Joker is a masterpiece
"," Joker deals with the tragic reality of life, not like cgi movies like marvel. This is a movie everyone should watch. "
3143," I would give this 20 if I could
"," Sad. Poignant. Rivetting. Mesmerising. Even funny at times. And utterly, utterly terrifying. This film is a crescendo, a masterpiece of cinema. The soundtrack alone makes this Best Picture. If Joker isn't Best Picture, and Phoenix isn't Best Actor, then what little credibility The Acadamey still has will be in shreds for all the world to see.
Joker proves that some people in the industry still know how to make movies, and that some people truly understand their source material. The Joker was NEVER a joke, he was a terror. Phoenix portrays this to absolute perfection . I'll never look at HIM the same way again.
I left the cinema three hours ago and I'm still shaken.
Not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for snowflakes, but otherwise this is an absolute must see.
Bravo!! "
3144," Incredible üòç
", Joaquin Phoenix is the best joker. I highly recommend watching the movie 
3145," Masterpiece
"," This is an absolute masterclass in character acting from Joaquin Phoenix, not so much a superhero/villain story, it is more of a study of mental health issues in society today, drug addiction and the social issues facing people who society has left behind, you will struggle to find any actor who deserves the oscar this year "
3146," Best movie this year
", It was a great movie..I hope there is part 2 next year 
3147," Exceeded expectations and surprised me in the most gruesome way possible
"," I was predicting out of the blue after seeing the first look trailer that this has potential and can be one of the best movies ever made.
Well, i was not expecting to actually be right.
Visceral, symbolical, real, sometimes too real in the best way possible, and doing justice to the unbelievable and legendary villain that Joker is.
The character has had some amazing people portraying him. Another Oscar for the joker might be coming soon. "
3148," Joaquin Phoenix is badass
", Joaquin Phoenix is badass in this glorious movie. Definitely recommend you to watch Joker either in IMAX or (but this is quite rare to find) in 70mm. It is worth it. 
3149," Master piece ......!
", One of the best...... Classic.. Best in the 2019.. And all time best. MUST WIN OSCAR 
3150," Outstanding

3151," On a different level
"," The movie leaves you with an understanding of the joker and he's motivations.
I have a new favourite joker and I can only hope to see him again "
3152," Hell yeah
",
3153," The meaning of comedy.
"," Firstly, Joaquin Phoenix was successful in creating another iconic version of the Joker character. When Phoenix is in full clown make up and wardrobe, is hard to take one's eyes away from the screen. The vivid personification of the Joker superimposed on real, vintage NY street locations gives the film an extra layer of legitimacy. The greater issue with the film however is the pace and climactic buildup. In other words, the film is like a race horse tied up with a short rope. The meticulous clinical assessment of the Joker hampers the delivery of the story. He music score and soundtrack are no help. That being said, find a comfortable position in your chair and wait for the brilliance to reveal itself. "
3154," Before Watching: Joker (2019)
",
3155," One of the best ever!
"," What an amazing adaptation of a comic book character. Phoenix had the most amazing performance. That is saying so much given his past works of perfection. This movie has given us so much to think about and not just about the income inequality issue but so much, much more. I really hope he gets the nod... "
3156," This Origin story is no joke!
",
3157," A Masterpiece
",
3158," First time not just watching, but living a Movie
"," It was first time for me to not just watching, but feeling, living the film. With Joaquin incredible performance, this movie is way more worth to watch. "
3159," Absolutely amazing!
"," One of these movies when you finished watching and thought it's so sad, because you have a chance to rewatch it later after release of blu ray or smth, but you never feel the same absolutely amazing first impression about this movie again.
It feels like this movie about side character Joker is much more better than a movie with the main character batman! It beats all batman movies for me. Don't hesitate and go to cinema now! "
3160," 8.9? This movies deserves at least 9 or more ratings
"," Well I don't review often here but this movie just amazed me in the way I never expected.<br/><br/>The cinematography, acting, score were all top notch and I believe everyone should watch this movie. This is a masterpiece. "
3161," First movie made me returned to cinema for second round want to write a review
"," Joaquin is not performing or acting, this movie, the script and the lines seem to real that Joaquin is joker himself, especially after read some related articles about how this movie was made, to me if this movie enters Oscar is like Larry Bird goes into 3 point contest
10/10 recomand to all "
3162," Woah
"," Holy sweet baby Jesus. This movie. This movie right here was by far the best DC movie they have ever made. If no one can see the whole perspective of a man that literally has so many issues, and not feel sorry for him then you are clearly missing the point. This movie makes you see into the life of someone that is not mentally stable and if you have no emotion whether it's negative or positive by the time it ends then this movie is not for you. I left the theater numb. It makes you torn between wanting to feel sorry for the bad guy, glad he did what he did, and mad at yourself for feeling that way. I have never felt this way coming out of the movie theater in my life, and that's why movies like this are my favorite because it makes you think about people that have gone out and done crazy violent things and why they might have done what they did. I absolutely love this movie. I will watch this movie again, and again after. It is a real mind trip and Joaquin was amazing. I think he's the best joker thus far, In my eyes. Right up there with Heath ledger. I think no one else can play joker except him from now on. So all the new DC movies coming out take note, listen to your fans. Keep Joaquin as your joker please. No one else, only him. That's all I've got to say! "
3163," What side do you belong to?
"," Joker is a tremendously clever film.
When watching it you are torn as to whether you are on or off the Joker's side. A soul twisted by his upbringing and environment and yet a sickeningly twisted soul.
The whole dilemma is brilliantly crafted by using The Glitter Band for Joker's dance scene. I personally was torn between the controversy of using such song and yet loving how well it worked.
I think Todd Phillips is the true Joker in this. "
3164," masterpiece
", I remember watching one flew over the cuckoos nest.and was equally mesmerised by joaquin phoenix and Todd Phillips' masterclass of cinema . 
3165," Second viewing - even better!!!
"," I went for a swcond viewing. After the first, I gave it 8/10. After second, I gave it a straight 10/10. This will become one of the best movies of all time for sure. The Dark Knight
finally gets its counterpart in ""Joker"". Brilliant movie, the Hype is real!!! "
3166," I just....I dunno what I'm saying just very very beautiful!
"," All I have to say is I very much enjoyed it this movie üëå, very cool it deserves too many awards "
3167," The ""Woke"" society has created a true masterpiece
"," After seeing many of the interviews from Todd Phillips that he refuses to direct comedies due to the way that the world has changed since the hangover, one of the best 00s comedies, was released. And for once Im thankful that the world has beaten a guy so badly that he had to change his style because he created a true masterpiece that will go down in history for the character and his directorial style.<br/><br/>This film is hauntingly epic through the complete destruction of 1 mans life to turning that pain into complete madness that ultimately ends in one of the greatest shots of a man who had finally found his calling. His blood smile creates another version of the infamous joker smile, from the furry upper lip of Cesar Romero, the acid burnt smile of Jack Nicholson, the scars of Heath Ledger and the golden grill of Jared Leto this has to be the most grounded and realistic version.<br/><br/>Theres so many parts of this movie that are epic, Joaquin Phoenix alone carries that tag from his Oscar winning performance, from sad to angry to regretful and back to pure harmony in the final scenes. But all of the kills that were made during this movie had already hurt him in someway before being killed. First the Wayne Enterprise employees gave him a kicking and they didnt expect him to fight back. His mum, withheld all the information of his abusive childhood and where he made have developed his unnerving laugh at the hands of her ex boyfriend. Randell for giving him the gun that started the decent into madness, in such a quick and brutal killing in front of a witness. Then finally Murray Franklin for remarking about his last on stage performance.<br/><br/>The true start of the joker is when he kills his mum its like the last piece of Aurther had also died at that moment. With the tag line of the movie being echoed during this moment cements this as one of the underrated parts of the movie. With honestly the dance of control after the first killing is by far the best part of the movie. Trying to center himself after the first loss of control was haunting. After hearing this was improvised during filming of just Phoenix and Phillips in the room adds fewer weight to this.<br/><br/>The main question that is hanging over this film is that it'll always be compared to Ledgers Joker and its an insult to both versions to be compared to each other! Ledgers is a perfect Batman joker that has been crazy and fighting for years before hitting the big time. Where Phoenixs Joker is the true origin story that was promised and could well lead to the best Batman Joker but sadly this will never happen. Both are perfect in their own stories, if they switched neither would work.<br/><br/>Best Movie of 2019 "
3168," Unbelievably Good
"," Joaquin Phoenix delivers an outstanding performance. Similarly to Scorseses The Taxi Driver, Joker is dark and gritty reflection of today's society. A must watch movie!!! "

The movie is not made for everyone, you need to have the guts to stand the heavy and agonizing atmosphere with various moments of excitement from beginning to end. Joaquin Phoenix could be said to have had an Oscar performance, and DC / Warner and screenwriters Todd Phillips and Scott Silver are to be congratulated for this work. For those who'll watch expecting a superhero movie or ""Marvel comedy,"" don't even bother to go to the movies. "

There are genuine moments of absolute genius here, and some images and scenes that I imagine will go down in cinema history as Iconic and legendary.<br/><br/>This movie deserves to be in the top 20 films of all time, easily. And as far as I am personally concerned, it now comfortably sits in my top 5 favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>Just go watch it.

3183," Good but overhyped!!
"," Just seen it! Interesting film to watch, but i have seen better similar movies.<br/><br/>In this movie, Joker is more a fool and pathetic, than genius and sadistic sarcastic crazy man. You wonder how such lozer and fool can become a brilliant criminal mind. You feel sorry for this man, instead of being frightened and admiring him.<br/><br/>The acting is good but not that great as everyone is saying. I don't get the hype.
Maybe because everyone desires so much a great DC movie, they're praising it to the sky. I know for sure, after 5 or 10 years everyone will say: ""it was not that great"".
Everyone are just echoing what other people are saying. "
3184," It's hard to find a negative to this piece of perfection.
"," From the moment this movie started I got sucked into the story. A story of a broken man's journey to insanity. Makes me feel like this could happen to anyone. Joaquin Phoenix is now one of the actors I respect the most. Being able to deliver a performance that stacks up to Legder's is remarkable. Not that one is better than another, they're just different. And the laugh is dead on. I literally almost started crying feeling sorry for Joaquin as he laughed in agony. The cinematography is pure art, without using CG. One of the most dramatic scenes is him walking down a hallway. That's impressive.
The violence feels so real, and does not sympathize with it, as critics might suggest.
I mean, could it have been any better? 10. "
3185," Superb Mr P
", Great piece of acting by Joaquin. This deserves an Oscar 
3186," Someone please check on Joaquin Phoenix!
"," Such a riveting and lifelike portrayal of someone's descent into insanity, I worry that he may have to get professional help himself. So many touchpoints with De Nero in Taxi Driver that I need to watch that again. Distilled brilliance... "
3187," This is how Joker is supposed to be
", Joaquin Phoenix did justice to the role. I wouldn't compare it with Heath Ledger's Joker. Both of them are equally amazing. But this movie is much more darker. The movie portrays how society created the dark nemesis of Batman. It is darker than most DC movies. Nolan portrayed it as an evil but intelligent schemer. But this movie portrays how a schizophrenic and depressed person who wanted people to accept him was pushed to a limit even by his mother decided to put an end to it. Phoenix has made a lot of sacrifice and justice to the roles. One thing that I found in the movie that didn't fit is killing of Bruce's parents. But it has a poetic justice I suppose. Society created Joker and Joker setting motion to events that made him by means of a movement created by him create Gotham's dark Knight. And man oh man Robert De Niro was a treat to watch.

3199," Best movie off the decade
"," I was getting sick off going to the cinema these days with crappy sequels, soulless action flick and just the same old films that keeps ruining Hollywood, but then I watched Joker and I have to say that the if people keeps making movies like this I have no doubt that the film industry is saved. This is an absolute masterpiece that just sucks you ind and never lets go. Its brutal, its terrifying, its so tragic that you really feel for Arthur Flex and his alter ego the Joker to the point that you almost forgets that he actually is a psychopathic killer. Jacqueline Phoenix gives the performance of his life, the laughter, the smile and his creepy and sympathetic voice sells the character completely 100 pro cent. I love this movie, is the best movie I have seen in a decade, and I don't think that will change any time soon. "
3200," Nice character development but far from Heath Ledger's Joker
"," The cinematography and acting is top notch. Still something is missing from this Joker. The criminal mastermind from comics isn't present at all in this version, which makes it quite pathetic as a villain. The quotes from Nolan's Joker ""Why so serious"" or ""Let's put a smile on that face"" are still fresh so from my point of view an 8/10 is justified. "
3201," Joaquin manages to perfectly embody the essence of Joker
"," It managed to keep me guessing, even though i had seen all the trailers and tv spots. Joaquin Phoenix acting was almost on par with Heath Ledger's. Even though there's not enough screen time of the Joker, Arthur's struggles and everyday punches life threw at him and the perspective through which Todd managed to capture all of these events are very interesting and Oscar worthy. Don't let us down Oscars 2020. "
3202," Impressive performance, good movie but not a masterpiece
"," I'm analyzing this movie in a most neutral way possible. To me it sits between a 7 and an 8. There a few things that hold its high rating back . For instance he becomes the agent of chaos of the city only as a side effects of his acts when you think about it. Killing first by self defense and then again because he's pissed at being made fun of. For a Joker in the making , that's poor IMO. There absolutely zero context / introduction to the suit which surprised me . In fact , the script got a scene where he put that suit to go to his mother's funeral before going to the TV show which is a great introduction and gives it a deeper meaning for the movie and joker character in general. I mean , what would be batman begins without the origin of the suit in it... see my point ? No idea why they cut this great idea out of the movie. And finally you never feel even at the end when the city riot , even though the shot with the blood on his face is very nice , that there is that moment where he finally snap for good, that juicy Joker moment you dream of seeing the nervous laughs becoming the dark intentional laugh. The climax is short and a bit underwhelming as he just dance again awkardly for the ..... 4th time... ? Phoenix was very good but people seems to mix good performance and good movie for their rating. A good movie is the sums of its parts which again is why I think Phoenix bring it up a notch to touch the 8 out 10... but otherwise perfect masterpiece 10 movie? Not at all. "

3207," Narrative issues...not a masterpiece!! but a master performance from Phoenix
"," Effective imagining of the forces that shape a malcontent, but its been done to death, the abused disenfranchised being who is forced through pain into psychotic breakout, lashing out against injustice, his tormentors and society. This was such a cliche rationale for the advent of Joker in the world of Gotham, it was at its heart way too mainstream in narrative, going into details of child abuse ?? Like a Daily Mail headline, a really really bad idea and a very ordinary device. And did I really hear CREAM ? Omg could not believe my ears coz of the White Room madhouse scene looming ??? AAGH ..that was a very poor choice and ripped me out of Gotham city post haste and into London's Troubadour club. This film could have been way more imaginatively written and executed, and seriously if not for JP it might have fallen very flat indeed. Yes he contortioned himself in extra ordinary ways to bring Arthur to life and he deserves the Oscar. But lets not forget he is NOT the Joker as was Heath, he is Arthur pre-Joker.... so can people please stop comparing. AND it is NOT a masterpiece, so can people think before they declare it thus...its a film with an absolute tour deforce performance that elevates it above the mediocre, that's what it is. And may i add that this individual Arthur and his characterization as presented here could NOT become clever wily Joker, he s a sad loser who s been brutalized and is now kill crazy. Not too bright. Not ever gonna actually be DC JOKER, so there s a disconnect and one so fundamental that it kind of makes this film redundant as part of the Batman Gotham diaspora....so in summary its an arresting characterization of a mentally ill person sure, but i felt no connection at all between Arthur and Joker, i think they forgot about context and cohesion and veered off into some place between Falling Down and Cuckoos Nest "
3208," So powerful
", You won't understand the complexity of this story unless you suffered or cooping with a mental illness 
3209," Ignore the mixed reviews, Joker is a Masterpiece and could be one of the best movies of the decade
"," At first I was hesitant to watch this film, mainly because of DC's past movies like Suicide Squad, Batman V Superman, Justice League, etc. But this is a more realistic take on one of the most iconic super villains of all time. Joker is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is spectacular and I never thought I would see another movie that looked as stunning as this. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in my opinion is better than Heath Ledgers. The movie is presented in a dream-like manor, moments where scenes are just fantasies in Arthur's head which makes it ambiguous and up for interpretation. The final 15 minutes is absolutely phenomenal and I left the movie theater with a smile, highly satisfied with what I saw. Film buffs would appreciate this movie more due to it's themes and Martin Scorsese-like-style. If you love Martin Scorseses movies like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, then you will love this film. Don't listen to the mixed reviews, if you want to have a great 2 hrs and 2 mins, then go see this movie. "

This movie will remain in my library of movies I repeatedly watch and never retire. Love how the director pulls in the audience with Fleck's sad and depressing life. You almost begin to feel sorry for him, another disadvantaged soul failed by the system. Love how the transition plays out and you slowly see Fleck becoming more aware and comfortable with his true nature, dark. I gasped in a few times due to unpredictable scenes and I love the director for that! This movie is Oscar worthy and thank you for casting Joaquin to play this role!

Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance that's extremely committed and undoubtedly one of his best and also definitely worthy of an oscar. All the supporting performances are brief but effective, with Robert De Niro giving the best supporting performance. It's extremely well paced and beautifully filmed. The direction by Todd Philips is excellent and proves he can do much more than just comedies. The musical score is incredible as well the soundtrack which works perfectly. "
3219," Joker
"," To begin with, when we hear the name of Joker, we imagine that it is a superheroic blockbuster where should be a lot of action moments. This film brokes the rules, it is a complete drama, and it is not for DC viewers because they mainly demand movies that will be very lite and will not strain them. Therefore it would be better if the producers gave this film another topic. In that case, it will inspire people a bit more. "

3222," Why are you even checking? Go see this movie!
", Joaquin Phoenix was excellent. Dude has some dance moves. My wife said it was the first 'superhero' movie she liked. The mood and the soundtrack were on point. I was blown away by how much I liked this film. 
3223," Nailed it.
", Low intelligence people will find themselves triggered by this movie. Pure genius! A cinematic marvel that may come off too real in these times of an immoral dictator empowering the mentally ill to act violently. 
3224," Oscar ready!
", Just got back from watching joker. All I can say is mind blown. Is it a great film? No. The first third drags. It lumbers along at a snail's pace. But. You can never take your eye off the screen. Jokers character is a slow burn that continues to build. Its captivating. Dont expect a DC film. Dont wish for an extended universe entry or a reboot. This is stand alone. If you can except that then strap in and enjoy the ride. This isn't the joker you know. It's the greatest solo performance ever. Dark. Twisted. Aggressive but equally compassionate. When this film reaches its stride its unstoppable. I left disappointed in the overall movie but elated by one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. As a hugh batman fan I felt the Wayne's were unnecessary. They actually detracted from the films impact. Phoinex nails it. His loss of weight is disturbing as it should be to fit the characters intensity. His level of commitment shines. He lives and breathes his role. Its truly admirable and deserves to be considered one of the all time greatest performances in modern cinema. I would rate the film 6 but his performance forces me to rate a 10. Outstanding. 
3225," He has beaten Heath Ledger, whom I thought could never be replaced
"," He has beaten Heath ledger. Wow, he deserves an Oscar. The story and his acting is so gripping that I will watch it again. The movie is very well crafted. The only drawback was that it showed Bruce Wayne to be too young. That means when he grows up, the Joker will attain old age. "

"," For me Joker is the best movie in 2019. The stroryline is too deep. I really feel the misery experienced by Joker. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is almost perfect. That laugh, smile, and his cruelty is really look like Heath Ledger Joker version, which is the best Joker actor for me. One more thing, this movie scoring is great and the last i like how they are taking picture. The cinematography is great. Joker really deserves an oscar. No debate. "
3229," The best joker story ever
", I have to confess that I never enjoyed like this movie in whole of my life.... 
3230," Expected A LOT and still got completely AMAZED!
"," Joaquin Phoenix delivered a stunning acting performance, and the movie in general is an absolute UNIT of a movie with the Joker being emotionally and physically perfect for the movie. The way Joaquin was able to laugh and smile so incredibly much and still be able to show the misery and sadness in his face and eyes was stunning! 10/10 would recommend to everyone! "
3231," Powerful psychodrama led by an incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix!
"," Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of a lifetime as Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society. It's more of a psychological character study than a comic book film. Todd Phillips did a great job directing, as did the cinematographers, turning New York City into an almost hellish landscape.<br/><br/>Joker is a dark psychodrama of nihilism and Joaquin Phoenix's disturbing performance as the iconic Clown Prince is the embodiment of pure anarchy. But never once did this movie feel like it was glorifying radical anarchism or anything like that. It's more of a cautionary tale, and critique of societal failings, shedding awareness to all the things that are misunderstood about the misunderstood.<br/><br/>9/10. "
3232," Amazing!
"," The first movie in a long time that has taken the time to actually build a character, truly captivating! Absolutely worth the watch! "
3233," An unexpected and mezmorizing journey.
",
3234," Amazing film!
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance. He truly brings this character to life in a sympathetic, yet sinister way. The character build up was on point and the ambience of this was felt deeply. The music a created a serene and melancholic atmosphere that was hard to ignore. "
3235," It's not a movie for everyone
"," It's not a movie for everyone. It's very much focussed on the mental aspect of the Joker. It shows how it feels to live with a mental illness, how the world and system impact it, but most importantly it shows how Arthur perceives, struggles and finally breaks because of this. "
3236," Best villain movie ever made with the best actor to play the joker.
"," The movie had helped me a lot to know about the joker, and what really happened since he was a chilled. And Joaquin Phoenix in my opinion should get an Oscar award for his best ever performance. I hope to see Phoenix play more with this incredible character, and maybe in the next Batman movies too.<br/><br/>Thanks Comics followers, "
3237," Exceeded my expectations and then some!
"," I truly was impressed by this film. The performance of not just Joaquin Phoenix, but the entire ensemble is something to be revered. Todd Phillips did a magnificent job directing and you could see the care that was put into crafting every shot of this film. Few films these days are as thought provoking as this one and I spent a good hour outside the cinema discussing it with my friends.<br/><br/>I disagree that this film glorifies violence. The way it depicts violence is incredibly harrowing and I actually found myself feeling a wee bit ill at the result of some of Arthur's actions. If anything, it highlights the importance of mental health care and the potential implications of someone like Arthur being ignored and abused by the system. "
3238," Best movie of 2019
"," From the minute Joaquin Pheonix comes on the screen as Arthur Fleck, you know he's going to steal the show in the movie. From it's goose-pricking music to the gritty violence to the incredible acting and dialogues, Joker is a masterpiece and true perfection from minute one to the last minute. Pheonix's potrayal as Arthur Fleck is flawless and makes you root for him no matter what insane and unpredictable act of madness he's commited. Can't believe the person who gave us Hangover 3 gave us this movie... "
3239," The making of the ""Dark Knight Joker""
"," A normal guy turning into the Joker you have seen in Dark Knight. Everything about the character in Dark knight starts making more sense when you see this Joker. Heath Ledger would have been so proud of Phoenix. Phoenix has done a phenomenal justice to this role and have added so much meaning to the ""Joker"" character. The second half has a build up with great background music!! The empathy developed for such a negative role may surprise you. But this may be because you saw the picture from Joker's shoe this time! "
3240," Disturbing, yet worth watching
"," I don't understand why this movie is getting so much negativity, Todd Philips just trying to tell a story which he quoted as 'Woke culture' in one way or other the message is very clear it's reflection of our society which we live in, the mental illness is serious problem and should be treated accordingly and given extra care. Can't believe we live in a era where a comic book movie has so much impact on people. Overall it's Wonderful movie and Phoenix deserve an Oscar for his portrayal of Joker. "

3245," new JOKER
"," Todd Philips created Joker in form we didn't know. Joker is based on today's vile times, it is set before batman came. I must applause very hard to how much Joker made me think about everything around me, how system is corrupted and how Joker became targer of laughs at Gotham. They made me think of him as just ordinary failing comediant, sick person who needs help, it made me discover his true nature and made me watch his sick and beautifuly crafted transformation from Arthur Fleck to Joker
After movie, you realize sick people like Arthur Fleck needs help and they don't deserve be ignored<br/><br/>MASTERPIECE - thats movie we wanted to see!<br/><br/>Devastating, emotional, depresive, nervous movie, perfect soundtrack. Every move he makes is pure art of acting, he makes you live through his eyes, im very satisfied with acting in this movie. This deserves Oscar for best picture and... remember ...that's LIFE ü§°<br/><br/>10/10 "
3246," Timeless Masterpiece
"," This movie is a timeless masterpiece and will be remembered for generations. Go watch this movie in theatres to be part of the history and make it great. It gives full justice to the character of joker, even exceeds the expectations of what a joker fans like me want to see. One can't imagine someone as joker after Heath Ledger but Joaquin Phoenix nailed it. Just Great!! "
3247," Visually stunning! Well research character portrayal
"," Usually, I leave the cinema with a reason to judge harshly...to find that single iota of imperfection, and then lambast it; and yet, this film has left me speechless.
A film who's exploration was not only the to horrify you with their antagonist/protagonist but also leaves you emphasizing with him, questioning whether the actions, attitudes and beliefs and modern society can potentially give rise to this chaos.
Mental health, as clearly addressed here, needs much more funding. "

"," So far this is My best movie i've seen this year ... no doubt
Joaquin and Heath Ledger on the same level "

3250," Best movie and best actor of 2019
"," The whole crew, director, actors and an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix, all contribute to a work of Art. An origin story from a different and modern point of view, this masterpiece is certain to fascinate every viewer, from comic enthusiasts to the most demanding and sophisticated movie critics. The creation of our favourite comic book sociopath, which is depicted in this film, can easily qualify as a surrealistic look and evaluation of a modern, faceless society sinking into madness. "
3251," Under 18 year- Don't bother yourself to watch this movie.
"," Joker who tries to spread happiness and joy to everyone, faced the harsh cruelties of life and lack of empathy from everyone. This movie basically shows the 1980s' America, when CCTV Cameras were not there and the grotesque and hideous act took place every now and then. He, who has mental disorder and uncontrollable-hysterical laughter, when pushed on the brink, comes out to be a sociopath and sadist. This movie basically show the harsh reality of today's world, where everyone is looking for their own benefit. No one is ready to see others' condition or show empathy. The plot of the movie is intriguing, strong and practical. Camera angles are totally perfect -like they even show the hand and legs movements of The Joker, whenever he feel excruciating, the ending of the movie is wonderfully captured- I mean the ending of the movie will make an impact on you even after the movie. Eventually, every single second of this movie is totally wortg watching. Don't want to spoil anything because this is the irresistible content. "
3252," A VERY Comprehensive Review
", This movie is BLOODY AWESOME. Watch it ASAP if you haven't already. It's my favorite DC movie second only to V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>P.S. Phoenix is getting an Oscar for this. 
3253," Brilliance
"," This movie is as good as dark knight for me. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't bag the Oscars, then I shall reach to the conclusion that academy doesn't care about talent. This was an emotional ride. You can understand why joker is, what he is. And where Ledger's Joker was a trickster cum terrorist type, this one is pure evil, dark and heavily mentally disturbed. I won't say he surpasses Ledger, but I also won't say that Ledger dominates, best is to say that both are equally fantastic. This has a very different tone. It solely relies on Phoenix's performance, without phoenix there won't be the magic in the movie. Also another thing was the story is fully focused on Joker, nothing else. This is more of a character study movie. Also the story and the way it's shot looks very much like a comic book. Overall, god bless Todd Philips and DC and Warner Bros and of course Phoenix for this "
3254," Just give pheonix an OSCAR
"," This movie was wonderful on many levels , it show the takeover of society by the elites , it shows the inner depths of the psyche of a psychopath,it shows how life can be viewed as super complex or as the most useless overrated thing ever . Its has million good things going for it , but the thing thats shines above all is the acting by pheonix . The acting is so realistic u forget u are watching a movie , definitely one of the best acting i have ever seen in a movie . Go watch it if u can , u wont regret it . "
3255," The ticket sales should tell you everything
"," The joker is an iconic take on the baddie of DC Comics. The acting will leave you speeches and while I wanted to give a 10 star rating, I realized there are better movies. The ticket sales itself have blown the roof. Good luck with getting a ticket! By the end, unlike the MCU movies, you really think more about the real world since it connects so well with our world. You begin to sympathize the man who was rejected, turned down,mocked, betrayed and still held his ground even though his own mental condition would not permit until one day he finally snaps. It is like water hitting on your rock solid defense and eroding it away slowly until one fateful day when it becomes too much to bear. We've all been there, witnessed our guard fall down, held on to whatever we held dear but watched it trickle down like sand from within the fingers. You realize that deep down, all it takes is one bad day to turn the sanest man insane. Villains aren't born, they are created.
When you connect the Heath Ledger version with the Joaquin Phoenix version, it all starts to make sense. While Warner Bros has stated the movie is a standalone, it can be regarded as a prequel to the Dark Knight joker. But if you like it as a standalone, good luck with that! "
3256," Top Notch
"," Right from the start, this movie has you hooked to your seats and tells a very disturbing tale about a man who is a bullied and disregarded by the society and what makes him turn into a maniac. You feel pain in Arthur's laughter and empathize him.<br/><br/>Sheer brilliance, Phoenix has aced the manic cackle and he does deserve an oscar for this . He is as good as Ledger if not better than him.<br/><br/>Note : To me he was better than ledger in a few scenes in the movie "
3257," Oscar for best movie and best actor
"," It's a fantastic movie, I wish it would have released before batman so that when the joker and batman faces each other it would have been a epic scene. Every aspect of the movie seemed perfect. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. The scene where Robert De Niro and joker has conversation at live show was historical. An Epic movieüëèüëè "
3258," A Modern Crime Thriller.
"," Joker shows the harsh realities of the society we live in.
It emphasis on morality and how people make it worse for themselves and others around them.
Just like The Dark Knight, Joker doesn't have a traditional Protagonist and Antagonist. A person can be a Hero for some and a Monster for other. This may get Todd Philips best Screenplay and Director oscar nominations
Now talking about acting Joaquin Phoenix's performance is awe inspiring he is always been a great actor and he shows it here too people like to compare different iterations of joker but they are all different takes on the characters Joaquin Phoenix brings humanity into this version of the character. Being so impressive he may land up an oscar nomination and even a possible win.
Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's score submerges you into the movie's thrillers, horrors and its character's psychology.
To conclude its not some random superhero/villian stuff its a cinematic masterpiece of character study. "
3259," Heart wrenching yet beautiful performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
", The perfect tribute to the origin of the clown prince of crime.Never thought anyone would be able to fill up the shoes left by Ledgers Joker but was mistakenly.A masterpiece and must watch as it opens ones eyes to how a capitalist society with little empathy creates a the embodiment of anarchy. 
3260," WOW, Movies have really gone down as just Evil
"," Today's Hollywood simply wants to make Nutjobs look like they can become anti-heroes.
I simply hated it, as another DC crappy movie of Darkness that just falls in line with the TV show Gothem, which is awful as well.
So far, the only DC Movies that I have thoroughly enjoyed is Wonder Woman, and I've enjoyed the Recent Batman Movies.
Superman sucked and so does this Gothem crap! "
3261," Dull and dark. An unnecessary cash cow
"," Acting and cinematography are outstanding. Joaquin is incredible throughout. That's as far as the compliments go.<br/><br/>The plot lacks any creativity, it's unnecessarily dark and smacks of a sequel within 15 minutes of being seated in the theatre. I get there has to be some character development but at least leave the feeling of getting rinsed for cash until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Whilst I appreciate the inevitability of the Joker's story being told, I feel the consistently dark nature of the film left me bereft of any positivity. Nolan achieved the balance; this movie did not. This was highlighted when the audience laughed at the vertically challenged man being unable to escape the apartment after a particularly brutal murder. It's a sad indictment that we've become so desensitised that this is deemed comedy.<br/><br/>There is no humour to be found here. Nor any light. It's watchable to see the Phoenix tour de force but don't expect to feel like it's money well spent. The narrative is wooly and many good songs are now ruined by being in this soundtrack. Avoid. "
3262," Absolut brilliant!
"," My first reaction to the trailer wasnt so good, i kinda compared The dark knight joker with this one. So i wasnt so hyped for the movie cuz i felt like the trailer didnt give me that psychopath joker that goes on a killingspree. But after i watched the movie it all turned 180¬∞. This movie is a masterpiece and you can see that for yourself just by looking at the rating. No movie in the history of IMDB has been at 9.6/10 for this long. No more words to say but i just cant explain the greatness of this movie. Just give it a shot and go to the theaters its definitely worth the money. Hope you enjoy it like i did! (Sure you willüòÉ) "
3263," Overrated overhyped movie

"," The only good thing about this movie is Joaqin did very well indeed bringing the best of Joker, other than that it is just watching a Documentary, but the boring one. "
3267," Great cast and picture quality, needs storyline.
"," I respect everyone's opinion in regards to the movie, I just wished the production focused a lot more on the actual storyline and proper adaptation to the Joker character we've know since we were young. It's a 10 out of 10 for the acting and picture quality, not arguing that a single bit. However, the storyline itself is just not all there per se. The performance from the cast was absolutely marvelous, I just hope the production comes out with a second movie to correct the mistakes on this one. "
3268," Overly forced perception of the performing ""arts""
"," Worst movie I've ever seen in my life, the only good part was when Joker shot RobertDinero in the face.
Unless you really really overboard into performing arts (not including acting, because they all sucked)

3269," Tedious and self indulgent
"," Excited by the many glowing reviews I sat down in my local Odeon with anticipation to watch Joker. Unfortunately it fairly quickly became clear that the Joke was on me. I feel like the little boy in the tale of the Emperor's New Clothes, the only one able to tell the truth about what I saw. Nothing but a gloomy, depressing character study with Phoenix trying and failing to hang on to the ciat tails of the incomparable Heath Ledger. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. If you don't it will be two hours of your life wasted that you'll never get back. "
3270," Wow!!üòç

3271," Choker - Why so serious? Master piece of crepe
"," You'd think from the trailers you're getting a masterpiece, but it's really just 2 hours of closeups of Joaquim Phoenix face making pained expressions. By the end of the movie, you'll wish you had gone to see It Pt 2 instead, because least that clown was interesting. Too serious for its own good.
This movie is going to be a Choker, it's not going to do well. Todd Philips should stick to Hangover movies. "
3272," Bring your phone and ear-buds

3273," Why so tedious
"," I think this is the worst film I've ever seen in the cinema. So tedious and boring. Says nothing of any worth about any of the subjects it raises and the lionisation of Joker is ridiculous. He is a joke, not a hero. His mental illness and treatment by others is something we should empathise with and yet he's a loser, he is an A hole who we are meant to feel sorry for?? he's not scary and he kills with no consequences. The people that then support him and cheer him on - he's doesn't even engage with them. He says nothing to them, not a word. There is no message and if I hear that laugh again I might, well, let's not go there. This film is so disappointing and just awful. I hate it more than anything I've seen in the cinema in 40 years. "
3274," WTF!
"," I am not a DC comic aficionado nor do I know the Joker character that well. I do know enough to realize that the JOKER movie was a Hollywood, in your face political statement, but that's just me.
The movie was disappointing. I appreciated Joaquin's acting but there was little enjoyment in sitting through this film. I wanted to see the SUPER VILLAIN JOKER, the guy who kills for no reason. I kept waiting for it. I found myself saying, ""okay, here it is, this is the moment the movie goes to that dark, gory place."" It never got there and at the end I was like WTF!
I think I need to watch Dark Knight today in order to get this abomination of the DC Joker character out of my mind. "
3275," A sad letdown of EPIC proportions
"," Seriously...After a very long time, got my expectations whacked and buried into the ground.
No memorable lines, no music, no story, no motive, no messages....Nothing- Just Joaquin Phoenix trying too hard to carry a movie that's seriously worth nothing without his acting.<br/><br/>And it's so long and boring that you can seriously notice your fingernails grow. "
3276," Disgusting links towards mental illness
"," This film proves how American TV, News and Films run off. I get the film and how some people like it but we can't ignore the fact it glorifies a Killer by using his mental illness as a sympathy cast for the viewers. The film has us trying to sympathize with mental illness patient who's sessions and medications is taken away and how society act towards him brutally, by him killing his oppressers and starting a riot. NO this is how America idolise school shooters by making them famous so that inspires other's to copy that and when Arthis realizes this he kills a TV Presenter live and is glorified as untouchable when the police car crash. This film makes it okay for people to think it's okay to kill and ruin lives so if some people are weak mentally than they will repeat an act of killing to be glorified and sympathized with this character. THIS FILM NEEDS TO BE PULLED BEFORE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO INNOCENT PEOPLE! "
3277," Good, but not as good as I wanted it to be
",
3278," Wonder how it's a good movie??
"," I wonder about the people who says""it's a good movie""?? (Not about performance). I guess some kind of advertising agency may played role to make this movie hit and few people who thinks themselves they are more intellectual (really may not) follow it. I never seen such a bad movie having no entertainment, no moral.. Moreover, I feel it's conveying dangerous message (cruel,kindless as hero) which may misleading immatured people(should be 18+) "
3279," On the nose directing and cinematography, empty storyline, nonsensical character development
"," From the ""music"" to the endless closeups of Joaquin Phoenix's contorting face and body, the Director makes all of his choices as if trying to make sure you know that this guy is weird, and potentially dangerous. I mean he could have personally come out saying what he wanted to say and this movie would have been subtler.<br/><br/>And the whole ""Thomas Wayne is your dad"" twist... probably the cheapest shot I've ever seen in any movie. Showing young Bruce in the fence, making Alfred be somewhat of a bad guy, and for sake showing the alley shooting AGAIN. Just cheap shot after cheap shot.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is right in your face, no subtlety, no implied meaning, no meaning at all. Strip out the Joker and DC connection, loose the on the nose choices, and this might have been a great movie about the seriousness of mental illness. Instead, it's not. It's boring, cheap, and an attempt to meaning that falls flat. "
3280," Why do we need movies like this in the world?
"," I reluctantly went to see this movie as my son had seen it and wanted to discuss with me after I had seen it myself. This movie is the darkest movie I have ever witnessed in my life since going to movies starting in the 60's, which have included Taxi Driver, Silence of the Lambs etc . Not withstanding, Phoenix delivered an incredible performance, but the whole pretext of Hollywood producing such a piece...well it just sickens me. Why has our culture has stooped to this level? There is even a scene that appeared to celebrate and represented the glorification of the devil himself. Sickening. "
3281," It's for reviewers not for masses classes either
"," With some real good facial muscle exercises and some new condition display ...when disappointed starts un controllable laughs ... The screenplay, story illogical gun firing murders leave us clueless ! We have seen heroics of Joker in Batman and By Raj in an Indi Cinema but here one fails to laugh. Neither enjoyable as Joker's personal tragedy is going crime provoked path. Difficult to digest senseless out come of incidences. It measurably becomes a pot boiler. It's a fashion to rate this movie high just to give more complexity. "
3282," Extremely good movie ruined by Batman having to battle a geriatric Joker.
",
3283," Perhaps it takes a special type of person to like this movie.
"," If you are looking for action, adventure I would not watch this movie..
It is nothing like any of the other DC series.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a psychological thriller. I would not watch this movie either.
There are no twists and bounds, here you know he will eventually become the ""Joker""<br/><br/>Many of the small things that happen in this movie have nothing to do with his character development.
It's simply not there.<br/><br/>Things that do, also make no sense at all. Like if his mom is crazy, why is he crazy he was adopted...<br/><br/>In the end does he doesn't even become the joker just some guy that accidentally killed 3 people then didn't feel about it.
There was NO wittyness about anything he did. It was either accidental or blunt, like he didn't care.<br/><br/>His jokes weren't even mildly trying to be funny he just laughed all the time apparently according to a ""medical condition""<br/><br/>Over all super disappointing. "
3284," A real joke
"," I really don't get all the hype about this movie. Depressing, disturbing, boring, no plot, no messages..all you get from this movie is the anger for the two wasted hours of your life.
Half the movie is about Phoenix loughing and dancing hysterically.
Without competition by far the worst movie I have ever seen. "

Waste of good time.the one star is for the title THE END. "
3292," Mediocre high budget movie.
"," This is one of those movies that uses top of the line production and a sky-high budget to mask an average-at-best storyline. Now before I say any more, Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job here and absolutely destroyed the role of the joker. But that is where the problems began -- the role of the joker. Most people know that this movie is the prelude to the modern joker (Suicide Squad, Dark Knight, etc..) but the delivery of the storyline starts to drag out about halfway through the movie. The movie is a true slow burn that sort of glosses over a major storyline of Thomas Wayne; the joker and batman are seemingly half-brothers now. This was a half-baked attempt to leave the franchise wide open. All in all, the Joker's disturbing personality and the mental health implications make this movie worth seeing. But with all the hype surrounding the movie, I was mildly dissapointed. "
3293," Nice performance by Joaquin Phoenix, but nut quite on the level of Heath Ledger
"," THe movie is good, but not as good as some of the reviews here could make you think. There are some boring parts, long sequences that should have been cut shorter.
Joaquin is good, great even, but Heath Legdge's Joker is leagues better.
The ending is very predictable, and the movie begin to be entertaining after the middle.
Don't go in with high expectations like me, you'd be disappointed. "
3294," Why is society accepting/encouraging this mindset?
"," I really don't understand why does the people like Joker's character so much. ""World is always unfair get use to it."" It does not make sense at all that a person should response to the society this way. I don't know which direction people are going and what will they achieve by following, enjoying, encouraging, appreciating this kind of character. "
3295," One Bright Spot - Joaquin Phoenix, That's Where It Ends
"," First off, Joaquin Phoenix reminded us why he's such a skilled immersive actor. He appears to do crazy quite well. But that's where it ended for me. Yes I've heard tons of people say that Joker is a masterpiece, brilliant, magnificent, blah...blah...blah. But in my opinion, it was a vicious mocking parable about mental illness. It directly connected mental illness and violence. If a person is mentally ill, then the likelihood that they'll eventually turn into a full-blown murderous psychopath is almost a 100% according to this film. Joker does nothing but further stigmatize mental illness, and it is a tired, worn-out destructive trope that Hollywood simply can't seem to move away from.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck (the Joker) is a broken, emotionally spent man, who has been dealt a series of bad hands in life. He's poor, lives in a depressed neighborhood, has a failed career as a clown, a sick mother (who we later learn has lied to him all of his life), been bullied unmercifully and is looking for some sort of human connection as he walks around Gotham (New York City in the 70s/early 80's). But this is a story that a lot of people can tell, but by no means does that say they're pushed to murder. Most folks take their meds, get therapy and work their way out of their unfortunate circumstances. Joker is also a story that has been told in films multiple times, and this film steals heavily from The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver and surprise, Robert De Niro is in the Joker.<br/><br/>Then you have the other go-to Hollywood tropes....the single Black mother played by Zazie Beetz (Fleck's fantasy love interest, don't get me started with this), the angry Black woman, the distant unfeeling, uncaring Black woman, and by the way, none of these women were used as plot devices, they were simply convenient props. Oh, and lets throw in a little class warfare and wealth disparity to put the period at the end of the sentence of tropes.<br/><br/>Anyone thinking that this is another incarnation of the comic book Joker characters we've seen before, will either be greatly disappointed or resoundingly relieved. There's no suited and booted superhero, no cool gadgets, no bat cave, no bat mobile or bat signal. This film is a dark, unsettling, meandering look at Fleck's descent into self-destruction and homicide, with the backdrop of old school New York City's grime, despair, poverty and filth. Joker is a stand-alone, brutal psychological thriller that simply wears out its welcome very quickly. But it'll make a ton of money, and no matter how mocking this film is of mental illness and Black women, money is really all that matters in Hollywood. "
3296," A trainwreck
"," Great, we go to a movie and pay money to see the underbelly of society. If you really want to see it, then enter the reality in your city and help someone like Fleck be a better person. Otherwise watch this movie so you won't have to wash your hands afterwards. "

Doesn't deserve to be on top 250 either. The best comic book movie of this year remains the masterpiece that was Avengers: Endgame. Watch that instead of this garbage.

3314," Hollow performance of real people
"," I took my girlfriend to see this film tonight. I felt a high watching it, but hollow empty, sad, and like something crucial was missing walking out. People be damned at the shattered image of an untouchable. Queen B Beyonce making a flat note is not allowed to be called flat in the same vein that Joaquin's performance is not allowed to be called pretentious, lacking in soul and heart for the most part, and primarily too self aware. Which it was. The performance sat on the surface and didnt sit still with the weight of feeling of someone marginalized being gaslighted by society.<br/><br/>Acting, and directing was pretentious, contrived, and on the nose. Many choices and decisions from the director's standpoint were never made that should have been made. Ex: Joker kills bully, small person is kinda afraid, but begins to leave, Joaquin builds tension as if he is about to hurt little person, and then let's him go saying he was ""the only one nice to him."" Made no sense for the Joker to stay close to the door and pretend like something bad might happen to him. As written and given the choices Joaquin made for the character, it made no sense that he would do this. The Joker's character choices were sloppy and inconsistent, and the characters intelligence vs naivete and awareness of others vs lack of awareness teeter tottered throughout the film making the Joker not a plausible fully realized character. Made zero sense.<br/><br/>The ability to show how innocence and purity in a cruel world can affect someone subtly removed looking for the beauty in it could have been an interesting story, but instead there was no consistency, sloppy directing. So much potential, but this film was such a blunder to me and did a disservice to those marginalized and on the peripheries; a much more discerning ethos of this world and misinformation and stigma surrounding mental illness and individuals that go against the grain could have been wonderfully explored. Instead, these messages flew over the writer's, actors' and director's' heads in everything that was personified.<br/><br/>Many 16-30 something non discerning white males will hail Joaquin for being ""genius/legend"" and fanboy without meat supporting their feelings. Most of the praise I'm sure for this demographic comes from the performative, violent, egocentric, self indulgent, incel induced sexism, and pretentious nature of Joaquin's portrayal and the needless violence and cruelness against women of Joaquin suffocating his mother callously and unmoved.
Learningg of his mother's mental health dillusions and illness, with the empathy and sensitivity Joaquin's portrayal had would not garner this result. If there is one word I could use to describe this movie, particularly in character development and directing, it is ""inconsistency."" Not worth the hype. "

3322," Ignore the haters, it's a masterpiece.
",
3323," Entertaining, but missing a key piece of the Joker's origin story
"," I give this film 7 stars for the entertainment value it offers to comic book fans: it rivets and delights us with a series of absorbing, well-crafted, competently executed scenes about one of the most revered and iconic villains in the DC Comics universe.<br/><br/>The acting of Phoenix, De Niro and Beetz expertly straddles the line between the sensibilities of a modern movie-going audience in 2019 and the campy, 1940s comic-book villain reality of the Joker's story (presented to us in the gritty atmosphere of New York in the late 70s / early 80s), while the writing of Phillips and Silver easily draws us into the psychological world of their main character.<br/><br/>Where the movie fails, however, to reach from ""decent"" to ""excellent"" is within the frame of its own stated purpose (as related in interviews with writer / director Todd Phillips): the film is supposed to render a realistic account of how a relatively unremarkable man like Arthur Fleck might have become the super-villain that we know as ""The Joker."" Unfortunately, the movie ends with this task only partially complete.<br/><br/>The movie successfully describes the first step of Arthur's transition. It shows Arthur's physical, mental and economic vulnerability in the context of an uncaring, exploitative society; it shows a human being in Arthur who is preyed upon by greater forces in his environment; and it shows Arthur's (relatable) reaction to these forces. It is a violent reaction, one which transforms him into an ""early stage"" Joker: a physically and mentally scarred individual who has learned to use violence against those who would harm him (subway scene), obstruct him (Wayne manor scene) or seek to profit at his expense (apartment scene, talk show scene).<br/><br/>Where the movie disappoints us, however, is that it never delivers the final piece of the puzzle of Arthur's transition and The Joker's character: what is it that drives Arthur / Joker to use violence for its own sake (e.g. final scene)? What is it that pushes Arthur beyond self-defensive reactions to his environment, into the perversely artistic appreciation of violent chaos and its possibilities that we recognize wherever the Joker appears in our favorite Batman comic books?<br/><br/>In recent interviews, both (director) Phillips and (actor) Phoenix admitted that they did not have a full grasp on Fleck's / Joker's motivations during the making of this film. However, surely it was a key part of Phillips' and (co-author) Scott Silver's professional responsibility as writers to track the psychological development of their main character all the way to its notorious - and eminently recognizable - final state.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that I subtract 3 stars from my rating: this movie presents us with a job that is only half-done in regards to describing the origin of the villain we know as The Joker. It is well worth watching for comic book fans - and all fans of story-telling - nonetheless. "
3324," Not bad, but doesn't live up to the considerable hype
"," High marks for the acting all around, and the story is believable. That said, I can't appreciate it as a comic book adaptation. It's not a BATMAN story and not really a Joker story either. The Joker has always been a chemicals expert and an over-the-top manic; this movie doesn't even touch on the science background and Phoenix's portrayal of Joker's personality is the most subdued I can remember seeing. I consider this a better-than-average re-imagining. If at some point after the movie events the Joker does morph into a cackling, narcissistic showman, we aren't shown any clues of how he arrives there.
I remember the movie trailer saying it was rated R for ""strong, bloody violence""; I have to say I've seen FAR worse in that respect. As far as the FBI's concern of it spawning violence, I'm not seeing any greater danger of that from this movie than any other crime drama. "
3325," Excellent performance but the film was hollow
", Joaquin's performance was top notch but the movie story was absolutely weak. It just touched on enough subjects to give fuel to the fire so to speak but didnt have anything poignant or interesting to say besides your cliched ideas on mental illness.

"," Ages 12-35 will love this movie. Like seemingly every other character study in Hollywood, it exaggerates the impact of poor parenting and bullying to appeal to the masses who feel a certain way about how poorly their life has gone. The movie wanted to be realistic and gritty, but it wasn't. If just one person could show me where all of these 30 year olds who are getting bullied for doing their jobs are, maybe it would validate some of the ridiculousness.
Using a famous character unnecessarily to make this movie is another issue I took. Creativity is lacking though, and money must be made, so I digress.
The pacing was decent, but the first 1.5 hours were almost too boring to stay awake though. The redeeming quality was the acting, though not ""Oscar worthy"". Phoenix almost always turns in a good performance as one of the more versatile actors. "

You can have a good acting performance (in this case Joaquin Phoenix) andbat the same time have an, IMO, very average film labeled as a DC film aka a comic book film but really it just being a character film of th making of a serial killer. In this case Joker is absolutely false advertisement. Should have been called Arthur or Decent into Madness. I went in expecting a complex story and what o got was a mix of Taxi Driver, King of Comedy, some Joker Gotham tie ins and an,IMO weak script and plot. I will be in the minority in this age of hype but this movie is not on the scale of true masterpieces like Se7en, Leon, The Usual Suspects. Joaquin may get nominated for awards but as film I would not nominate this film due to its weak script. The best in the film, the acting of Joaquin and the cinematography. Everything else is meh. "

3350," Not half as intelligent or socially relevant as it thinks it is.
"," Joker is trying really hard to be more than it is. It endeavors a movie about a mentally ill man who resorts to violence as a result of an unsympathetic society wrought with ruthless bullying, an inadequate healthcare system, socioeconomic inequality, and political disillusion. A movie about a man traumatized by his detachment and misunderstanding of the world, painfully seeking some type of acceptance through entertaining others, chasing an unattainable ambition of living his dream, and winning love and admiration just by simply being himself. This is what Joker wants to be, and this what Joker halfway is, but the sad truth is that Joker is doomed to never able to flesh out any of these concepts. Its never able to make any truly relevant commentary in reference to these concepts. Because the character, Joker, doesn't have the type of mental illness that subtly or tragically allows his character to explore any of its larger sociological themes. Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is disabled, disillusioned, and truly from a disadvantaged upbringing, but he is too insane for the film to truly say anything about these concepts. Joker has more in common with Hannibal Lector than he does a real world schizophrenic patient. His violent tendencies are there from the start, and as you learn later in the movie, his delusions and hallucinations are hereditary rather than a result of his treatment. Gotham is painted as cruel and uncaring towards Joker, but he is the one who endangers children, repeatedly violating other's privacy, and murders helpless family members. The movie tries to make the point that it is sympathy Joker needs, but despite therapy, being on several medications and support from family and co workers, he still finds himself spiraling towards violence. It doesn't take long for Joker to become a killing machine; less a victim of circumstance and more an inevitable villain in the making. The ideas this film attempts to portray are indeed relevant and important, but the biggest mistake was using such a sinister villain as their conduit. In the end Joker was always going to be heartless mass murderer, and the trouble for the film maker was making that be a reasonable and sympathetic transformation that could communicate anything about society or real mental illness. They piled so much on Joker's ethos that every social commentary becomes lost in his truly off-the-wall insanity and maniacal tendencies. They try to make his violence so justified that when the poor lower classes of Gotham rally behind Joker's murders, but these people come off as more criminally insane rather than the poor desolate lower class desperate for equality. All that's left in the end is a Joker who's too villainous to say anything relevant about society, but at the same time too meek to pose any credible threat to Batman in his inevitable future. "

3354," Cinematography, art direction, and the performance of Phoenix are the draws here; the story is so derivative, drawn out, empty, and vapid that it drags the film's biggest faul
"," After his big surprise win in Venice, a big splash (and some backlash) in Toronto, a storm (in a teacup) of opinion on social media, self-generating fear of cinema violence and even an incel insurrection, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by Todd Phillips of The Hangover, arrives at a resounding ""hm"" on our screens. Indeed, if you've seen both Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, there's really nothing for you, as Joker doesn't even update their concerns for our own troubled age, aping those movies and squatting between them in 1980.<br/><br/>Cinematography, art direction, and the performance of Phoenix are the draws here; the story is so derivative, drawn out, empty, and vapid that it drags the film's biggest fault. There was wit and style in Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy; Joker has no wit and his style is stolen. His tale of a poor down-trodden urban comedian descending into violence has often been told, with minor variations, and resonance to real-life events, most specifically to Bernhard Goetz's ""subway vigilante,"" comes with no insight. Ugliness is just for its own sake on display here.<br/><br/>This film's best takeaway is as a set-up for a future Batman (like we need another one).The final scenes are suitably baroque, appropriate to the origin story of the Joker as being operatically linked to the story of Bruce Wayne; try as Phillips, his marketing team, and everybody else at Warner Bros. may have to deny it, this is just another comic book movie, in a darker key than usual. "
3355," This movie is so dull, is the director the real Joker?
"," Pretty close-ups of Joaquim Phoenix, if that's what you want to see, you'll get 2 hours of it here. The worst kind of movies are the ones label 'character studies', because then you are expected to like it because the lead actor literally hogs the spotlight the entire movie. There's no room for supporting actors in that type of film, you have to sit and watch the movie evolve around that one actor. The last few Daniel Day Lewis movies have suffered that same ailment.
On top of that, this movie just rips off Scorsese with no shame. News flash: If we've seen it before, it's NOT new. Homage or straight theft? You decide. Or not, just avoid this one. "

"," Wasted my time watching this movie.
The movie tried to create a tragic character, however I could not sympathize. The live of Arthur isn't that bad. Lots of ppl would do everything for such a life in a first world country.
Arthur is crazy, yes, but even that was nothing special. What a waste of time making this a movie. "
3357," The Clown Prince of Whine
"," My review has nothing to do with the phony controversy. I felt this movie, as a stand alone, was mediocre. The aesthetic of the film was well made. But, the acting by Phoenix annoyed me. I kept waiting for The Joker to show up - but he was very whiney and lame. The writing was not very good. Lots of plot convince. However, if they expanded on this universe and made it more interesting this could serve as a good origin story. I would like to see a Joker v Batman movie with this versions of Joker to expand the lore. Hopefully that comes. "
3358," Bad movie
"," The Best thing in this movie just the music
And the Scenario is not good "
3359," A movie that has nothing to say but won't stop talking
"," I feel like I've seen a different movie to everyone else because the Joker I seen was not a hauntingly dark masterpiece with excellent character development that breaks the mould of the genre. The Joker I seen was one which is so pretentious and pleased with itself that it has made a ""deep"" movie about how society is filled with empty promises that it doesn't seem to realise it has artificially made itself ""deep"" as it doesn't really have anything new or interested to say. its an unoriginal overrated wannabe artsy film that borrows so heavily from superior films (Fight Club, Taxi Driver) that it gives the illusion of a great film. This artificial idea that this is more than a movie and the try hard artsy elements will be enough to impress some but those who scratch just beneath the surface will release this movie is filled with nothing but old copies of Taxi Driver, Fight Club and dead wasps. "
3360," On of the greatest movies in the 21 century
"," It was amazing but i am giving 1 star because he didn't say ""we live in society"" when he stands up on the police car "
3361," Terrible Waste of Time
"," As a comic movie this falls flat on its face. This is no villain.. Just a sad, pathetic loser. If not for the words Gotham and Wayne thrown around a few times, it wouldve nothing to do with the Batman universe at all.. Its a mediocre drama with a well playing Phoenix, but not more. For this it's overly long and dissapointingly missing any interesting content. "
3362," Worst movie I've ever seen
"," This is clearly not my kind of movie.
I thought it was bad and slow.<br/><br/>I've seen better. "

3364," Unfortunate, Boring, not worth the time
"," There were a number of aesthetically nice scenes, but otherwise it was pretty boring to watch JP laugh like a hyena for 2 hours straight. "
3365," The Real Lunatic in Joker
"," I would have loved to see The Joker, but that washed-up lunatic Robert DeNiro is in it!
His presence ruins the movie for me. Seeing him makes me want to punch him in the face!
There are literaly hundreds of capable actors who could have played his part.
Why in this Great America of ours would any studio hire a washed-up lunatic like DeNiro in what would otherwise be a great film?! "
3366," This movie deserve the oscar
"," Very well directed, very well photography, joaquin phoenix deserve the oscar, well soundtrack, and i just wanna say, this movie is a masterpiece. "
3367," Where Is The Beauty Of Art In This Motion Picture?
"," Even though the directing and acting were really good, the whole message of this movie was rather bad, dark and depressing. There's no solution found that makes the movie meaningful! As if it supports the grotesque, ugliness and cruelty among the human nature.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed that I saw that piece of art! "
3368," A brilliant, disturbing masterpiece
"," It's ties to the batman universe are it's weakest aspects but as a character piece on a poor, mentally-ill man slowly losing his mind, the film is a masterpiece. The movie does an incredible job of dragging you in and making you feel how Aurthur feels and the tremendous musical score deserves a lot of credit for supporting this. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. "
3369," Disappointing as the origin of Joker
"," The movie lost me when they start with Arthur as a mental patient. He is a mentally unstable person on seven medications and with an uncontrollable laugh! To be honest this laughter concept was the show stopper for me. The Joker (let alone heath ledger, this is valid for every possible DC comic Joker) laugh because he is cruel, crazy, kind of a monster, master manipulator, mocking the society and order. The Joker I can imagine, laughs at a witty joke or double meaning sentence or he gets fun creating an anarchy. The real Joker laugh is not a laugh where he has no control over it, or he has no sense of humor kind of stuff! Real Joker is smart and he CAN laugh intentionally. At the very first occurrence of Arthur's involuntary laughter, I just stopped to take the movie seriously as a Joker.<br/><br/>Next, there is no character development. The movie focuses to Arthur for almost 95% of the time. There is hardly any description about the society (yes, the set was dark and gloomy like any other average movie, but that doesn't depict the time, except some cliche rich-poor differences). Not a single other character got any attention. Fine, It's Joker, and they focused only a single person Arthur. Yet, for Arthur, there was no development. He was on seven medication, lost job, got financial cut-off for his medicine, killed few people accidentally and become criminal minded. He outburst when he found his mother was also a mental patient and the reason of his all ill-fates. Ok, this justifies his being a criminal and get aviated from his morals. But, this is not enough for him to be THE JOKER. A mental patient without medicine becomes dumb, out of mind and mostly dysfunctional. He does not suddenly become smart enough to plan and manipulate people (let alone bat man). Even, they did not portray a mentally ill person properly. There was exaggerated melodrama on what goes on with in the mind of a mentally ill person. Anyway, the reason for an idiot, insecure, previously non-violent become an intelligent master manipulator, sophisticated well-planned killer was not there.<br/><br/>Phoenix's acting as a Joker was good, but there were few scenes where it seems too much overacting and unnecessary. For example, his dance moves - those are unnecessary. Yes, they are good to watch and he did them well, but they have zero relation with the plot/environment and they convey zero meaning. The director put them there just because they look crazy. Heath Ledger's joker was effortless, his acting was just natural, audience hardly felt it was an acting. Phoenix was good, but you can see the strains and efforts he puts in to the character.<br/><br/>About the plot, there are lot's of loopholes. Arthur's mom is a mental patient too. There is no reason for her to write such a meaning full complete letter and the forget to post it just to find Arthur the letter. The period where there was a chance for Joker being the step-brother of Batman was really creepy. In comics, Thomas Wayne was actually careful about Gotham. But here, they portrayed him as the main reason behind Gotham's chaos - rich vs poor riot. His stand for the riches and view point was just one dimensional. It's not clear why the colleague will give Arthur a gun? That colleague seems to care about him, but later, he tried to push him in front of a bus; weird! Joker even had a sense of good and bad. He killed the colleague who did bad to him and spared the midget one because he was always good to him - certainly not a Joker character. Yes, if you remove DC and the name Joker from the movie, make it just and ordinary movie where a mental patient goes through some unfortunate events and eventually does some criminal act, then this is a good one. But, this is certainly not that movie, where an individual turns into a JOKER. "
3370," Not sure what to make of it
",
3371," Some people will be disappointed
"," I'll make it short:
Pro: JP is outstanding and truly deserves an Oscar
Pro: cinematography and musical score
Con: It doesn't follow the Comic narrative
Con: the supporting actors are not well casted (Robert de Niro is really bad)
Con: sometimes repetitive and too low paced<br/><br/>This is actually a superhero movie for people who don't care about superheroes. Very brave to make such a dark movie and risking that the comic fans will be disappointed. "
3372," Possibly a modern masterpiece
"," A sharp, refreshing and disturbing detour from a decade of comic book family adventures. You'll find no candyfloss or 1 dimensional villains here. You'll find a painfully real story of a mentally ill outcast pushed too far, while the city and its social services crumble from neglect. Phoenix gives an oscar worthy performance in his portrayal of a man turning from childlike hope and vulnerability to madness, strength, vengeance and darkness. "
3373," So glad this movie delivered up to all the hype :)
"," A masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this one... "
3374," Instant classic
"," This is the best film I've seen in years and best acting (from Phoenix). It is a very carefully crafted film and it's clear that everyone who worked on it loved this project.
For the entirety of the film I forgot about my surroundings forgot that I was sitting in the movie theatre. I felt like I was living Arthur's life or that I'm watching him up close in person.
Phoenix is a true artist and the whole cast and crew should be VERY, AWFULLY proud of what they've given birth to. I applaud them. (Don't miss this film! Go and see it NOW!) "
3375," Simply a masterpiece
"," Sometimes when you read Or hear critics hyping a movie Or perfomance, you go and See it and get dissapointed, But with This Joker movie, Theres Not much other to say than Its a Masterpiece. "
3376," Surpassed even the best of expectations
"," This movie is a masterpiece!
I remember when the first teaser for this movie came out all i saw was negative reactions and confused faces, i went into this movie having it spoilt for me beforehand and even having it spoilt for me i can strongly say this is the best movie I've seen in a long long time and i just hope that future movies, mainly superhero movies will look at this for inspiration and stir away from the blank boring platform they all seem to have nowadays "
3377," It is difficult to describe the unbelievable awesomeness of Phoenix in the title role.

3379," Disturbingly beautiful.
"," Story, acting, soundtrack and the picture. All amazing. "
3380," A Thought Provoking Masterpiece
",
3381," Unbelievably Good
"," I had high expectations and they were exceeded. Take the Joker aspect of this film out of the equation, and I'd simply describe this as a Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix, of The descent into madness and psychosis of a man allowed to slip through the cracks.<br/><br/>This film completely adds on every level to a joker character. The comparisons between Bruce's charmed life turned tragedy, to the Authur's never had a chance, trampled, abused and tormented from birth.<br/><br/>This film works on so many levels. From a class war perspective. With the perfect veneer of the Wayne Dynasty allowed to slip and looked upon from the perspective of those with nothing. This was really interesting and is the first time we are allowed to see a billionaire industrialist philanthropist being much like you'd expect a billionaire to be like.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect of the film was the view point of mental health and how it's viewed and prioritised. Much like we see in the world today, these terrible spirals could be avoided with good social services and health care. But when we allow children to be abused and brought up in abusive households. When we allow support for people with mental health issues to slip through the cracks and to live unsupported outside of medicating correctly and being cared for, this can be a consequence.<br/><br/>Finally the Victorian philosophy of serving up the mentally ill for ridicule for entertainment purposes. As the joker calls it. In a cruel world where no one cares for each other, the mainstream get to set what's acceptable not acceptable and what's funny or not funny. The reality is this usually oozes hypocrisy. I feel like I could watch this film a few more times and take much more from.<br/><br/>If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar he's been robbed. "
3382," Breathtaking
"," Towering performance from Phoenix that launches him into the rarfied atmosphere of exceptional actors. There are only a handful of people who can be compared to him.
Any attempt to summarise the plot would be an insult to the movie. Possibly the best movie I have ever seen.
Oscars for Phoenix and therapy for the screenwriters and director. You must see this movie... "
3383," Absolute masterpiece
"," While watching the movie, I felt things that I never felt before. "
3384," Masterpiece
"," This movie is just brilliant. It came up to be one of the best films done in the decade. Its direction and photography are really pleasing and excellent. Joaquin Phoenix acting is spectacular. And it's a powerful competitor for the Best Actor in a Leading Role and the movie itself for the Best Picture award. When I saw this movie it remembered me a lot to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) due to its cinematic references to the classic. It was definitely worth the money and time. And after years of a lot of superhero movies coming from Marvel Studios, this one comes (in my opinion) as a very needful type of movie these days. A serious, dark, with a bit of funny moments movie. To see Arthur Fleck A.K.A. Joker, (Joaquin Phoenix) transform from a relatively ""normal"" guy to a crazy, obscure man because of all the revelations and life problems he has to go through, is just, as mentioned before, brilliant. Also adding that the script, was written as a new origin for Batman's enemy, the direction and acting from Phoenix and that its final minutes are just excellent, makes this movie as named in the title, an authentic masterpiece. "

"," First time reviewing anything on here.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this film being made I was disappointed. No one would ever level Heath Ledger in my eyes. Not even Whacheem Phoenix. The movie posters did nothing for me either but a 2 for one cinema ticket deal entice me in.<br/><br/>The film is dark and that's not a metaphor. Its filmed with the least amount of light possible. Obviously to fit the ambience of the film but wow it's dark.<br/><br/>Now the performance I got started as desperation for acceptance to hopelessness to final disregard of what you want, I'm just going to be me. I was rooting for him at the end. This guy tried but every avenue for him was always going to take him to the path he ended up on. There was no choice for him. And he didn't need a load of CGI to get there! I'm a confessed Marvel fan. I love superheroes and the mythology that goes with it but this time I didn't need bells and whistles to get there.<br/><br/>It left me sad and upset but it left me fully understanding WHY the Joker is who he is and why he will always reign in chaos. Joaquin I salute you. "

3398," A one-man show for workhorse Phoenix
"," Throughout his career, Joaquin Phoenix has become an acting establishment for playing challenging yet relatable people; this still holds true for his portrayal of on becoming The Joker. This, however, does not excuse the film from not fleshing-out the rest of the cast who play out their parts like comic book characters. "

", Outstanding... Excellent... Should easily get Oscars. 
3402," Not a masterpiece, but a very good film
"," Joker is an excellent character study of a man who is descending into a dark madness. It's central theme of how society treats the mentally ill is very strong and well done, and full props must be given to Joaquin Phoenix for his excellent performance.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film though. It borrows heavily from other sources, and the themes go deep, but not as deep as they maybe could have. Also, the Joker character at the end didn't quite feel right as the movie never took him past angry personal revenge killings to become the outright and indiscriminate psychopath that he is supposed to be.<br/><br/>If you only watch comic book films then this will seem truly mind blowing, but for seasoned cinephiles, it's been done better in other movies. Still, that doesn't take away from what is maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good film - and there's nothing wrong with being a very good film. "
3403," Society
"," It's an ok movie, Joaquin gives an amazing performance as the joker. However, it doesn't hold a candle to the cinematic masterpiece that is Scooby-Doo 2 monsters unleashed. Joaquin's performance also pales when compared to Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy Rogers. "

",
3405," Wow...
"," This is a movie about everything...Bullying, society, rejection, politics, mental illness and so on. Joaquin Phoenix was unbelievable...one of the best acting performances of all times.

3408," Give this man already an Oscar

"," It could have been a dark movie about someone slowly going insane, but since the main character is the cartoon character Joker, the way in which the main character actualy goes insane is not realistic at all, transforming to the Joker instead.
As such it is pretentious, trying way too hard to be serious, while being almost comical at the same time, because of the Joker makeup, but failing at that too, because of the dark undertone.
About halfway, I was considering leaving the movie theatre, asking for my money back, but decided to stay, not wanting to cause a fuzz.
In hindsight I wish I would have walked out, because the second half is even worse than the first half.
All in all, watching this weird movie was a serious waste of money... "

3428," A movie that didn't need to be made.
"," Although Joaquin Phoenix did an incredible job, this backstory trip into the pathos of the Joker could have been achieved equally as well with a few lines in another movie. It's incredibly predictable. I am one who doesn't mind a slow brewing movie as long as there's a point to it, which this movie achieved in its first slow closeup. Every one after that was like, ""here, you want some more slow? How about an extra serving of maudlin? Would you like some whine with that?"" "

Clearly is not an action movie but more of a psychological one. A lot of ""daddy issues"" with a guy who refuses to go and find help for his mental disability.
He goes on and blames society for him not being able to face reality and seek help. Always is easier to blame others than yourself. "
3436," A dark spot in a sea of dualities.
"," The Joker navigates in that sea, being a descending path. But the related thread that guides him in a true way is not found. Madness, plagued with superficiality, not by Phoenix's performance, but by forcing his way, trying to justify his feeling and acting, giving an overrated power to injustice, inequality and hypocrisy. The film tries to give the same place to a rebellious society, fighting for a justice that tries to derive the unjust power of the system, centered on the rich, to make them suffer. But just as the path of the Joker is forced, so is the path of this suffered society. It is like a black drop in the sea that instead of being diluted multiplies. "

3447," Should've rated it a 1
"," This film is not good regardless of what critics say for this over the edge Oscar push. There are many scenes where the film is dead and we go into a 70's themed song and orchestra playing in the background as we have guess what the joker is thinking. In terms of acting and bringing the character to life, that's an A+, but in terms of playing the character to best of its ability C+. The overall film as a whole was just slow to unbuckle and very hard to read, but the music controlled the emotions and the scenes as does anything with this director and assistance from Martin Scorsese. All and All I guess people will overact because of the Buzzkill Marvel has brought into the cinema world. "
3448," Great acting, poor writing.
", Joaquin Phoenix did a phenomenal job as The Joker. The only bad things is that the movie was boring. The rumors about people walking out because of violence is probably false. People probably walked out because of falling asleep in it. There were a few snorers at the showing I wear to. One of them was almost me. The writing is the biggest problem. I have no idea what timeline they were following. The joker was like 40 years old so that means that when Batman is 20-30 Joker will be 50-60 which is not ok. They did not stay true to anything except the birth of Batman and even that wasn't 100%. It seems like they tried to rewrite the whole Joker backstory and giving him a name and saying he's just mentally ill is not the way to go it seems. Good job Joaquin Phoenix. He deserves an Oscar for his acting in this role. 
3449," Only Hype!
"," I was underwhelmed by the movie. The acting, no doubt, was superb. The emotions were raw and the message about mental illness and social apathy resonated with me. But the plot was predictable, the screenplay was mediocre and the shots were narcissistic and over-indulgent. "
3450," The joke is on us
"," While this, for all intent and purposes, is an art house film, it is wrapped neatly in the packaging of a DC comic. That is my gripe. If this film was called 'Arthur' I'd have liked it. This film rode the comic book genre and, as the director has confirmed, will not follow through and engage with the concept. Original concepts are rare nowadays and this film only reaffirms that. Taxi driver and king of comedy are masterpieces. This is an homage at best. That said, Phoenix's physical performance deserves praise.
I liked this film but it felt like it was making a statement and not trying to entertain me. "
3451," Taxi Driver remake with clown make up
"," Take away the clown element and this is a superb psychological thriller about descent into madness. But there's nothing apart from the odd Wayne references to connect this to anything Batman related. In the same way Nolan's Batman were bond movies in rubber suits. This is just a personal preference, but I'm not interested in comic book stories grounded in reality. I think it's lazy. Give me fantasy, take me out of the real world for 2 hours. I know this probably an unpopular view but I'm just being honest. This movie has some amazing performances in it and is very brave in places, but it's better viewed separately from anything comic book related. "

3454," Few things amiss
"," Loved the movie. Loved the portrayal and development of the character of Joker by Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>On the storyline, its been super gripping, there were places where I felt they were being slow. Hallucinations was critical in building of the movie, initially, i was not able to understand, but then towards the second half the clarity of the distinction of what is real became apparent.<br/><br/>Background Score, Hans Zimmer was missed, Using mix of ""Send in the Clowns"" by Frank Sinatra, ""White Room"" by Cream and whole host of music which clearly instilled within the scenes, exemplified. We were actually sympathising with the Joker.<br/><br/>Few observations -
* Missed the the simplicity, poetic, rhythm in dialogues that the Joker character uses. The dialogues need to be simple and hugely impactful at both individual level and at the level of Gotham. Nothing immediately memorable.<br/><br/>* I cannot imagine Joker smoking, the entire movie he seems to be smoking. he could be high on medication or any other drug but incessant smoking on screen, may be shows is dependancy, but when he is crowned the Joker, no more of scenes smoking.<br/><br/>* Another thing, i dont think Joker would even use cuss words for an impact. His expressions, his menacing silence, his way of telling is enough, could have completely avoided using any cuss word.<br/><br/>* Touching upon mental disease, where we are just getting used to the idea ""its ok, not to be ok"" - it brings in a sensitivity towards the this aspect of life, where we all need a balance.<br/><br/>** Spoiler Alert**
* The shooting in the subway, OR in front live audience is unlike him. The Joker would plan, strategise but will get things executed by others. Maybe that is what was needed to build it up.<br/><br/>The other problem that i have with the character of Joker is that we all live in the world of paradox - where we/I got to choose - to be strong, face the truth OR to be weak and shoot the person because he was mean to us. So is it ok to shoot, hit, the person because he was mean to us? A lot of questions that gives rise to the the individual in you, after the watching the movie. So, if someone shouts at you, bangs your car, you go ahead and give a him a punch. This is still work of fiction but based on some level of truth as to how we are actually becoming - shallow! "
3455," My Majesty Is Zero
"," Ah yes, who needs colours and big time movie sets to film The Joker ?<br/><br/>A madman in a madhouse. The madhouse next doors. Next time you see green and white guy, better run. Better run now I say.<br/><br/>Want a Michael Mayers, Jason or The Joker mask ? How about a boring drama thriller centered on chequered floors. The cherry on top is an old ninja guy dressed as a bat, with a cool car and lots of gothic movie sets. Oh how I love it.... "
3456," A grimy take on comic book films that misses it's potential
"," DC has gone for that ""gritty"" dark style as opposed to Marvel's bright and colourful style. One outcome is that DC films have become dour affairs, and another is that Marvel films are very superficial when it comes to characters.<br/><br/>Joker continues in the DC vein, and hats off to Warner Bros for swinging for the fences with a film like this. It's a bold choice, but unfortunately it also falls short of said fence. At time of writing it has a 9.4 rating here and that is way, way to generous. This is a 7 rated film at best.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is great as the titular character. The overall story is good, if a bit hardcore, at least compared to most comic book movies. This really isn't a comic-book movie, despite having notable comic book characters. It's a very realistic take on the origins of the Joker, and on that note it's a great effort.<br/><br/>The real tragedy of this film is that's it's really close to being great, but falls short. The violence is a bit too realistic to be enjoyable in the way that James Bond, Mission Impossible or even Marvel films are. There's only a few violent scenes, but they're stripped back and raw. It definitely deserves it's hard R rating, but there's no fun either.<br/><br/>The world of Joker focuses tightly on Phoenix and the un-comfortableness of mental illness. The Joker's character is not unlikable for most of the film, but he is not likeable either. This makes the film watchable, but not necessarily enjoyable. Aside from some great cinematography and shots, there's no parts that you'll think back on and go ""Wow, I'd like to see that again.""<br/><br/>The problem with such a tight focus on the main character is that it eschews creating a setting for that character. With so many incendiary elements in today's world (Black Lives Matter, anti-capitalism, a sense of disconnection from each other etc) that could be mined for fuel, the writers chose the most unrealistic elements instead. Rather than creating situations that feel real for the characters to inhabit, the film instead chooses two-dimensional set pieces that fall flat and are unsatisfying.<br/><br/>To wit, most people do not go crazy at the drop of a hat. Take the 1992 LA riots. There had been simmering tensions for some time, and all it needed was a spark. When that spark came, the whole city exploded. The spark in Joker is both too weak to inflame a city, and too unnatural. The anti-capitalist sentiments are not allowed to fester with the audience, and thus the final settings in the film of the ""revolution"" are fake and unearned. If the writer's/director had done that simple thing of adding a little more context and meat to the Joker's world, it would have made the rioter's worship of a homicidal manic a little more understandable.<br/><br/>This film made me think of Taxi Driver, but with some notable differences. In that film, De Niro's Travis Bickle is an olden day incel, but is at least redeemed by a 'noble' act - saving Iris - however twisted his motives were. It presents both a character that most people wouldn't like, but manages to make him into a good guy, in only because he does what people wish would happen and he's better than the really bad guys.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck by comparison is offered no such redemption. That would actually be okay if at least the world which he inhabits connected with us. Instead however, rich people are jerks, and the rioters are shown without any real context. They're rioting, but against what? Random anti-capitalism that we're supposed to recognise? There's always been rich people and poor people, but that's not what sets off riots. What sets off riots is (at least a sense of) injustice. There's certainly opportunism by some in those situations, but that comes after the fact.<br/><br/>Fleck's first victims did nothing worthy of inciting riots and mayhem - they were boorish jerks worthy of contempt, but not burning a city down. There have been riots and protests against capitalism in the real world, but they all have context. Random, un-contextualized mayhem is unsatisfying, especially in a film that goes to such lengths to delve into it's character's psyche. Maybe that was the point; the very people who torment Arthur are the same people who worship him at the end. Everyone is irredeemable and everything is chaos.<br/><br/>This is where the film truly failed for me though. The Joker as a realistic, insane, delusional character is a low-key take on the supervillain genre, but it works. I like that DC are going down the darker path. Is he an incel? I guess so. I can see how it could be construed to glorify horrific actions, but I really do think that those who claim that (the incel part, there's more than enough movie violence to inspire people everywhere) are reading into the film something that really isn't there. Senseless violence, yes, but not everything else (that I'm told) comes with the incel losers on Reddit. There's no violence towards women, no moralising on the excesses of sex in the media and so on.<br/><br/>So yeah, hard R. Realistic depictions of violence. A stripped back origin story. And completely un-enjoyable to watch. Taxi Driver was saved by Bickle's redemption, but his world was understandable. Fleck didn't need that redemption (since he is in fact a supervillain and quite insane), but his world is half-baked and lazy. "

3464," Complete disaster and opposite of the trailer
"," Well, I was one of the guy who spent last month expecting this movie, watching trailer again and again. I have to admit, they got me as everyone else with this trailer.<br/><br/>Acting is brilliant. No doubt about it. For acting the part, he deserves an Oscar but movie itself is disaster and quite opposite of the trailer.<br/><br/>The movie is sending wrong message. First, Joker went crazy because he has been abused. They distorted his mind and created schizophrenic persona by abuse they gave him when he was a child.<br/><br/>Second, when he committed the crime out of defence, how that crime sent positive message to people of Gotham ? Why would any society support this evil act even without knowing who and why committed it at first please ? Killing is not to be supported.
Why would society attack the rich ? Is this movie on new agenda which is going on and hitting the wealthiest people in real life ?<br/><br/>Joker was crazy even before this, later he showed his complete evil and destructive behaviour but scene after scene, plot of the movie does not have sense at all.<br/><br/>Man kills, people support killings, man again kills and kills and at the end he ends up in mental hospital.<br/><br/>I went out of theatre before it finished.<br/><br/>It is dark, violent, misleading ( trailer ) , bad vibes all over the place.<br/><br/>I had to watch Bob Proctor after this movie to return my happy look in this world because world is not as it is showed in Joker.

"," Joaquin Phoenix doesn't put a clown shoe shod foot wrong in this exceptional film. The tension builds &amp; builds to reach a crescendo well worth waiting for.

It should show some people that not everyone sees the world the same way &amp; that those people shouldn't be sidelined for it. Possibly one of the best films ever made. 10 stars at least. "

3482," Best Joker So Far?

3483," Joaquin Phoenix is incredible.
"," Just by watching this movie you can tell that Joaquin Phoenix makes every effort possible to perfect his role as the iconic Joker. He makes the viewing experience incredibly uncomfortable but in all the best ways. The viewer truely feels that Joaquin is actually psychotic and mentally deranged. Viewers will compare him to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson's portrayal, but each Joker is beautiful in their own way; there is no comparison.<br/><br/>10/10 "
3484," Cinematic masterpiece 10/10
", This is a legendry movie. You don't want to miss it in cinema. It is all perfect. Nothing is bad or missed. 
3485," Wonderful movie
"," Brilliant stuff. Phoenix deserves to walk to the Oscar, an absolutely masterful immersive performance, suffocating and honest. Leaves nothing in the back pocket, it's all hanging out there on screen. Perfectly paced throughout, loved the base filled score, never rushed, lingered when it needed to. Blasts into violence on occasion, but didn't feel like a violet movie, rather a study in frustration, disappointment and directionlessness. And at the heart, it's observation of 'mental illness' (should that be in quotes?), how people who are 'different' are shunned, isolated and I guess feared by much of the population who prefer not to have to deal with behaviour they don't understand. There is a back story, its disturbing, the behaviour has roots in the past. There are reasons to be sympathetic. But also to be wary of, because there is a madness there, just below the surface, with the potential to tip into the mainstream if the conditions are right. if a certain sequence of events open the door.
Just go an watch it. "
3486," The best performance I've seen in decades
"," Having never seen a Batman film in my life, I wasn't sure I'd like this.
Oh my God, I was gripped.
The whole atmosphere of this masterpiece is electric, and Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising.
If you haven't done so already, go and watch it. "
3487," MY MIND IS BLOWN!
"," Just finished watching it, and oh boy, Joaquin delivered, and I can't sress this enough, one of the best preformances I've seen in a long time! Oscar material! "
3488," Not a Masterpiece
"," A film which wants to be The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, but doesn't live up to either. It is rather hollow and simplistic, and doesn't do justice to the character of the joker who's asset is his intelligence.<br/><br/>The film feels like a screenplay based on a loner called Arthur Fleck, which was later adapted to fit in the DC comic book universe. Sadly those sort of film rarely get financial backing these days.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it looks amazing and displays another great performance by Joaquin Pheonix, although not close to his work in PTA's The Master.<br/><br/>The shot near the end of Joker painting his smile with blood is worth the ticket price. A holy moment. "

3494," INCREDIBLE
", Easily the best movie I've seen this year. Joaquin is amazing. Todd Phillip's crafts a magnificent film. Dont listen to the haters. GO SEE THIS FLICK 
3495," I have a condition
"," This movie makes it easy to pity the Joker. I felt sorry for him throughout the whole film but the part that made me pity him the most was when he tried to explain why he's laughing on the train and his two assailants just assaulted him without even trying to understand him. I imagine many people would probably pity him more when he tries to do stand up and his compulsive laughter interferes but for me, the little moment where he was trying to explain that he has a condition and desperately asking for a little compassion before getting his ass kicked was more upsetting. Whenever he laughs, it sounds like he's close to crying and the only time his laugh seems like one of genuine amusement, rather than just a result of his condition, is when he's on the talk show with Murray Franklin. Even his laugh in the asylum at the end seems like a pained kind of laughter like he still knows that his life is a tragedy and he's trying to turn it into a comedy.<br/><br/>Is Joaquin Phoenix a better Joker than Heath Ledger? Hard to say. They both have very different approaches and while Heath's Joker will always be iconic, Joaquin's Joker actually makes you feel sorry for him whilst also holding a mirror up to the ugliness in society. Yes, The Dark Knight did the latter but you never pity the Joker in that movie and his commentary on society was conveyed through his dialogue. In this movie, they show it. The assaults on Arthur in the streets and on the trains, Murray making fun of him and then forgetting that he'd done so because of how little he cared about Arthur's feelings, Thomas Wayne pretending he wants to help ""the clowns"" whilst also talking down to them and outright punching Arthur in the face when he just wants to form a relationship with him, it all reflects how messed up our society is right now. Switch ""the clowns"" with struggling people in real life and it shows that politicians and Hollywood will often talk big but 90% of them don't actually care about helping people less fortunate than themselves.<br/><br/>With all that said, Arthur Fleck isn't just a victim of tragic circumstances. It's easy to feel sorry for him but the movie never shies away from the fact that he's a dangerous man. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is very human, showing a man who's been beaten down constantly whilst also struggling to deal with a condition he can't control, but it also shows a man who casually carries a gun around, shoots Murray on live television, and finds murdering his own mother to just be part of the ""comedy"" that is his life. Speaking of his mother, I love the indication that she might have slept with Thomas Wayne and the Joker could be Batman's half-brother. It's never outright confirmed in the movie and it's entirely possible that it's just one of Joker's delusions but that's a take on their relationship I've never seen or even heard of before.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro turns on the charm as Murray Franklin and, of course, Joker sees right through him at the end of the film. When Murray comes to Arthur's dressing room and Arthur asks him to call him Joker because he had called him that in the past, Murray genuinely didn't remember the fact that he's made fun of him. Robert plays a shallow celebrity in this movie who knows how to play to a crowd but when you get right down to it, he doesn't give a damn about the pain and difficulty that other people are going through. I imagine a fair few people in Hollywood, possibly including Robert De Niro himself, are seeing themselves in his performance and it freaks them out because it forces them to face the fact that all the fame and glamour doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Most celebrities won't go out on a limb to help the less fortunate and this can make people resent them, which results in Murray getting a bullet in his brain.<br/><br/>The media is terrified of this movie. You know why? Because it's forcing them to see how ugly most of them are and how they can contribute to the rise of people like Joker. Murray represents all the self-absorbed, virtue signalling celebrities who pretend to care about the less fortunate but ultimately just want to make themselves look good. Celebrities who use their wealth to help people do exist - Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are notable examples and they did it secretly for years before the media found out - but most of them are all talk and this pisses people off. While most aren't crazy enough to shoot their heroes in the head, people who are treated as inferior by celebrities will inevitably build up some resentment. Todd Philips and Joaquin Phoenix had the balls to look Hollywood and the media in the eye and suggest that they might be just as monstrous as The Clown Prince of Crime. "
3496," The Anti-Superhero
"," An incredible performance by Joaquin Pheonix who expertly brings to life a character that was very difficult to like yet is compelling to watch.<br/><br/>The story nicely flows through the key events in the Joker's life that drive his insanity and make him question his place in a dystopian world. We feel pity for him, we feel the injustice and we squirm knowing there will be a consequence to his anger.<br/><br/>While the film neatly introduces the threads to the Batman story it can also stand alone as a story of human suffering. It's a tough story but the characters and narrative make it very enjoyable film to watch. It is the anti-superhero film without gadgets and without gimmicks. "

This movie is LOUD. This movie scares the easily frightened. But it shows that DC is capable of creating a better Joker and a better story, as well. Joker is a well written movie without reducing the acting of Joaquin Phoenix. This movie's lead made me go from saying: ""who is Joaquin Phoenix???"" to ""oh boy, it's Joaquin Phoenix.

The movie starts out slowly. Very slowly. At one point I was wondering how long it would go on at such a slow pace. However, pieces are being carefully placed, seemingly unrelated, but definitely not at random.
Then the bomb maker has all the pieces he needs.
The explosion is unexpected and violent, a tipping point that triggers all the pent-up madness and fury. The slow burn start served to immerse us in this world so we can be engulfed and swept along by the flood. Events spiral out of control as the pieces slam into place. Reality and illusion blur. Themes of family, friends, mental illness, loss, deceit, and ultimately society's failure, crash together in an increasingly shocking ride.
There's nothing happy about this movie. It is dark, through and through. I rarely do this, but I'm going again tomorrow... "

Instead it is ying/yang where within the ying you have the yang, and vice versa. It is fifty shades of grey, it is shadow under light, and darkness under the shadow. Some humans have all reasons to become mad given what they have to go through in life... "
3513," Masterpiece
"," Everyone should watch this movie, I would describe it with only one word and that is masterpiece. I'm sute Phoenix will win Oscar foe this. "
3514," A must see
"," I was in awe of Phoenix's performance, he was outstanding. This is the best film of 2019 by a country mile! "
3515," Yeezz what a movie
"," What a movie. No idea anything like that would ever come. Simply all points. I've seen so many movies lately that I knew nothing could beat the Godfather or the Dark Knight, or whatever movie is best, until I saw this movie. The acting, the story, the music, just everything. It was amazing. I think I can watch this movie a thousand times without it getting boring. THANKS FOR THIS MOVIE !!! "
3516," I could not find words
"," In conclusion, Todd Phillips's and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, a hallmark of social criticism, illustrates how a mentally injured but fundamentally well-intentioned man can be crushed completely cuz the outside world with its neglect and completely reaction-free attitude towards others. I think Phoenix offers the best performance of his life and convey the character's feelings completely, several times a viewer can also experiencing it him or herself in as long as the film lasts. Great movie, great actor. "

3519," A movie sympathetic to people with mental disorder
"," While watching 'The Dark Knight', I had felt scared. There was no method in the madness of Joker in that movie. That Joker just liked to create chaos, got a kick out of it. However, Phoenix's Joker is a disturbed, tortured human being. There are times when you feel sympathetic to him, rather, unfairly! Phoenix's Joker is also a mad character, but, he did not kill people to create chaos, he just had a lot of anger inside. This movie tells us why we should treat everyone with dignity and sympathy and not be a bully. Very few serial killer-based movies try to deal with the origin story with empathy. "
3520," Good one
"," Impressive in acting and deserves Oscar. The last scene when he says: you wouldn't get it, reminds me the movie American Beauty: ""I know you don't get it but one day you will get what I mean "
3521," A psychological movie.
"," Joaquin Phoenix acts superbly and Todd Phillips did a great job. Photography is excellent as well.<br/><br/>Nonetheless the movie never take off ..in my opinion.
I think that many viewers did not understand the real reasons behind Joker's behaviour 'cause they don't know what is NPD (narcissistic personality disorder), but this is an aspect that makes the movie really modern, courageous and very contemporary. "
3522," Blown away
", Was excited for the movie ever since the trailer came out. Did not expect to like it this much but I now love it. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is truly amazing and he deserves an Oscar. One of the best movies I have seen in a while.

"," If u are a dc fan, then you will definitely love this movie.
If you are not then you will love Joaquin phoenix "
3528," A very special movie(spoiler warning)
"," You will either love this movie or hate it, depends how you approach it and what you expect.
If you are coming to see a movie WITH the joker in it you won't get what you want.
This movie is a movie about the joker and it is very character centric.
It also has a very special take on how a bad guy becomes a bad guy.
The movie doesn't show how Arthur fleck descended to insanity, but rather how he as an insane person changes from a fairly harmless pensive person, to a chaotic murderous psychopath.
The movie doesn't make you sympathize with him and it doesn't justify the joker in anyway quite the opposite- the movie ends with you truly understanding the wicked drivers behind what he does.
The movie makes sense of the jokers actions while still keeping the audience aware of the evil and cruelty in what joker does.<br/><br/>I think this movie shows a unique perspective on Insanity not showing it as a fluid personality trait but as a definite existing issue that has repercussions on the person and how he thinks.<br/><br/>In the end, if you approach the movie with the right mindset(a character study as opposed to a story), I think you will very much enjoy it. "
3529," WOW! A Work of ART!!!!
"," This is an amazing film and a true work of art. It's always
a great day when Big Budget Hollywood lets a good director
show his stuff with such a Wonderful story and Great production all around.
A Must See Film!!! "
3530," Fantastic film that's no fun to watch
"," Pheonix's performance is phenominal and easily one of his best. The slow build of the film is what makes the final payoff all the better. It's a slow burn witnessing a mentally unstable person degrade into a psychopath. It's very uncomfortable to watch but you cant look away, I found my heart racing in the last third of the film and felt physically uncomfortable which is extremely rare for me to experience from a movie.<br/><br/>People complaining about the pacing of the overall story need to realize that this is a character study. The story itself does not matter, the focus is entirely on Arthur and only Arthur. None of the characters really matter. That's the entire point of the film. It starts slow to get you into the mind of Arthur and to get to know him before his degradation into madness, which makes his descent all the more heartbreaking. You have the morally grey area in the middle where he kills the wallstreet kids but takes it a step too far by chasing down the third guy and gunning him down. From there you start to lose the Arthur you felt bad for and are inching ever so closer to the Joker.<br/><br/>You grow to like Arthur and feel bad for him but by the end you start to despise what hes become, even though it's all the external factors throughout his life that pushed him to that point.<br/><br/>Every movie no matter how brilliant has its flaws, but from what I've seen, most peoples gripes are very minor complaints that really dont take away from the film or i guess went in expecting something different from the movie.
Easily the best movie I've seen in the past 5-10 years and a huge payoff for DC taking the risk. "
3531," Outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix
", You really feel this character. Anyone who has ever been picked on or feels the world is against them will relate more. The message should be clear on how some people don't realize how badly they treat others. We live in a world where sometimes people are so wrapped up in themselves they don't care about another human being's feelings. For me I found myself on the Joker's side. I felt pain for his pain. He has just been kicked down over and over again. He feels that life is just nasty and short and nobody cares?! The human race is bad. Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job of conveying that vulnerability and rage. With the mood swings and crazy laugh it's hard to imagine that you want him to be the hero not a villain. In his mind he is the hero ridding the world of cruel people. There have been several very different portrayals of the Joker in other movies but by far Joaquin Phoenix is in a class of his own. A dark character that you feel sympathy and empathy for. He's aware a monster is evolving inside of him and he struggles with it before releasing it. Overall this is a solid movie with a lot of darkness and depth and Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves an award for the best performance I have seen in a very long time. 
3532," More than i expected
"," Not only is excellent Phoenix's performance, director of photografy's performance was excellent too. Only when you start to appreciate how colors in every scene create the whole atmosphere and force you to get in and stay watching, do you realize how perfect mach the soundtrack does making you feel like something is close to happen every moment.
In the other hand for all comics lovers hardly did every single Phoenix body movement remember you something different than the classic unpredictable Joker even his well accomplished laughter.
In my personal opinion Not only does the movie have wonderfull and exciting scenes out of the main tory -taking as a example the Bruce Wayne parents death-, it also have perfect empathic scenes like the bloody smile at the movie end that make you understand Joker final state of mind. "
3533," Great movie
"," For those who remember the TV series and Cesar Romero's Joker, Joaquin Phoenix captures that characterization. The laugh was perfect. "
3534," Great Movie
"," In this movie, the viewer sees Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck transform from a troubled, mentally-ill clown into a mass murderer using the persona of the Joker. The viewer is left puzzled at the end of the movie from the sinister, confusing confrontation with the Joker and a social worker at the Arkham State Hospital when Arthur flees the room dancing whilst leaving a trail of blood behind. This leaves the viewer to decipher which parts of the movie were imagined by Arthur and what were reality. "

3542," All I have are positive reviews
"," Just got back from seeing it 4 hours ago and it was as great as I thought it was gonna be, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fantastic (everyone else is great too but Joaquin commands the entire thing), the score and soundtrack were fantastic, and even the cinematography is great (this was a grimier, dirtier, and uglier Gotham City than what we're used to). it can easily pass as a scorsese flick since his fingerprints were left after leaving the producer's chair. I'm torn between which joker I like best between ledger and Phoenix, but I know that heath ledger would be very proud of Joaquin for pulling it off, give him ALL the oscars I say, he's earned them. but anyway, I recommend this to scorsese fans and joker fans alike. I definitely wanna see it again, maybe even buy the blu-ray "
3543," The most different comic movie.
"," It's a bold movie but disturbing. The fact that all the fans wanna see this movie again and again . It's dark , not like Batman v/s superman , but on another level. The story of how Arthur becomes crown prince of crime.All fans wanna see the story behind a villian's action and JOKER describes it truly. "
3544," Extremely well crafted movie
"," U will be obligated to think to much after the movie which is dc all about, it rises above all the monotonous comic book movies.
Really one of a kind. "
3545," Spellbinding.

3546," My favorite movie in a while
", This is amazing... Nothing's ever black or white. A shade of grey is what this movie is about. Nothing but the best movie that's come out in a while. Its not a superhero or supervillain movie. Acting and the pain were completely believable. 
3547," See you at the Academy Awards
"," Frankly, I was't expecting a great deal from this movie, going into it.
I figured it would be another, pretty good comic book movie where the popcorn quality would be on par with the movie.
Wrong!
Joaquin Phoenix' portraya of a struggling, depressed citizen descending into madness is as good as it gets.
This caliber of performance is rare.
Do not miss it!
Well done, Mr. Phoenix.
You have amazed me :) "

3558," Joker is a mindblowing film with a great cast and great plot.
"," Joker uses every element of emotion in the movie. Joaquin Phoneix did perfect portraying the Clown Prince Of Crime. When he is trying to crying he shocking mixes both laughter and crying in one action showing us how crazy the Joker is, and the way the movie breaks hearts of people watching the film when he has these illusions that we see as normal, then suddenly when the movie is showing what happens gets people on the edge of the seat. This move is a great idea the actor took on how the Joker is mentally Ill. And to show that he is ill Joaquin Phoniex even lost 52 pounds for the role. This is why I rate this 10/10. This movie is a lot better than Avenger: Endgame on a whole new level of genius. "
3559," Best movie of 2019
"," Im speechless this movie is breathtaking, visually stunning, and perfectly evil the best movie I saw for a very long time. It even makes The Dark Knight better and it turns It 2 into a joke. Madness or Reality, Capitalism, Misfits, Illness, Rich and Poor or Anarchy this movie is perfect "

3562," POPCORN EMPIRE: Joker - Movie Review
"," ""(Joker is) a masterpiece, and easily one of the best films of the year."" 10/10<br/><br/>Joker is a DC comics film adaptation co-written and directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy) and starring Joaquin Phoenix (Her, Gladiator). The film tells the story of a mentally ill man named Arthur Fleck as he transforms into Batman's most iconic villain, the Joker.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Joker borrows some of the main elements from previous versions of the character, such as him starting out as a stand-up comedian and generally being a social outcast. But the film does away with the vat of acid and instead aims for a more grounded, gradual transformation from a damaged man to the Clown Prince of Crime. For those who might worry that revealing the Joker's origins might undermine the character, ridding him of his mysterious nature, rest assured that this film does the Joker justice and then some.<br/><br/>The film focuses almost exclusively on Arthur Fleck. He's in nearly every frame of the movie. Arthur suffers from a number of mental illnesses (they are never specified, but it is mentioned that he takes 7 different medications). Living with his mother, and working a low-income job as a clown-for-hire, Arthur feels lonely, neglected, and unseen. He gets hit with one turn of bad luck after another, from losing his job to having funding cut for his therapy and medication. Things begin to take a turn when he is attacked on a subway by three Wayne Enterprise employees. Using a gun given to him by a co-worker, he guns down the three men in self-defense (albeit a bit excessively). Things quickly spiral out of control, and Arthur soon becomes the anonymous symbol of an anarchic revolution in Gotham.<br/><br/>It can't be stressed enough how incredible Joaquin Phoenix's performance is as Arthur Fleck. He transforms himself both physically and mentally, disappearing into the character. Arthur is an unsettling, strange, and broken man, and Phoenix embodies the character perfectly, elevating the material.<br/><br/>The film offers plenty of other cinematic delights as well, from its gorgeous, moody photography to its haunting score. One highlight is the ""bathroom dance"", with a chorus of strings hitting mostly on a small handful of notes, creating a tense yet oddly beautiful melody.<br/><br/>The film has a relentless, bleak tone, but the uniqueness of Arthur's character carries you through the story and keeps you locked in your seat. You can't help but be fascinated with this character, wondering where the story will go next. While the movie does use some familiar tropes (guy down on his luck, losing his job, getting attacked in the street) they're well executed and don't feel derivative. A subplot concerning Arthur's mother and the Wayne family also adds some unexpected complexity and weight to Arthur's character development.<br/><br/>Joker is a haunting yet beautiful character study, crafted with ingenuity and an admirable attention to detail. Paying homage to inspirations such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Killing Joke"" graphic novel, Joker still manages to stand on its own. It's a masterpiece, and easily one of the best films of the year. It's not only the best DC film, but it's also a fantastic, character driven crime drama all its own.<br/><br/>10/10 "
3563," Profound!
"," I did not expect this to be so amazing. So current. Who knew that Joaquin Phoenix has this type of performance in him? Great social commentary, Amazing casting, editing, cinematography, writing etc. If I left anything out just know that a 10 review from me is almost unheard of.<br/><br/>If you are expecting to see something comic bookey....this isn't for you. This isn't for children. This is for people who grew up with the joker and remember the TV Batman saying the Joker was insane. Beautifully done Hollywood about friggen time something of the magnitude was produced. "
3564," Insanely good
"," This movie is about so many things. It's about a man and his struggle with mental illness and loneliness and his attempts to make it in this life, to so something he likes and to be happy. But it's also about brutal capitalism and corrupt politics. And as an extra, it sheds a whole different light on Batman and the Gotham scene. Though this movie doesn't retcon anything, it forces you to requestion a lot of things. Even the events of the film itself. "
3565," Society's underdog

3568," The masterpiece of 2019
"," Joker is a magnificient masterpiece, and I want to start this review by congratulate every single person that made it possible.<br/><br/>The scenes were great, the cut-offs were extremely well executed, the music was increrebly well fitted to the scenes and the acting was flawless. Even the scenes with less action were captivating and full of tension, so much that I went to see this movie in the evening, and even so i did not felt tired or full of sleep.<br/><br/>Joaquin has made what some thought Impossible: to build such a complicated character in such an amazing way, on what it seemed with no effort at all.<br/><br/>The hype is real and I strongly advice everyone to go watch this movie. "
3569," Mental illness is serious
"," It depicted mental illness very well, how this problem could be catastrophic "
3570," This is the kind of movies I want to see...
"," It's undoubtedly a transgressive, relevant and ambitious film that opens a door for comic characters to begin to star in films that are not necessarily action, and that deal with more complex and adult themes that the sober fight between good and evil. For an audience and a society that are no longer so clear about the line between what is right and wrong, and who are so willing to side with the villain, this is a cathartic, hard and difficult film, even because of the tension, the embarrassment of others and the sorrow that its protagonist causes.<br/><br/>'Joker' does not aspire to please everyone, but aims to address social issues and invite reflection. Faced with a Marvel that clings to its family entertainment formula, as infallible as it is safe, DC has accepted that it cannot do the same and has set out to address the most forgotten audience in theaters, the adult. "
3571," Dark, surreal and chillingly beautiful. Phoenix was truly brilliant
"," Absolutely brilliant! I loved it. Fleck's slow descent into insanity was beautifully tortuous. The brutality of society and the harsh realism of big corporations are the advocates and cause of his demise. The music throughout was atmospheric, haunting, and at times utterly surreal. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar for his performance and portrayal. He clearly put so much effort into the role as can be seen from his characters physical appearance. The movie was fantastically gritty, dark and poignant, It brings new meaning to the term, ""That's Life!"" "
3572," Finally a tribute to the craziest, happiest, biggest Villian of DC.
"," As expected the film was a masterpiece with a very dark tone. What makes this movie super awesome is Arthur's delusions, actually it is more difficult to get what really happened. Everything that makes him happy seems to be an illusion, so we do not know he was really saved in the ending or he reached asylum that very night.
But it is a pure reality that all murders were real. So yes he is The Joker or he is the role model of the real Joker. The most interesting part was the connection of Thomas and his wife's murder with Arthur's story.
I enjoyed the movie with twists and turns and jokes. "
3573," Phenomenal performance by Joaquin Phoenix
"," I don't write film reviews but my experience watching 'Joker' compelled me to share how profound I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was.
For the record, I hate comic book/superhero films. I am drawn to character based, mostly independent studio film making. This film is a heart wrenching depiction of mental illness and society's intolerance of it. Every second Joaquin's complex depiction of this character is flawless. In fact, I will boldly say it's the best acting I have every witnessed. Second to Joaquin's performance is the brilliant composer's score throughout this film. Both deserve every award and critics' praise. "
3574," A Bad Joke
"," It's a bad joke. It's the way the Joker sees the world in our face for the first time at the big screen. You better not believe in everything you see, but take whatever you want to.
He is no victim, when he hurts other people that find themselves in a similar situation as him, he stops being a victim. "
3575," SPEECHLESS
", Absolutely amazing. A few minor flaws but this movie was absolutely perfect! 
3576," Oscar winning performance
", Jauquin phonix is a great actor the story is very interesting and he deserves an oscar for his brilliant acting 
3577," A Villain that outshines any superhero ever born.
"," This is not a mere movie but a psychological study of human behavior. I never ever felt the emotional scenes in big movie but this masterpiece got me. This guy Mr. Joaquin is not even acting but entirely living in each frame. Every scene connects so well that as a viewer we are unable to detach and believe that its just a movie. I don't even know if any movie or character had such an impact on us as Joker did.
Though he wants the whole ""World"" to call him a Joker its actually the other way around.
'JOKER GROWS ON YOU' "
3578," My first review. Had to as it was so good.

"," The reason I'm giving it such a high rating is because of the score and the acting. Both were absolutely amazing. However, this movie does not need to have to be a comic book related movie. There was good build up to a satisfying third act but the overall movie was mediocre. Feel like this movie was made for normies that are trying to relate this movie to actual society lmao. Worth the money but this is not a 9.0 movie. "

Joaquin is such an amazing actor that you actually feel so emotional about Arthur. Such a sad, dark but beautiful film.
Anyone that knows me, knows that this is my kind of film.
I loved it so much that I'm going to see it again in a couple of days.
Perfect film. "
3586," Best movie I've seen in a while
"," Joker was a perfect set up for what really comes to be the joker IMO. Honestly I was wondering if it was gonna be the best or worst movie because of the potential of it going both ways. But it turned out perfectly, and simultaneously illustrated the real struggle and possible outcomes of mixing mental illness with the current society that exists. Well done. "
3587," Matches Heath in excellence
"," So complex such a amazing experience, not a movie for the faint heart though very depressing throughout "
3588," A movie book experience
"," This movie is like reading a book. Every scene has details of a psycopath's complicated emotions that are naturally perceived differently from one person to the other. This is exactly why it is a unique experience just like reading a book. This movie is not entertaining and it wasn't made to entertain people. I believe it was made for people to watch and think about it and live with it's emotions for a while. It is an unequal experience for different viewers. Those who see it as a marvel have understood why the movie was made in the first place and the messages drawn from it. Those not, have definitely missed the whole point. It is not a comic book movie for sure and the viewer needs to understand this before watching it. "
3589," The unbeatable was matched (heath ledger)
"," What you would not expect from a film about the most iconic villain of all time is the fact that you will feel absolutely awful for this man. I keep thinking about it as if it were real just because of how realistically Joaquin Phoenix portrays a mentally ill man that has had an awful life. This shows a whole new side to the joker and makes it possible to side with him and makes an unbiased approach to the upcoming rivalry between batman and him. Now I need to talk about the absolutely absurd ratings from ""certified"" critics. These absolute morons are saying that this film deals with mental health in an inappropriate way and as someone who has suffered with mental health problems for many years I say you couldn't be further from the truth and I'm going to put out there that this is the best depiction you will get of mental health on screen ever. My favourite scene was either the one where he is watching the stand up comedy and laughing at all the wrong points, or where he finds out that he is adopted and was abused as a child and is forced to showcase his sadness through laughter. Those scenes were some of the saddest things I have witnessed on screen just because of how much you could see the pain in his face and his real struggle not to laugh was absolutely haunting. This film has absolutely no superhero elements whatsoever and is not action-packed and it requires a much more mature viewing than any other comic book movie. This is a straight up 10/10 and I recommend it to anyone "
3590," Absolutely amazingüòç
"," In love with this movie. I thought no one could ever live up to Heath Ledgers part in the dark knight. But Wow. Phoenix could possibly be my new next favourite actor and most certainly deserves an award for this role. Movie deserves a 10/10 for screenplay, acting and story. Taking us through a dark and dull adventure of Arthur's life. U kind of feel sorry for the guy though... How he turns into the villain over a period of time is madness. Anyway, I would 100percent recommend this movie to everyone. Definitely a must see in my opinion. "
3591," WELL NO ONE'S LAUGHING NOW ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH.....
", Well! after all the controversy i must say this is a powerful story about mental heath that must be told and has been told in the most amazing way and hats off to jaoquin phoenix the acting is EMPHATIC! infact i never thought i say this but he has done it BETTER than heath ledger in the dark knight YES i just said that with no regrets.... and the picture is amazing the story is thought provoking... the cinematography is purely stunning 
3592," Joker
", I just watched joker and IT WAS SIIIICK (METALMETALMETAL) The scene where he's talking to Robert Dinero is trippy AND SCARY the movie is so great and there's more than one part in it that is just beautiful depiction. If you haven't seen it or haven't heard much about it I would recommend seeing it before you have heard much and seeing in theatre I'm glad I did. WOW THAT WAS A GREAT MOVIE. 
3593," Absolute Masterpiece
", Loved the Origin Story for the Joker. Seen it in the cinema and will be seeing it again before it leaves the cinema. Joaquin Phoenix gives a jaw dropping performance as Joker. 
3594," A Superhero Movie as a Character Study
"," A movie headlined by the incredible, once in a lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix portraying the Clown Prince of Crime. Phoenix's performance is one for the ages! It is emotional, twisted, fearless, strange and stunning and is on par with the legendary performance of Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight. Furthermore, ""Joker"" is exceptionally directed with a unique style never before seen in superhero movie. It's visuals are beautiful, the shots are unique and the editing flawless. Definitely one of the best movies of 2019! "
3595," Finally A Movie Without Bad Jokes
",
3596," Todd Philipps is no Scorsese
"," I loved the subversion of the Joker and would recommend it to everyone.
BUT I was bored by some easy scenes (especially the opening one) and Todd Philipps doing some Todd Philipps stuff:
(overuse of) slow motions, stylish shots, stylish effects, big music...
Too much.
Take Taxi Driver. Same idea. Less effects. More impact? I believe so. After all, it's a lifetime classic.
Will Joker be? I don't believe so.
Joker definitely is subversive, but in a mainstream way. "
3597," A master piece. Superb Phoenix!
"," A masterpiece in itself, about madness, revenge, rejection, misuse of power and opinion. Masterful direction, superb acting, my respects for the best film in years ... independent of being a great story about villains and the great victim and its origin. "
3598," Masterpiece, in the level of Dark Knight saga,
"," This decade has so many super heroe trash movies like avengers endgame, that we really needed a good film to fill the empty hole the dark knight saga had left... Finally it arrived, and it's THE JOKER, a magnetic drama film that turns into a psychotic political thriller with rough critics to the capital power and richness, and the birth of the biggest and most charismatic anti hero ever seen, SUBLIME! not less than 10/10. "
3599," This film makes feel feelings
"," It's really hard to say something about good films, so when I went out of cinema four days ago I hadn't any words to describe anything about Joker movie. And I still under reflection.<br/><br/>Everything is just brilliant in that movie: story, actors, picture and costumes.<br/><br/>I expected ""not-Marvel-style"" movie, but I wasn't ready for that level of dramatic and tradegy. I know that Joker did terrible things with people, but all I wanted is just grab him and hide from this people. This movie just shows true side of real society and knowing that makes me feel really terrible. "
3600," good but overrated
"," It is a good movie with some caveats, I think they overestimated the movie by saying that it is intimate, given that the character flies before 1 hour on screen and there are not many scenes that make this construction, besides the several script flaws to the address a serious topic. Joaquim's performance is the great protagonist. "
3601," You Get What You Deserve
", Society can't treat us gamers this way any longer. Gamers are the most oppressed group in history and it shows. Joker is a modern masterpiece. Nicker Nation rise up 
3602," A master art piece which will stay with you
"," The film is so relevent to today's times and the times to come, it will go on in your head even after hours and days together, the intricate details of Joaquin Phoenix's body language and the vision to the tonality of Todd Philips to very frame emerses you into Arthur Fleck's world. i am proud to say that i am a fan of the Joker character after 11 years of waiting. "
3603," A dark masterpiece!!!
"," This movie is one of the best movies of recent times in all aspects!Acting,screenplay,direction and everything this movie offers!Joaquin Phoenix has shown his acting prowess fully in this movie.He truly lived the character in the movie and that is showing his dedication to this movie.Comparing him and Heath ledger is an insult to both of their hard work and dedication they gave to their respectful movies.Do not go to watch this movie expecting CGI fighting scenes or anything you generally see in movies of DC/Marvel.Do not listen to some people saying that this movie can affect your behaviour! I think most of you are smart enough to understand difference between a movie and real life.Thank you everyone associated to this movie for this real and mesmerizing movie after a long time!! "
3604," The most important review.
"," No need to compare Jokers. Phoenix did a great job as well as others have. What I loved most about this movie. Was how it wasn't even needed to be in a DC world. This story was very deep and realistic. In that time period definition possible to happen. I wouldn't say this movie was perfect. But it's great in many ways. Nothing was over done. Besides maybe the laughing a little bit. Would fully recommend seeing in theaters if given the chance. Out of 22 movies I've seen in theaters this year, Jokers been the best so far. "
3605," Best movie ever.
", I dont think 10* is enaf for this movie. Deserves more. 
3606," A masterpiece
", Joaquin phoenix has nailed it! You can watch it a million times! 
3607," Perfection
", Insanely provocative! Beautiful acting by Mr. Phoenix. 
3608," A new standard for the superhero genre
"," After the disappointment of Jared Leto's take on the joker i was not sure whether this version would live up to heath ledger's amazing performance, then people started hyping up this film but i still wasn't sure until i watch it. Going in to the movie i had my expectations low, but as i was watching the film i fell in love with every thing about the movie. This is truely a masterpiece in filmmaking. Instead of the CGI wonder fest of most superhero movies these day joker in grounded, its more of a character study of Arthur fleck and how a man can turn into The Joker. This film has shown that superhero films can be more than just CGI wonder fest of the marvel movies. "
3609," AMAZING FILM! PURE CINEMA, GIVE JOAQUIN THE OSCAR!
"," Joker is by far a perfect cinematic achievement for the DCEU One of Joaquin's absolute best performance He brings such raw and a new portrayal to the joker that we haven't seen before the realism, relation to society and raw dark tone is what makes it different to the previous portrayals! Phillips absolutely nails the direction in this film no question about it a huge change in comparison from his previous films. Phillips tells us a beautiful story captured in such a damaged society that is written extremely well. The cinematography was visually impressive there are moments in which there is no dialogue and the shot gives you such an unsettling dark feeling which is what the intentions are. The score is so simple yet extremely haunting that continuously plays throughout the film with such perfection. The birth of joker is perfectly written and an amazing transition where it gives you an understanding of Arthur before his journey into madness and everything that leads to that. A must watch if you enjoy pure art!! "
3610," Desolation and Revenge Fuel Joker
", It took two viewings to gather this movie all in. It wasn't until the second time that the tragedy sunk in. Todd Phillip's interpretation of the greatest villain in comic history will haunt you for days after you've watched it. Joaquin Phoenix delves into the abyss to bring you a version of the Joker that is both sad and terrifyingly isolated within the dark forces of his own mind and environment. Everything is a delusion within a reality within a nightmare. Your heart aches to hear him laugh at offbeat moments and at his childlike belief being shattered into madness. Joker in my opinion falls right behind Dark Knight as the best the comic book genre has to offer in movies. 
3611," Most satisfying Movie of recent times !!!
"," What an amazing movie it was and showed how actors can create magic even with low budgets and without VFX and stuff.
Jouquin was amazing, give him all the awards now!
Also the real joker's are the media houses who are becoming more and more irrelevant... "
3612," Just what DC needed.
"," This is exactly what I have been waiting for. Uncomfortable throughout the whole movie, dark, and insane. Best ""super hero"" movie if you can even still call it that. "
3613," Main difference Between The Joker 2008 & 2019
", Joker 2019 is a deep thriller philosophical movie about the mind of the Joker... movie of the decade I say.<br/><br/>But here's the thing...<br/><br/><ul><li>The Dark Knight Rises could enjoy it over and over.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Joker is brilliant and real.

3619," The easiest 10 ever.
", The performance of Joaquin Phoenix would have been enough to warrant a 10 on it's own but the story and very much 'supporting' actors back it up 100%. His performance as his characters persona changes is truly immense. The more I think about his performance the better i realise it is.

What is funny to one is not funny to another(quote).
Now the only reason I didn't give a ten is because of the Gary Glitter soundtrack who incidentally will make a small fortune from this.
Gary Glitter I hear some of you mutter?......do your homework.
But that aside this is a must see! "

"," Excellent photography, soundtrack, atmosphere, actors, simple and easy to digest but without falling into treating its viewers as idiots. "
3624," What a Masterpiece
"," Great acting performance and directing. i loved Heath Ledger i never though there would be a single performer who could substitute him in flesh as a Joker no offense to the former Jokers prior to Heath Ledger. learning from Suicide squad's joker to replicate him would make the character terrible, but phoenix's performance was amazing.Now i can let go of the soul of Heath Ledger finally, RIP.

3627," Speechless
"," A masterpiece, it's so beautiful and also uncomfortable, Joaquin Phoenix should look where to put his Oscar "
3628," An unforgettable masterpiece.
"," The ultimate depiction of society as it is today. The laughter - metaphor for keeping an upbeat facade despite one's world crumbling. The underlying dynamics of rich Vs poor..and ultimately, how loneliness and lack of belonging manifested itself as a form or ment health.<br/><br/>Beautiful, depressing and unforgettable. "
3629," My first 10
"," Don't know where to start. I'll keep it brief.<br/><br/>This is a magnificent film in all respects and it's the first film to truly give the thought, effort and performance that a comic book character as deep as the Joker requires. In fact it transcends the lore and has left us with something completely unique, wonderful and thought provoking. "
3630," Unbelievable Movie...
"," This is one of the best movies ever made period..dark, depressing,violent,funny you will feel every emotion while watching this &amp; the score is mesmerising,please go see it or you will regret it honestly...2020 Oscars are already sewn up. "

3636," Masterpiece
"," I like how Joaquin Phoenix gonna win the oscars, his performance was incredible. His laugh awhile his nerves and crying was unbelievable, his character at the beginning when he's struggling with his condition, day by day he realized that people getting noticed, this man is the solution for that community. Between the rich and poor.<br/><br/>Overall I think he did a wonderful job. I definitely want to see him the next Batman movie, then i can say if he's better then Heath Ledger or not. "
3637," Yes it's that good
"," Uncomfortable, unsettling, provocative, a masterpiece of a film that makes you feel every scene from start to finish. I rewatched The Dark Knight and this movie was a stand alone and unique movie experience. GO WATCH IT! "
3638," Movie of the year
"," That's all there is to it. This is the movie of the year. Go see it. Go see it on a big screen. Go see it twice. Best acting performance, perhaps I've ever seen. Joaquin got that Oscar in the bag, unless outrage culture spoil an obvious choice. This movie will change comic book/superhero/villain movies for years to come for sure. "

",
3640," One of the films of the year
"," Joker is brilliantly writed, beautifully shot and of course astonishingly performed. Eventhough its not perfect,it can easily be one of the biggest cinema events in our age. "
3641," If you wanna know what THE Joker is made of..this is your chance
"," It is kinda disappointing why some people, critics to be exact complain of this movie having extreme violence. That's the joker man! What else do you expect? First go check what hell he has unleashed on gotham earlier and then only whin about the brutality thing here. Anyways, an excellent piece of filmmaking..loved the soundtracks.. brilliant cinematography..and of course, Phoenix won hearts. Hats off, Sir! A must watch if you're human enough "
3642," Masterpiece? No, but Phoenix makes it as close as we can get
"," Gonna start off by saying that i adored Joaquin Phoenix's performance here. His acting is fantastic and the way he controls his body in such a specific and creepy fashion is just unbelievable. He CARRIES this movie, and gives Ledger a legitimate run for his money. I wish I took more specific notes during the film, so I'll keep this short and sweet. The plot is pretty solid, the acting is Oscar worthy and the directing is pretty damn good. The way Phillips directs makes us feel like we are in a Gotham city where crime goes mainly unnoticed. So he does a good job there and in a lot of other aspects as well, but it just borrowed a bit too much from Dark Knight. If Phillips didn't have Nolan's trilogy to work off of, he would've been completely screwed. While Joaquin's performance was absolutely amazing and worth the ticket price alone, he's not the same smart joker that we are used to seeing. A lot of his plan just seems to come to him last moment, he is very short sighted and almost lucky, where as the DK's Joker is always one step ahead. There were no schemes and no tactical genius. Ledger benefited significantly from having Nolan as his writer and director; Phoenix clearly didn't have the same circumstance. While his performance is amazing, Joker just doesn't have the same intelligence that the Dark Knight's Joker has. All of it just seems to kind of fall into his lap and Phillips gives us this weird anti hero dichotomy. Great movie, but without Joaquin it could have been much, much worse.. "
3643," A masterpiece of a movie
", Joker is the perfect adaptation of a comic with the boys and Joaquin Phoenix should get an oscar finally a good movie after all that mcu trash 
3644," Smile and cry
"," Our society behaviour. When you cry people don't understend. If you smile, you get a beat. Why do you feel anything? :) ;( "
3645," Taxi Driver 2019
"," Reminded me a lot of Taxi Driver, and what do you know, Robert De Niro has a role in this film. Physiological thriller that makes you root for the protagonist throughout and you feel his emotions, One of the best films I've seen in quite some time. "
3646," A controversial masterpiece
"," Literally the best movie I've seen in my whole life, right next to The Godfather part I and II. For someone that knows the backstory behind all the Batman related universe, I think this is a total masterpiece, and from my point of view, the critics that rate this movie low, either don't know about the references and backstory of the movie itself or are themselves trying to sink it with their bad reviews, for they don't agree with the things that the movie criticizes about our society, which is crudely portrayed as it is. "
3647," One of the most important films made yet.
",
3648," And the Oscar goes to.....
", Best performance by an actor I have ever witnessed. I have never been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix. I have no doubt he will win the Academy Award for best actor. Amazing masterpiece of a movie. 
3649," Do not mistake this movie for a regular comic book iteration.
"," With all due respect to Heath Ledger, May he rest in peace, his Joker never really made sense to me. Atleast for me, nothing made me have any sort of positive emotional connection with him, which is exactly what the whole point of Joker is.<br/><br/>But Joaquin Phoenix's Joker makes you sympathize for him. It makes you want to just help him out of the dark, gritty world he lives in. It even almost makes you think that maybe he deserves to do what he's doing. That, combined with his immense acting skills, brought out a Joker which to me is rivaled by none. His creepy laugh and disturbingly thin bodyframe, combined with his weird behavior, just perfect. As for the movies, absolutely no flaws for me. No plot holes, no nothing. The background score was amazing and really rises up the tension level. Extremely well made movie, which could very possibly turn out to be the best movie of 2019. "
3650," The joker
"," There was nicholson, there was ledger and there is Joaquin.
Arguably best performance by any actor period. "
3651," very fckn awesome
", Idk this movie allows me to be able to see openly about social inequalities that are very clear and real... 
3652," Astounding movie
"," People tend to compare the movie with Nolans thrilogy, comic books and graphic novels, but that's unjustified because it doesn't follow a comic book morphology. On the contrary, this film shows us a reflection of the real world while using an existing character (the Joker). Joker leads us in to a social/psychological drama that leaves a bitter taste. Joaqin delivered the role tremendously and showed us the origin of Joker. The entire movie can be interpreted as an allegory of the decaying ideology or economical and political problems around the world especially when it comes to the struggling lower and middle classes. Furthemore, it tells about the importance of mental health awarness and the consequences of not getting help when needed. The story is very well constructed and it slowly builds tension. I must sallute the amazing frames, colours, music and atmosphere. That's how you do it! "
3653," Glorious

"," Just come out of cinema after watching joker and don't know how I feel, certainly need to go home and watch a cartoon or something as it was so disturbing and gritty... definitely not one for the kids.
However Joaquin Phoenix acting was amazing and he sooooooo certainly deserves an award for this, cant imagine a better actor for this movie. "
3657," Positive review
"," Incredible. As a comic fan, it blew me away. I'm betting Phoenix will win the Oscar for his performance. Great leadup to the new Batman reboot, shows the slow decline in of Gotham and how it will eventually need a Batman to clean it up. Also, it couldn't have come at a better time, not too far off current situations "

3659," Incredibly powerful performance
", I saw this movie last night and still can't stop thinking about it. It was an incredibly powerful portrayal of one mans decent into madness with socio-political undertones. Joaquin Phoenix's perfrmance is up there with the best acting and character development ever seen on screen. Cannot fault this movie! 
3660," A really adult superhero comic adaptation.
"," A really overwhelming movie from the first minute.
An incredible psychological work of the most memorable villain of the comics that moves away from any conventional adaptation of it.
And an ending that places Joker as a symbol, as Nolan did with Batman, only in this case it is the opposite pole. "

3663," the Oscar was delivered
"," Joker is dark, horrible and disturbing, and yet one of the best of the year. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a Oscar worthy performance. With Scorsese vibes, an amazing soundtrack and a incredible picture, Todd Phillips recreated the Joker in an original way. I'm speechless about Joaquin'a role. Completely incredible, brilliant, horrifying film that can serve as image for the society of today. "
3664," Experience the brilliance!
"," Stepped into the cinema with half expecting it to be a regular Hollywood crime thriller with joker as being the central character. But I assure you this movie has created some magnificent work in laying out the story and setting the stage for the grand entry of a very different genre within the comic book realm.<br/><br/>Phoenix performance is literally scary. His expressions, his delivery. One can not simply watch the movie without feeling remorse for Arthur. He has portrayed the character beautifully. It's his story, he is the center of the world, and the rest of the world is completely oblivious of this fact.<br/><br/>At times the situation seems forced and his reaction appears to be greater than you would expect in such scenario. But I believe that's the beauty of it. Being unpredictable about what's coming next in Arthur's journey.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips has done an exemplary work. This movie is a work of art. Lawrence Sher has created a cinematic experience one would find in a Nolan movie. Cinematography is gorgeous and quite reminiscent of an old classics. Excellent work by the whole crew.<br/><br/>Third act of the movie is the strongest and weekest at the same time. Though we all expect things to end in a certain way, Arthur's character development needed a bit more of a solid ground before turning the protagonist to antagonist against the society itself.
Loved the way they connected it to Batman, which can be explored in some later movies.<br/><br/>In the end.. a must watch for every cinema lover out there! "
3665," A Troubled Man Becomes the Trouble

3666," Even if you don't like super heroes movies, you MUST watch Joker
"," Simply put, an amazing movie, intense, emotional, dark and with a such powerful message of discrimination that we always see around.<br/><br/>It just worth it. "
3667," The metamorphosis is complete. Wow!
"," This is a real character study of mental illness and the breakdown of society. The grimy, washed out city scapes depict a Gotham on the brink of turmoil, and this doesn't disappoint. The first half feels like you're watching a black and white flick before the second half's colourful burst. Joaquin Phoenix is superb. You feel his pain and growing insanity, and see - feel - through his eyes the blurring of his reality and fantasy following some scenes in which the audience feels the same.<br/><br/>At the same time this is a cleverly woven tale of sadness, deceit and lies. Any comparisons to Heath Ledger and The Dark Knight should be forgotten - these are two completely different movies that both serve their respective characters well.<br/><br/>However, as a stand-alone origin tale this is filmmaking at its best. The cinematography and photography gives Gotham the 'angry melting pot about to overflow' theme the treatment it deserves. The mixture of anarchy, anger, wrongdoing and politics feel strangely familiar in a society where the downtrodden are forgotten and left to fester.<br/><br/>As said, Phoenix is superb. With a great supporting cast as Robert De Niro's smarmy talk show host and Brett Cullen's arrogant and spiteful Thomas Wayne, they only add to the powerful upper echelons of society.<br/><br/>At two hours, Todd Phillips' film kept me engrossed, smiling and sad. The film's set pieces were nicely staged and the time flew by. People will be discussing this movie for a long time! cb "

", It's Amazing how out of touch some critic reviews are of this Film. Joaquin Phoenix Nails the Joker in such a way that two things seem to happen as you are watching. One you are rooting for this insane man to destroy his enemies. Two you start questioning your own sanity.

"," You do not know exactly whether his uncontrolled laughter bursts are the result of his clown snact, or belong to a serious condition. Maybe he camouflages his pain with a smile. The fact is that in the early 1980s Gotham City is a cruel, divided society where weapons are freely circulated and the mental health care system is cut down. It is a world where Arthur falls and rises like Joker, shooting and dancing in clown costume. Joaquin Phoenix will soon get the lightness of a Tai Chi practitioner and a tap dancer, floating from a concrete staircase. "

"," Well, where do I start. This movie is phenomenal and if Phoenix does not get an Oscar, I really do not know who should. I have seen numerous way worse Oscar winners and performance of this man was not only very good or convincing - it was hypnotic.<br/><br/>However, I have a one huge advice for everyone willing to see this movie - DO NOT watch is as a superhero movie (do not try to compare him to previous Jokers, do not try to follow the lore, etc.). You will be disappointed. It is an utterly different genre and experience.<br/><br/>Watch it from the point of view that every single one of us may be in Joker's place. We just need one bad (good) day. And only then this movie will reveal its brightest colors. "

"," I don't normally write reviews but, if the Oscar people read these boards I just want to say here and now that: if Joaquin isn't awarded the Oscar for this performance then ""shame on you"".

Without him even saying a word (and with his back to the screen for goodness sake) I KNEW that the transformation from Arthur to Joker was complete. Outstanding performance, simply outstanding. "

3704," Joker is Very Well Written, One of the Best Films of 2019
"," Joker is one of my favorite films of 2019. I thought this was a pretty tight script, don't have any issues with the writing of this film. While Joaquin Phoenix doesn't surpass Heath Ledger, I think he definitely made this role his own, I loved his performance, and I think he deserves an Oscar nomination. Along with Adapted Screenplay and perhaps Best Picture. This film is very much so inspired by Martin Scorsese and his films, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and it compliments those films in a loving way. I personally didn't think it was derivative of those films and I personally liked it more than The King of Comedy. All the other performances were great, the film was beautifully shot, the cinematography and shot composition were great. I loved the score, this is all around just a very well acted drama that's a very deep, psychologically disturbing, and well written character study. I cannot wait to see it again. "
3705," OMG
"," MAGNIFICENT!
I just watched it and I'm speechless...
Joaquin Phoenix is a true genius. "
3706," Joker is Joaquin plus some cinematography and set design
"," It is surprising to me that JOKER could ne taken seriously, as obvious Vemice did. It lacks focus, and even then tries too hard to include societal problems. Why even include the Wayne saga in the formation of the core psyche if our antihero. Joker has all the seeds buried within his DNA without the late 70's NYC rat problem. You don't have to search for crappy people in any society.<br/><br/>It bites off more than it need chew storywise, which ultimately diminishes any empathy we might confer for Joker despite Phoenix's performance, and it is a performance !. De Niro is there to remind us of Jo's king of Comedy, underrated it should be seen more.<br/><br/>DARK smoky photography to go with set design are also good. Otherwise just not comvincing. "

Need not superpower, electric zap nor bitten by a tarantula, simply put Joaquin portrays so well what a real person in a real world could turn in to.

Seeing him in batman the animated series(1992) or tim burtons take on the character or even reading comics that involved him made me realize not only how complex this particular character is but also how he can be written in so many different ways.
Today im 22 years old, i walked into the theatre thinking that the hype might be coming from fans missing the joker on screen, but hold on a minute, todd wrote and joaquin delivered!.
Legendary performance, great writing, moving score, great use of color pallets and a mesmerizing study/deep look on both the joker and society, thats not all, expressing to you how the joker made me feel throughout the movie is a hard thing to do, so i leave the rest to you.
Joaquin For oscars. "

"," It has been long time since we saw a movie with this depth regarding the character performance (main bomb of the movie) as performed by J. Phoenix, also the plot with all the elements (direction, music , the moments when action is at its most) all are success elements for this work.
It reminded me with the glort of the Dark Knight triology.
Joaqin Thank You ! "
3730," Has a murder ever made you laugh???
"," Every story needs a protagonist well it does and what if the the protagonist is the derranged one?? Joker is a story of an antagonist who is the protagonist. A protagonist who will make you feel sorry, make you laugh and cry if you really connect with him. He will make you live his life justify his every action from killing random bullies to his mother. A review of simple words cannot describe the movie, but if there is still anybody out there with any doubts that who is the best joker ever should go ahead and watch the movie. "
3731," The Movie the Character Deserved.
"," I am a Joker Fan from the time i saw the character in 'The Dark Knight' from that time i wanted to see him in a full fledged movie, and here it is the Movie that was fully pledged for the deadly character. This film has just provided what the Joker character required and the performance was the main light of the film. Pheonix has given a new definition to the character as what Heath Ledger gave. "

3733," One of the Greatest Performances of All Time!
"," Joker is simply a perfect movie. Todd Philip's Direction is top notch, cinematography sets a perfect dark tone which goes well with a mind blowing background music. The Story which touches sensitive topics of mental illness and depression is equally Great and so is the star cast.<br/><br/>Finally the Performance of Joaquin Phoenix - Wow! From his maniac laugh to the perfect Joker walk to simply screen presence, everything is just Great. There are no words to define his acting, this performance is right there with that of Heath Ledger's Joker, Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lector and a few others.
JOAQUIN PHOENIX HAS DELIVERED ONE OF THE GREATEST PERFORMANCES IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD CINEMA. "

"," Innocence of a man destroyed by the ""system "" in Gotham City forces him to resort to crime. Torture, stress, depression are the main elements that have been portrayed beautifully by Phoenix. The direction and cinematography was phenomenal. Hats off to Todd Philips who brought out the darkness in the whole film impressively and giving it a Retro touch. "
3735," A Visual Treat
"," The best thing about Joker is it's shot composition and it's score.
The score is so perfectly timed that it doesn't force you to feel the tension in the scene rather it feeds to the tension created visually.
The story could have been better.
The influence of 'The King of comedy' and the Portrayal of Joker by Heath Ledger can clearly be seen.

"," The story of how Joker is born from Arthur. A man who suffers severe mental conditions developed over the course of a traumatic life in a crime-ridden society ruled by the filthy rich. To say that he ""snapped"" would be a mild understatement.<br/><br/>The development of the ""Joker"" character is really well done by Joaquin Phoenix from the mental and physical attributes he portrays. The special effects are very subtle to say the least in this regard.<br/><br/>Mentally dark and sinister, peppered with dry humour is an apt description. Plus a few good tunes to boot. "
3739," ""Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune,Bird fly high by the light of the moon, Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.""
"," Along with Doctor Sleep (fingers crossed its good!) Joker has been my most anticipated film of the year,which I planned to see in IMAX on the opening day. Since the movie came out, all my plans annoyingly went haywire, first in finding it not on at IMAX due to Disney block-booking the screen for Ad Astra, then getting the flu,and breaking a tooth, causing it to have to be removed!<br/><br/>Being in town today after a meeting,I decided take the chance to push all that bad luck aside,by going to the local cinema to finally play the joker.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Going right back to the Punk spirit of his GG Allin documentary origins,co-writer/(with Scott Silver) director Todd Phillips &amp; his regular cinematographer Lawrence Sher switch on Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's excellent grinding Industrial score, and dissect Fleck with a incredibly a raw atmosphere, opening Gotham to stunningly vast wide-angle shots taking in the mountains of trash and poverty-stricken crumbling buildings, which Fleck dies in,but Joker is born from.<br/><br/>Whilst clearly inspired by 70's US cinema,Phillips wisely avoids making this a mere tribute, by stripping the film from every layer of gloss CBM have been painted with over the last few years, to instead cast light at grime-covered murky colours, spread in stylishly restrained short zoom-ins and tracking shots bringing the viewer up close to the short, sharp, shots of abrasive violence.<br/><br/>Igniting a revolution from Thomas Wayne calling people ""Clowns"", the screenplay by Phillips and Silver takes a grounded approach to the actions of Fleck, who becomes a symbol as Joker, after getting chewed and spat out by society. Book-ending the film with Fleck speaking to a counsellor, the writers draw a excellent character study laced with bitter dialogue, driving the film not with action scenes, but Fleck being grind down of his humanity until the chaos of Joker is all that remains.<br/><br/>Joined by a great,on the edge Frances Conroy as his mum, a dreamy Zazie Beetz as neighbour Dumond, and a double bill of gruffness from Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne and Robert De Niro as Murray, Joaquin Phoenix gives a astonishing, expressive turn as the battered and beaten across every step of the downward spiral Joker. "
3740," A must watch
"," Give Phoenix an Oscar already. The man is a delightful surprise.
In Greek we say ""actor means light"" that was exactly what this man did for his character, he put some ""light"" into his personality.
One of the best performance I have ever seen. "
3741," Writer's point of view: What have gone wrong and how it could have been fixed?
"," I will try my best not to make this review long, I will sum my opinion in two points.<br/><br/>I watched Joker with two mindsets, I am a Fan and I am a WRITER. The fan inside me is pleased but the writer asked for something, and would not settle with ""it was OK""<br/><br/>1- The quick escalation of events:
I understood the movie and its message very well. I congratulate the writers of this movie for making such a unique take on the joker, and I liked the sequence of the events until the final act of the film. There is a ""missing chain of events""
As a writer you need to ask yourself the following questions:
<ul><li>Why all the people in the sub-way were wearing clowns masks all of a sudden?</li><li>Why there were riots against policemen? Is it something logical you would do as a law abiding citizen that you hear about a crime on TV, and then instead of sympathizing with the victim you would hold demonstrations along with other persons you do not know and wear the exact same mask and take the same sub-way train and head towards the same destination !!!!!!!!!. Who would even sell that mask and where can someone get it at that time (70s)?</li></ul>What you need is a driving action/ a motive / a call for action/ a missing sparkle. Right ?
Here's a suggestion:
What if after Arthur had killed the three rich-boys, two policemen assaulted a random guy who dresses as a clown, (like if it is his night job or something), and we were seen scenes where it is prohibited to wear a clown mask or dress like a clown and we were shown a number of arrests in the background of a random scene where Arthur walks by and a policeman arrested a clown.
and all of a sudden the above mentioned random innocent guy who were assaulted by the police died as a result of that assault and the word has spread across all media news papers and TV and it turns out that the guy has nothing to do with the murder of the three rich-boys and as a sequence of that event People demonstrated wearing clowns, and there are clashes here and there between the security forces and the angry mob until Arthur appearance on TV as Murray thought that would be a Hit, to show a person (who works as clown) who he personally mocked and now reconciles with him and then BANG until the End of the movie and you know the rest.<br/><br/>2- The not-good overly used good elements:
The Dance was overly used. I believe if you are going to use Dancing as measurement of how a person is in control or to symbolize the state of mind of a person and how he has become the Joker of the film and it is a dance of glory and confidence, then it should have a purpose, they could have used it as if his job depends on him to perform dancing routines for children but he could not because he cannot dance, and he struggles throughout his career as a clown to be getting paid less or being ignored by his employer for that reason and now we get to understand why his fellow clowns take more advantages than him and why his boss wanted to fire him and of course not because of a stupid sign, imagine if you get mobbed and beaten in the street and then someone blames you for losing a stupid sign. This is not logical. "
3742," Affecting, dark and timely film, with superb cast; would have been perfect if ending kept short and ""bitter-sweet""
"," There's no surprise in the plot. What draws audience is the acting and timely theme of social equity and senseless crimes. The film suggested the causes and the ending seemed to portray Joker in a triumphant way - I gave the writers benefit of the doubt; that this ending was meant to show the ironic turn of Arthur from being an unwanted comedian who liked to cheer people young and old, to being accepted and even followed as a villain-vigilante. I would have given it 9~10 if the film ended in the night scene, but it dragged into more scenes inside a hospital which felt redundant to us sympathetic audience.<br/><br/>The film message to me is not about provoking civil unrest and violent rampage. I see the story as a cautionary tale about missed opportunities for society to come together especially during difficult and uncertain times. Give, not take; trust, not judge. Peace. "

3750," Todd Phillips' Unsettling Masterpiece
"," Every decade or so, the perfect movie is made, a stand-alone masterpiece unlike anything before its time. And for appreciates of true cinema everywhere, I'm beyond thrilled to report that Todd Phillips' Joker is that very film.<br/><br/>Coming from someone who hates every superhero movie made, this is saying a great deal. Phillips, who directed a few of my all-time favorites, including The Hangover Trilogy, Due Date and War Dogs, has set aside his slap-stick comedy for a far greater edge. He took the wildly inflated, hardly realistic Gotham, and transformed the city into a terrifyingly beautiful reality.<br/><br/>And apart from its fictitious DC Comics origin, this film couldn't stand further from a superhero fantasy. Instead, we're dealing with a psychological thriller showcasing the failed life and career of Arthur Fleck.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix, who in his unusual brilliance fits the role perfectly, has recreated the villain into a character all his own. Gone are the days of past jokers including Cesar Romero (1966), Jack Nicholson (1986) and cinema-legend Heath Ledger (2008). Philips's Joker is the first film in fifty years of franchise history to address the clown and clown alone, no batman in sight.<br/><br/>And rather than a God's eye view of his mental instability, viewers are hurled directly into Fleck's heart and soul. We grow attached to the traumatized child trapped in a grown man's body, the impoverished outcast longing for affection and the dead-beat seeking ultimate purpose.<br/><br/>With every day wielding a Shakespeare-grade tragedy, he inevitably reaches his breaking point. And as Fleck's prescribed antipsychotics grow scarce, his savage desires run rampant. He's been bludgeoned, degraded and mislead for the last time. He submits to the slums and, with glorious triumph, creates a legacy through chaos: ""The Joker"" is born.<br/><br/>Fair warning, this movie isn't for the faint of heart. Fleck's disturbing persona, clinically diagnosed laughing disorder and overall drear will challenge your comfort zone from start to finish. His nonstop tragedy is conveyed to such unsettling degrees, that one can't help but sympathize. And when he makes the first kill in a fleeting act of self-defense, who could blame him?<br/><br/>Initiating a downward spiral, Fleck's quench for chaos grows to immeasurable lengths. Law and order grows corrupt as the street-revolution turns vigilante. The slums picket for more violence and Fleck promptly delivers. He's psychotic and unstable, but arguably justified in his heinous crimes.<br/><br/>The Joker will make the moviegoer support a psychopath and demand societal equality for degenerates. It'll twist ones perception of higher-ups, resulting in ultimate support for the villain.<br/><br/>""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treat him like trash?"" says Arthur. A glorious film. "

"," Review: I don't usually do this but it triggered something in me. SKL. I am no expert in movies reviews<br/><br/>""Joker"" the movie was awesome! True what they about it, being dark, being morbid and being brutal. But it is suppose to be dark, morbid and brutal because this is not a hero's movie, it is a villain's movie. But with such theme, I have seen a clearer picture of the importance of the significance of mental health, the value of a society and the worth of one self.<br/><br/>If they say heroes are made, villains too are bred. It just need two of the most important ingredients - society and oneself. Arthur aka Joker has conflicts already with what surrounds him and most especially with himself. He trying to fight his demons. Trying so hard but in the end ate him all up. He was trying to reach out help from society. He wanted to be understood, accepted and loved for who he was with all his imperfections but society showed its cruelty upon him that allowed his demons get the best the him. And allowed him to fight against society itself. The movie has showed that the need to belong and to be loved has a price to pay and the payment is oneself - losing oneself in the process.<br/><br/>Society is ruthless in its own way. I know I always say, you always have a choice whether to allow society get the best of you or allow yourself to control who your are. But if this relentless environment wont stop and continue to haunt you and conditions you, i cannot blame the individual to become who he wish he'd not become. Society breeds its own demons.<br/><br/>Never underestimate the power of the mind and the power of society for it can make or break in ways you can't imagine.<br/><br/>That is why please, let us learn to accept and start understand each other. We all have predicaments in life, but people right now don't need your judgements and fanciful opinions about how to live life. What most people need right is unconditional positive regard on who they are. And may we bring back humanity in humans by doing so.<br/><br/>Take care of your peace of mind. Talk to professional like teachers, professors, counselors, psychologist, social workers, etc. But if not this kind of individual, go to persons you trust, to person that understands you and accepts you. Mental health issues are not made to be battled alone. Because we always need someone at the end of the day to help us be on our feet. So please society give these professionals what they deserve.<br/><br/>Society makes is own demons but surely it can undo it as well.<br/><br/>And lastly, love yourself despite of everything because whatever happens it will always be about you.<br/><br/>The Joker movie is dark and powerful but you have to see that behind that dark theme, has a formidable meaning. "

The dancing and the laughter is great but his voice is too childish a far cry from Matt Hamil in the animated series. The Joker got a huge following for no reason shooting 3 wall street guys in a crime infested gotham. He wasn't charismatic or charming yet chaos broke out on the streets because he shot a tv show host???? I personally don't need to sympathise with the Joker whether he was forced or driven to madness i wanted to see it and after a full transformation i wanted him to go to Arkham assylum plot an escape and possible turn a pshycologist into Harley Quinn. I wanted an intellgent evil madman but recived a pitiful mentally unstable sad clown. The Joker recieves a 7 because the acting was brilliant the akwardness was real and certain qoutes won't be forgotten like. ""For my whole life i never really knew if i existed"", "

I got so into this movie and story that 2 hours flew, it had my attention the whole time. 90% of the scenes are pure masterpieces, when it comes to photography and writing, music is mesmerizing, fantastic. In the last couple of years i basically gave up on movies, mostly everything new was to some extent bad to me. I'm so glad that this movie was made and that i watched it, i will most definitely watch it again as soon as possible. The way they developed a character, the way that they included mental illnesses, society problems etc... i love it to say at least. This is in the first place psychological movie and then everything else, so know what to expect. "

About the people talking about it affecting mindsets of the audience and leaving a negative impact, it all depends on the interpretation of the viewer. It is really violent and bold. But I never ever think that it will affect people in a bad way. So we should really enjoy it as a film, there have been films that are more violent and they should've not even released...

"," All I saw before seeing this film was media hype. There was going to be violence, it should be banned, people are walking out. It glorifies disenfranchised ""white males"". Gutter trash news like CNN and the Guardian, MSNBC were spreading this vile divisive propaganda. Well have a think about this. Time Warner owns CNN, they also own Warner Bros who made this film. Is it OK to profiteer off peoples fears, to divide people in their countries against each other? Because Hollywood and the Mainstream Media are doing it. And I don't think we should be paying them a damn cent. Other than that garbage this was a great movie. It's not cookie cutter like most of the Marvel films, this movie is it's own monster and is well worth a watch.

I've never been a huge fan of the leading man, I wasn't thrilled about seeing any new film since the last three I walked out on. I walked out on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Ad Astra, and Spider-Man: Far from Home, the first two bored the heck out of me. JOKER, on the other hand, was intense.....I-N-T-E-N-S-E!!! Joaquin Phoenix played his role of a lifetime to perfection. Possibly the most impressive acting I've seen by anyone, in any film, ever! There is NO WAY that he isn't going to get the Best Leading Man award at the next Oscar show, no way. "

The camera work, script, music, settings, etc etc etc....and most of all Phoenix were breathtaking. You could not leave the screen for a second and certain parts just made the hairs on your neck rise.looeath was majestic in TDK, and in his own right, he owned the Joker crown, but Phoenix grabs it and wears it for him with passion and grace. Watching his foot slide on the floor and the arms flay that way deserves the ocsar asap.

3781," Performance of the year
"," Joker. What a fantastic movie definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year a Masterpiece of a performance a fantastic story and a great take on this character.<br/><br/>The performance is incredible if Joaquin Phoenix dosent win an Oscar for his performance in this movie it will be a crime against movies he deserves it.<br/><br/>The story is incredible and seeing this guy just get beat down by society and slowly turn mad is both shocking and compelling to watch.
The last couple of mintues of the movie is just pure Joker and one of my favourite moments in film.<br/><br/>I love the twists and film really plays on this all being made up and all in Jokers head it's genius the way they do it.
The scene where they reveal everything that happened with is girlfriend in the film was all in his head was really well handled.<br/><br/>Now it is a bit of a slow film in my opinion but it's all to felsh out the great story. I also like the idea of Jokers laugh being condition.<br/><br/>The film also makes you question if what the Joker is doing is right you know it's wrong but you also feel for him and want him to have his moment just brilliantly handled.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.9/10 what a fantastic film but slow but the story and performance is amazing and definitely one of the best films I've seen this year. And by far the best performance of the year by Joaquin Phoenix. "
3782," A descent into madness
"," This is brilliant, but disturbing film-making.
Joaquin Phoenix gives an amazing performance as a man being beaten into madness, rather than heading there under his own steam. As such, the film treads a delicate line between feeling pity for Arthur Fleck (Joker), being repulsed and disturbed by him and rooting for him to succeed in his twisted ambitions.
When watching this film, pay attention to Fleck's body language. Observe how, in the comedy club, he doesn't laugh when every else does, and laughs when no-one else does. It is this subtle attention to detail which raises the level of this film.
If this wasn't a ""superhero"" based movie, it would be guaranteed awards. But coming from comic book source material, I suspect that it will be largely ignored come awards season.
Go and see this movie. It is definitely getting crazier out there! "

Release date October 4th, 2019
Audience REACTIONS at its North American PREMIERE:
üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ (5 laughs)
üò± (1 shock)
üèÜ (strong Oscar potential)<br/><br/>Joker (Todd Phillips) provides a divergent take on perhaps the world's most famous fictional villain. Incredibly adept at world building, the film portrays the spirit of the character and the society that failed him through the imagery of the dark city, Gotham. The director described the film as a ""slow burn"", and it was indeed a very slow burn. One should go into the film expecting something very different than the superhero movies we already know the Joker from. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal provides a humanizing origin for the villain. While the viewer knows the character ultimately becomes a villain, it is easy to forget that, seeing instead a troubled man in a broken society; someone who just needed some compassion and kindness. Raising questions about the failings of our own society, it calls for introspection. Joker can first appear bland, but the more one considers it, the more deeply it is felt. "
3784," I watched it twice.
"," This is an epic movie with an amazing performance from Phoenix. I was able to really feel his pain and illness. If you a person who likes comicbooks, then you must watch this movie. If you have never read any comicbook in your life, you will really enjoy this movie as well. "
3785," Amazing move joker is iconic
", Story and acting was perfect. johain used all his skills to the end. 
3786," 10/10 for everything
"," Oh my....and for years Heath Ledgers version of Joker was my favourite, up until now, I thought Joaquin Phoenix version was as equally if not just about marginally better, a very worthy Oscar winning performance, he was outstandingly brilliant from start to finish, and the story filled in a lot of early story arc for the batman movies, I hope the director Todd Phillips and Joaquin get to continue this story and bring Batman into the fold that would be epic "
3787," BEST MOVIE I have seen since I don't even know when
", Is there a way to rate 1000000000000000000/10? The movie explains the backstory so well but it doesn't bore you. When I saw it in theaters I was shocked at how well Joaquin Phoenix played the role because everything seemed so real. I loved Heath Ledger but I think Joaquin Phoenix comes first because of the PERFECT fitting role!!! 
3788," Movie of the year for me.
"," This film messes with your emotions. There are scenes where you are not sure if you should laugh or feel sad (kind of how Fry from Futurama was conflicted with fear and joy when sentenced to death by snu-snu). There are moments that make you laugh (if you like dark humor like me). The comedy is similar to Joan Cornella's morbid comedic illustrations.
Joaquin Phoenix's acting makes the character believable. His unique laughter sounds a bit painful and sad. When the situation goes south, the actor does a great job of performing the fight or flight behavior. Joaquin has an interesting and kind of silly way of running that fits the clown character appropriately (because he is a clown, it makes sense to me). The character is not a simple, black and white personality, instead he is a complex multi-layered individual that makes him entertaining to observe.
The movie is realistic/grounded. Corrupt behavior is created and not born and there is tons of research to back this up. The Joker was not born with a corrupt mind. The film does a great job showing how the environment molded his corrupt behavior. Thomas Wayne's portrayal is believable because someone in his position of wealth and power would behave the way he does (although there are a few wealthy people out there that are cool).
The film has high quality violence (laugh out loud). This movie makes the violence feel shocking and serious. Other movies have too much violence that it starts to feel cheap and not a big deal (these films are still fun to watch though).
This is one of the reasons why I love video games like The Last of Us or movies like Coco because they put plenty of effort in all of the departments (story, character development, believable acting, and an effective atmosphere). It is a memorable experience, it has substance, and it made me feel like this **** matters. Movie of the year for me. "
3789," A true masterpiece of cinema
"," I thought this movie was true cinema; the story of a man on the brink of collapse and how he indulged in his true self really captivated me; and all of these people saying the movie condones violence aggravates me totally. The movie gives a voice to the world of mental health, and while the true character is a villain and justice serves him, the movie does well to allow sympathy from the audience to take place and see where his actions and thoughts are coming from. Philips and Phoenix should be highly praised for their artistic views on the character and the story, along with the rest of the crew for making a truly beautiful film. Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's soundtrack also gave a somber but beautiful addition to this film! "
3790," Cinema at its extreme edge.
",
3791," brilliant!!! One of the best movies of this decade!
"," I created an imdb account only to give this movie a 10/10 because I really disagree with the negative critics. A brilliant, dark, disturbing and moving masterpiece of a movie that makes you think and question your definitions of good and bad. Unlike the opinion of the critics, the fact that the movie uses the character of the joker to connect a comic personality to the complex development of mental illness and to hold a mirror in front of the problems of today's society is exactly what makes this movie so brilliant to me.
And then there is the outstanding and brilliant acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It feels like he put 200% of himself into this role and he portrays the highly complex levels of mental illness and the character development of Arthur Fleck slowly becoming the Joker in an outstanding way. Brilliant performance that truly felt like art, this is what real acting should be like. Hands down deserves to win the Oscar for this!
Go and watch the movie! Unless you want to see a Joker action flick ;-) "

And really need to appreciate it for psychological and emotional issues that is what becomes apparent of how and why arthur becomes the joker... 
3803," PERFECT
"," I really dont know what to say about this movie, it was a masterpiece. Joaquin Phoenix absolutely deserves an oscar, every single scene was perfect, his laugh was CRAZY, the fact that he lost 52 pounds (23 kilograms) for this role is just unbelievable. The music tells you what Arthur is feeling inside of him, he's mad, he's angry, he's bored, he's depressed, he's sad, he wants to kill everyone, it just gives you chills, hats off to Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. The movie isn't just about a guy who turns into THE JOKER because of society, No, it tells you the truth of the world that we live in nowadays and the truth of our society. The movie is so dark exactly like it should be and exactly like we all wanted it to be. The script is perfect and written in a very smart way. The thing that i didnt like about the movie is that we didnt see Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz that much, and makes sense cause the movie is about ARTHUR FLICK but i really wanted more of Robert De Niro, also the movie didnt show us the relationship and the romance side between Arthur Flick and Sophie Dumond they just talked in the elevator and he was imaging stuff in his head like he kissed her and they went out together and thats it. Makeup was amazing and accurate, really loved it. Also really loved the ending that was unexpected (when you see the trailer) but then when you watch the movie you know that he is going to kill Murray (Robert De Niro) because he had the gun with him and then we were all sitting on the edge of our seats, and we were all nervous about it and then when he shot him it was just so shocking. The movie is so deep and the ending is still unknown, at the end when Aurther was laughing and told the psychiatrist ""i just thought of something funny, ""but you wouldnt get it"" then a flashback to Bruce Wayne on the crime alley with his parents dead in the ground and I found it wierd why would Arthur find this funny? There are many questions on this movie and that's what makes it a great movie. Hats off to all the cast and crew and to Todd Philips for giving us that masterpiece. "
3804," One of most outstanding films I've seen in a long time
"," This movie is a masterpiece. The performance is superb, so dark and so humorous.
Such a twisted mind from the abuse being abandoned as a child, being adopted, the lies he was told sets up the character. He's a therapist dream and a nightmare at the same. The movie was also such a social statement, people looking for someone a here if you may to release their anger and it did with Joaquin's performance. Their Hero the Joker "

"," Oppression is the only feeling after u seeing this. What makes a devil an actual devil? --the Environment we are living in. An appearance of a malicious fragment is definitely out of the reasons of the inexcusable egoism, selfishness and hostility in the nature of human beings. Joker was not only a victim, but also a winner who lit the fuse of maleficence-the outbursts in silence in horrors. Everyone who suffers the pain is paying for their ignorance. Finally, The question will always be: What makes the Saints more saintly? The Evil, here, the Joker! "
3808," Amazing movie
"," Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. this is far froma typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/ drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.

"," Watching a man, eaten up by mental disorder and other, mostly brutal daily problems, becoming the Joker really was uncomparabely well acted by everyone and especially by Mr. Joaquin Phoenix. When he dances, almost levetating down the stairs you really see that he is free as a bird. That almost had me in tears. To me, it was a wonderful and beautiful story. When it was only two days out in Germany, I already watched it two times. My new favourite film, period.
And never forget: ""That's life"". "
3815," Pure, Original, Must-Watch
"," This movie has the perfect blend of dark humor, thrill, suspense, and purity. The entire storyline was constructed so beautifully I could not find myself to be distracted at all during the movie. (Granted I received some negative criticisms from my boss that I was not responding to his emails:)<br/><br/>Joker is a character study on Arthur Fleck, a misjudged outcast in Gotham City who struggles to find his place. Joaquin Phoenix beautifully takes on the role of Joker and portrays the character with the right amount of emotion.<br/><br/>Joker has a lot of symbolism and might be confusing to some people. Director Todd Philips has put in a lot of dream sequences that play out in Arthur's mind and a lot of real-life sequences. This can be hard to discern sometimes. However, this enables us to see into the mind of Arthur Fleck and understand as to why he believes in some things that we may find unsettling.<br/><br/>Hands-down, the best part of the entire movie was the Murray Franklin show scene. Joker delivers an awesome quote which goes like this: ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that treats him like trash? YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!!!!"" He then proceeds to shoot Murray in the head, proving that the people who abuse the powers of being rich because of a distinct boundary between the poorer class and the richer class will always fail in the end.<br/><br/>The ending scene was beautiful. When the psychiatrist asks Arthur, ""What's so funny?"". Arthur replies, ""You wouldn't get it"". We then cut to Bruce Wayne standing in the dark alley in front of his parents' dead corpses. And then we cut back to Arthur Fleck skipping down the asylum's white hallway leaving behind bloody footprints before being chased down by a security guard. This signifies that Arthur has just murdered the psychiatrist and just doesn't care about life anymore. The final joke is the mirror image that Arthur realizes is between him and Bruce Wayne. Both have now lost their parents and both have now become outcasts in society. "
3816," A Psycologicaly thrilling look on society and the tale of a broken man
",
3817," It's not a comic book movie
"," ""Best comic book movie to date"" If you go in expecting this movie to be another flashy, over the top feel good movie then you will be disappointed, and completely miss the point of the film altogether. He is a character from the comics, and that's where the ties end.<br/><br/>There's been lots of comparisons/rankings between all of the Jokers that have appeared on screen, ie Ledger and Nicholson, which is a slap in the face to all actors involved. Each actor does an impeccable job with the character in their own right, but Joaquin Phoenix had the task of doing something that hadn't been fully done on screen yet: he had to become the Joker. We catch a glimpse of Jack Napier in Batman becoming Joker, but that was chemically induced, and he was greed and revenge driven. This Joker is the result of a lifetime of abuse and disappointment and neglect. I had always wondered what could have happened to him that would cause him to be so crazy. The fact that it took 40 years for him to snap and not before is incredible. This results in the completely insane and destructive Joker that we have all come to expect to see.<br/><br/>I was expecting a blood bath from the little bit of headlines that I accidentally paid attention to, and that was not the case at all. There is violence, but it's appropriately used, and not so completely over the top that it over shadows the rest of the movie. Critics are just playing along with the over sensitive nature of the world as of late, don't pay any attention to them, or you will miss out on an amazing movie. "

"," It's been a while since a real and good movie was released. The last 2-3 years were a succession of 'so so' movies with no depth, PC ones and of course $200 millions budget Avengers and others garbage fest(the 1st iron man and avengers were decent).
Joker is a real movie, entertaining, making you think, and of course creating a wide range of emotions: disgust, fear, empathy, angriness, joy, sadness... I doubt that Phillips voluntarily implanted all these concepts but rather try to describe a story that is real in a sense and so it is relatable.
I saw some critics and I don't get them. Do they know what movies are about ? They just take shortcut, have no clue about societal issues and how assassins and dictators rise. Most of them focus on how the movie tries to make you empathic with psychopaths; it does not and the 4th murder confirms this. It just tells us that society makes us good or bad and than humans are complex and fragile. So ignore these joker of a critic. "
3833," Phoenix nails it
"," I cannot believe what a great actor Joaquin Phoenix is. From the evil emperor in Gladiator, an odd detective, a guy that falls in love with an operating system and now Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Only few actors reach the same height, but none would've played this role so well, not even Heath Ledger. Ledger's performance was legendary, but it takes another skill set to play an origin story.
I cannot help but feel empathy for poor Arthur, who is trying to live by the rules which a society that spits on him have enforced upon him. He actually seeks help, but the system fails him.  I still felt myself rooting for Arthur, I could certainly understand his motivation.
This might be the best film of this decade. I really hope Phoenix reprises this role in a later film. The score, cinematography, acting are all at least 9,5/10. Extremely recommended! "
3834," I feel bad for the Joker!
"," What a heart breaking life he has lived, from mental illness to child abuse, it shattered me. I cried for him. I also love villains and horror/gore so seeing him become Joker so fast, gave me goosebumps. Amazing film, I sure hope for a sequel! "
3835," A masterpiece that is created in decades
"," From the beginning of the movie, i felt so attached with the character. I could see, it was portraying a lot of people's lives. I would see the violent part as it is, we should address it as reality rather than some fake looking acting. The movie is already 18+. So, talking about the violence doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>One of the best pictures of this decade which a lot of people would empathize. "

", I absolutely love this movie I can relate with the joker so much it's crazy I don't think this movie encourages violence I think it encourages everybody to be a bit little bit nicer to everyone in this world cuz when you treat people like crap sometimes they can't take it anymore and take drastic actions but yeah love this movie I didn't think it was possible to beat Heath Ledger's Joker but Joaquin Phoenix has done that he is now my new favorite Joker such a beautiful movie 
3838," Phoenix did not disappoint
"," I was really looking forward to Joker, mainly because Joaquin Phoenix was starring and really knows how to play a demented character. He played it better than I can adequately describe...and dare I say better than Ledger's Joker IMO. The only part of the movie that I feel didn't adequately gel with the character was the shooting of the talk show host played by DeNiro. There was almost an anit-hero sentiment for Joker and how outside forces built the monster, until the on-air shooting. I mean if he already had a following built from the Subway shootings, to me the on-air killing was incongruent with the character as I thought it was stupid. To me, any talk show host would have cut the show well before anyone was shot. That piece could have been better represented to keep with the other two hours of the movie. Anyway, I give it 9/10 stars because of the on-air shooting. "

3840," A Fantastic Character Study of a Famous Villain
"," This film brings its own atmosphere to the viewer as you are taken on a dark but mildly hilarious journey of the famous arch nemesis of Batman. Phillips achieves this with NO CGI AT ALL! Which is a relief in comparison to the MCU films and other DC properties which have solely relied on this. Phoenix also lives up to his name of restricting a character which Leto destroyed in Suicide Squad and getting the audience to support Arthur's Fleck's descent into a life of madness, murder and violence on the streets of Gotham city. The last 20 minutes are a bit on the nose, but still satisfying to watch as the same. This movie single handidly puts the rest of the DCEU in the shade, and is well worth the watch! "

3844," Watch It!!!
"," Alright, so this is my first review but I felt like I had to talk about it. I'm 14 years old and went to see this with my friend. Now, I consider myself quite mature for my age in terms of movies, so I knew that this wasn't gonna be the usual comic book movie but goddamn was this a pleasant surprise. Firstly, the acting in this movie is incredible, especially Joaquin Phoenix. The cinematography is also great and the music is phenomenal. I've read some criticism around the movie surrounding the fact that it borrows stuff from Taxi Driver and King of comedy. I can't comment on king of comedy as I have not seen it yet, but I have seen Taxi Driver so I can comment on that. I can see the influence, but I don't think it borrows that much from it. The basic plot setup is the same, but the execution is so different so I wouldn't compare the two. All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough.<br/><br/>10/10 would forget the snacks I brought with me again "
3845," Great hipe for an above average movie
", The movie is about origin of the joker character presenting how and why he is wat he is later.. Here I give great credit for jaquin phenix for his great role. But did the story evolve..? This is where the story fails..the movie fails to convince the audience that joker is bad yes because people are treating him bad.. Yes the system can corrupt many of us but to what extent.. So there is a missing link I didn't understand if more than half of the movie the joker is being fucked up by everyone ND he is very mentally sick.. But sudenlly the movie twist so fast to the opposite twisted serial killer that enjoys killing people for getting even..being a serial killer with no morals ND enjoying it has nothing to do with your past.. Hitler was originally a painter.. For me a movie like falling down for Michael Douglas was much much original.i felt very close resemble she between both movies. ND very solid than this one..heath ledger and Jack nickelson will always remain the most original jokers ever..

Unfortunately, with all the mass PR and fake reviews here, it's hard to get a clear image of how good this movie is.<br/><br/>Well, it's watchable and Phoenix's acting is pretty good but def not close to his Gladiator acting level. Also, the script/story is too shallow and all over the place.<br/><br/>Wish it was better:/ "

Despite this, I was also totally scared of him. JP's performance made me laugh, cry, and also left scarred by how mesmerisingly unstable his character portrayal of Arthur was. Everything is stunning, the acting, the score, the cinematography, the editing and pacing is also seriously not being talked about enough too. Simply a masterpiece in film.

I'm talking about every thing in this movie was just so amazing (sorry I was kinda of over reacting ) but believe me this movie is the only movie that i can really say is perfect (in my opinion) from the soundtrack to the cinemathography to the characters development it makes you really understand the joker s' character from the joker himself 's point of vue "

3857," A Great Analysis of the White Supremacist Male's Mind
"," This movie was way overhyped. I knew nothing was going to happened at movie theaters, yet I was bored and went to go check this movie out since the media said not to. I'm fifty percent sure, it could have been a publicity stunt from the studios to draw more interest in a movie, which was not as violent as Sylvester Stallone's Rambo: Last Blood or the John Wick movies. I don't get white guys'' fascination with murdering psychopaths or the necessity of making a movie about a fictional white guy comic book villain who thinks it's fun to murder people. Yet, they were excited about this movie. I'll admit it was a good story, a good character analysis of the making of a serial killer, and Joaquin Phoenix committed the heck to this role (one of his best performances) and deserves Oscar recognition, but I found nothing extra about it. It represents how the media likes to paint white supremacist males as the victims or in a sympathetic light. Who cares about their victims who names get lost or forgotten in the story, let's make their white supremacist male the victim, the hero, and if the victim is the wrong color or socioeconomic status, let's paint them as the villain responsible for their own demise. Villains, fictional or real, get documentaries or myriads of movies made about them as the media loves to analyze the psyche of these characters almost as if it's a fetish.<br/><br/>There is even one scene which stood out to me about the black female neighbor who he fantasized he had a whole relationship with in his mind, and the audience doesn't realize it wasn't real until she finds him in her apartment unexpected sitting on her sofa. She tells him he's in the wrong apartment and fearfully begs him to leave. The audience is left wondering whether he killed
her or not. I wondered if this scene was an inside joke about what happened last year when a Dallas police officer Amber Guyger killed a black man named Botham Jean in his apartment and said her reason was she was in the wrong apartment and thought it was her own apartment. She was recently sentenced to ten years in prison, but since the star witness another black man named Joshua Brown was murdered in a funny style at his apartment complex too, it's uncertain whether she will serve time. <br/><br/>The scene which stood out the most to me was the one with the fat guy and the midget. This is also one of those rare moments in the twilight of his career do we get to see Robert Deniro actually act instead of phoning in a performance for a paycheck. He was the second best actor in this movie. I didn't get all the horrible dance scenes and tai chi scenes after he murdered someone. Yet, it made it into the trailer. But it was great movie which shows how Gotham made Joker and the Batman and why their fates will always be intertwined until one kills the other. It's a dance which will never end and that's the greatest joke of them all.<br/><br/>So it's a good movie. Go watch it when you have the most energy. I had to drink a coke not to fall asleep and the couple next to me fell asleep and snored very loudly during the second half of the movie. Great analysis of a white supremacist male, great Joker story, great writing, wonderful cast, and great cinematography. So if you're into movies about serial killers and analysis about the minds of psychopaths, you'll enjoy. If you're not into that or Batman, then you are going to ask yourself, ""What in the world did I just watch?"" "
3858," ""What is wrong with all you people?"": ""Joker"" is an unbelievable dark and conflicting movie
"," Well, it is usually very hard to say anything after something so disturbing as this movie, but ""Joker"" was thought-provoking, intense and extremely powerful, it was something unseen for the last 10 years. Comedy, tragedy, imaginary love story, pain, violence, conflicts - it looked so real and this usually makes one movie a masterpiece. I mean, Arthur was a man having lots of conflicts and involved in different contexts with different characters. He was simultaneously the villain and the hero, most of his actions were absolutely horrible, but they actually made sense in these contexts. His final confrontation against Murray was one of the best scenes I have ever experienced - his style, his movement, the way he talked...amazing. He could never win this fight against society, but let's face it: he is the one who makes sense and not Batman. Everybody wants to be the hero, defeat the bad guy, win the girl at the end and live happily ever after, but that's not always the case and it is definitely sad.<br/><br/>""Joker"" is the movie DC really needed - after I wasted my time with movies like ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League"" I really expected something different from them and they finally delivered a quality product. DC comics have 3 A-list characters: Batman, Superman and the Joker and people expect top movies with these guys. Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Flash are there for the entertainment and they don't deliver high ratings or fans. Amazing choice to do this movie and great job by both Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. They really managed to match the quality of ""Avengers: Endgame"" and also outshine ""Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood"" in the run for the Oscars. I am really looking forward to see Christian Bale and ""Ford v Ferrari"", but right now Joaquin Phoenix is a big contender for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"". "
3859," Great Movie
"," After watching the new Todd Phillip's movie ""Joker"", I think that this is a great movie about society and its aftermath, but as a film about the iconic DC comic book antagonist, it is rather empty because this is no joker pre-history, but rather an arbitrary director's way of attracting viewers to the cinema thanks to its intriguing title. Therefore, it should be viewed as a social drama, not a comic book screening.<br/><br/>For those who want to know how this hero came about, I suggest you read ""The Killing Joke"" or at least watch a cartoon showing the birth of Joker.<br/><br/>P.S. I hope Joaquin Phoenix gets an Oscar. "
3860," Better than Superman V Batman! Ha ha ha...!!!
",
3861," I still need to see it a couple of times
"," The story is so plausible that sometimes it hurts to know that yes, that would happen and yes, that man would be in a lot of pain. That takes me to the acting. The secondary characters do exactly what they should do, they raise the main character up in the spotlight and maaaan, does Phoenix deliver. He is grotesque, yes, horrible, yes, but soo humane, you really get to see his point of view and at the end..you kinda are glad that through all this bullshit he actually gets to be happy. Some sort of happiness and that makes you see soo clear why the joker never gets killed in so many battles. You get to see the hero behind the villain.<br/><br/>This movie couldn't be better, no movie could do this better. "
3862," You're not gonna smile, but you will enjoy every second
"," This movie is a bad joke, for the first time we see the world in Joker's pont of view, you shouldn't belive in everything that is shown, just take whatever you like.
He is not a poor little and weak guy the whole movie, and the bad treatment that society provides him is not an excuse, he kills for fun, we all get that when Arthur kills... Nah, ain't gonna spoil hahahahah "
3863," Outstanding
"," This is one of the few movies where I went in with high expectations and wasn't left dissapointment. The hype is real. The slow build up of tension, in depth character development, interesting shots and Joaquim's brilliant acting made for an amazing film.

"," In the name of God
As someone who's watched and watched almost every Hollywood, Bollywood, and Korean movie
I think jokes are people's mirrors
He's not a stranger, the view that Joker is a murderer is true; that he is crazy, too.
But since we are the mirror, we are at the heart of this incident.
They were us, ordinary people who needed spark (Joker)
Each of us is a killer and a joker who just needs a spark to get out "
3868," Let me tell you a joke
"," This is an instant classic. The best movie I can remember seeing at the cinema, and I think it rightly takes its place in the top ranks of IMDb.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix offers a masterclass in performance, I have never seen anything like it.
The story is so well paced, every step along the way and each character development make perfect sense, and in the end come together to create a 100% believable anti-hero.<br/><br/>Nowhere along the story did I doubt the realism of the story unfolding, nothing was ""a stretch"". It all fell into place intuitively, and seeing the Joker literally being created from the society he is in was a blast, and it was depressing, and it was stunning.<br/><br/>Adding this level of realism and groundedness to a character we previously knew only in a different light really hit home for me.
It ties in perfectly into the Batman saga as well, creating a perfectly realistic bridge between the Batman stories we know and our world.<br/><br/>Along with the stellar acting, the score, directing, cinematography, camera, costume design, EVERYTHING is on such a high level, I will not be surprised to see some Oscar nominations coming this way.<br/><br/>Much more than simply a good 'comic movie' this was just a great film in every way.
'JOKER' is a very special picture, something that comes along only every so often, and that truly impacts you during and after viewing it.<br/><br/>Now if you'll excuse me, I'll have to get a ticket for my second viewing. 10/10 "
3869," It is just THAT GOOD
"," To start, the whole ""this movie is dangerous""
I get why people say that but they are just really exaggerating.<br/><br/>Second of all,
Most of you know that this movie is really inspired by Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.
That's one of the problems I have with this movie.
Don't get me wrong. I still think it's a masterpiece it's just that, if this movie went a little bit different than Taxi Drivers' story, it could have been a bit different.
But still, it's just a minor problem and this movie is still amazing.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with it is that it went a bit faster than I expected...
Just in a few scenes...
Like, after he killed those three people that beat him he run out of the train station and into a dark toilet.
I get why he was dancing but, it was a bit weird to see him going from killing three people straight to slow (and creepy) dancing.
I kinda got out of the...experience...?
I don't know how to put it into words...
In that moment I felt...like I was watching a movie...in a theater...
But, Joaquin Phoenixs' performance was just absolutely terrifyingly good.
And I got right back to ""watching"" Arthur Fleck (if you can still call him that).<br/><br/>The thing with Thomas and Bruce Wayne was kinda...unnecessary?
But not really...it was a nice addition to the plot and I didn't really mind it.
But if it wasn't there I think this movie would have been almost the same.<br/><br/>Overall...
Amazing
I give this movie a 9.5/10 (I can't give it that in the normal rating system so I gave it a 10) "

This film is just simply a masterpiece! If I could think of any words that are higher than a masterpiece then I would say it. Critics no longer know what a good movie is. "
3871," Heath Ledgers Joker was far superior.
"," As for the Joaquin Phoenix better joker, i disagree. Heath Ledgers Joker was far superior, the raw edge and calculated genius of the joker acted out by brilliantly down to the way he moves and spoke. Joaquin Phoenix joker seems like an ordinary mad man which could be you or could be me, and we havent seen enough of his joker we see and attach to Arthur Fleck not the Joker. An enjoyable 2 hours as the gothom descends into chaos. The main play here is clearly mental illness which lately every man and his dog seem to have, thus making the movie relatable. The connection to the joker comes in the form of his day dreams (which we all do but will have you question if your mad to) which Arthur Fleck soon realises he is an evil. I think the link to Thomas Wayne didnt need to be there, as when we think the bigger batman world it is all a little close. "
3872," Joker
"," Good. yes, bit only good.
Jhoaquin espectacular, it's true. "
3873," Heartbreakingly Beautiful
", Within 15 minutes I already had tears in my eyes. My heart was with the Joker from the beginning to the very end of this movie. Never before have I been so moved by such a seemingly evil character.<br/><br/>Joaquin's performance is nothing other than a master piece. Flawless.<br/><br/>What this movie teaches us about mental health and the failing system we all live in is incredibly eye opening.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see this again and again. 
3874," Great story, great movie, another classic
"," If you don't take this movie out of context, it is exactly what it should be. If you know the Joker and his story, this would be a perfect explanation of why he does what he does. Falling in acid just didn't make sense, this does! It's not bad to feel empathy for the guy, we all do, and that's what makes the movie so great. It makes you actually feel empathy for a lunatic, that's the whole point! And for the sad people who rate this movie poorly, they're just catching themselves feeling empathy for a killer, and they can't handle the truth. And as most people who can't handle the truth, they start blaming others, the movie in this case, instead of their own, not understanding the movie. Also, I recommend you to watch The Dark Knight, Batman (1989) and some other joker clips on YouTube before Joker, to fully understand this joker and where he came from. It's sad a lot of people just ruin this movie because they know nothing about the Batman series and the Joker. "
3875," Exceptional!! I am glad this movie exists..!!

3876," Sadness behind the Smile
"," Every portrayal of the Joker is unique and this one is no exception. This 122 minute dive into the mental state of one of, if not THE most iconic DC villain is spectacular to say the least. Arthur Fleck is a down on his luck clown for hire, living with his mother in Gotham, but as Joker said himself in The Killing Joke, it only takes one BAD day to bring someone down to his level of insanity, and this is our ticket to see what it was.<br/><br/>Is there violence?
Is it disturbing?
If you're asking these questions you don't know Joker. Yes, and this is par for the course.<br/><br/>Is this meant to justify Joker's actions?
No, it's meant to show you how we got to where he is now.<br/><br/>Is this supposed to make us sympathize with him?
Do that at your own peril, Harley did that and look what happened to her. "
3877," all I can say is ""wow""
"," Joaquin Phoenix puts forward one of the best acting performances of our generation. I still watch the Dark Knight to this day for Heath Ledger's incredible performance. While it is certainly unfair to compare one's rendition to the other, I never thought I would see the Joker brought to life in as dynamic of a way as Ledger's Joker, but Phoenix certainly did so.
The movie is deeply disturbing and is an emotional roller-coaster. Without revealing spoilers, the movie is about a severely mentally ill man who is becoming more and more psychotic as society pushes him away and into madness.
The ending. I can't even put it into words. All I will say is this: when Phoenix goes full ""Joker"" at the end, I had goosebumps on my arms for minutes. When you watch the movie, you will know the exact moment I'm talking about.
For me, this was one of those movies that will be talked about for years to come. "

"," Review Joker (2019)<br/><br/>
This is a much of feelings, this movie is incredible, raw, and necessary to the society who we live today, this movie is better than hype, photography, Phoenix, is fenomenal, and he deserve a nomination in the Oscar, I don't like so much to compare movies, but I'm sorry, this movie is the best of the year, go to the cinema, don't afraid, because ever moment in this movie is a punch in your stomach, If you like the joker character, You love this movie, because Arthur fleack is insane, crazy mind, and you have compassion for him, but in the same time you understood what he did is wrong, that's is the duality, and the movie is very influenced by movie of Scorsese, How taxi driver, king of Comedy, and doses of ultra violence, clockwork orange, or the Phoenix movies too, you never really here, it's a social critic of your society, Gotham is a dirty, corrupt, don't have health, safety, the government don't give it your own citizens, the citizens don't have job, this is a movie to think, a lot, rethink ""polemical themes"", who is the better government, people who have mental issues, deserve treatment, and stop the bullying your the fake news, don't matter, who is your political position, see the people, have empathy for them, when a society is sick, the retreat is a problem candidate, Joker so is a movie adaptation of the comics, have similarities with Dark knight, by Frank Miller comics, and the killing Joke, By Alan Moore, I think now is the best adaptation of a movie adaptation of a comic book, Phoenix honors Heath Ledger, this movie is euphoric, phenomenal, and deserve your time, go to the cinema, and watch this movie!!!
This movie is hard to digest, heavy, and don't let kids watch this movie, is a adult movie, one study of human Psyche, you imerge in the mind of joker, this movie will be a classic over de years "

3881," 8.5 rating
"," The movie had a amazing acting by joaquin phoenix, great diercting and cinematography but it took alot of things from taxi driver and the king of comedy and this was the biggest issue in the movie. The second issue that the movie focused on the physiological part of arthur flick we didn't see a real joker except at the last 15 minutes of the movie so the movie is so great and one of the best movies of 2019 but it's still not a masterpiece "
3882," JOKER on the inside just shines
"," I still can't move on, I guess Arthur was right. Always put a happy smile on your face. But at the end of the day, that's life. Your life might be a comedy, but still it revolves negative things that might trigger you as a person, and as a human being. I got mixed reaction with the story, and how the movie end up. But still, Joaquin Phoenix is really top of my favorite actors from before up to now. Joker sets the bar. It was really dark and a deep movie. Everytime Joker laugh because of his illness mixing with his emotion that was sad, just hit me so hard. The kid scene with his mom, train scene with those three guys and the stairs where Arthur Fleck was dancing, really just phenomenal. Indeed, it has a political vibe wherein it provides hints of reality and gruesome acts. I still believe on movies that provide entertainment and this movie is definitely one of it. I'm happy and sad that I get to watch this on my Birthday. Joker is an Art and a dark reality of one's emotion. "
3883," The jolt of original greatness can sometimes throw the audience for a loop
"," As it has soaked in more, and I keep not being able not to think about it..I think the Joker is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>As far as any of the negative reviews--This has happened before, and not just with movies. People hated on Moby Dick when it was first published. But decades later the consensus was that it was a masterpiece. Expectations based on Herman Mellville's previous adventure stories had a lot to do with that... And I think people who have expressed distaste for it as being excessive (and I wrestled with that while watching)--well, look at A Clockwork Orange. Taxi Driver. The Deer Hunter. All with shocking stuff. Deliverance. Scar Face.<br/><br/>Pfft, and this movie was better than Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter. And at least as good as the others, in my opinion. Probably ties with Clockwork, for me, but I haven't seen that since I was 17 (now 52)--but I have read the book since then twice, so that's where I'm probably making the comparison.<br/><br/>If I don't see it in theaters again I may have to buy Joker when it is released on disc. There's so much there. And I think for a ""character study"" where we never leave arthur's side, that's quite an accomplishment. And as one reviewer wrote: this didn't even have to be in the DC universe, it's so believable, relevant, its own stand-alone story.<br/><br/>Also, some seemed not to like it as a commentary on society, on how some evil people are formed, on the effects upon the downtrodden and dispossessed. To that I say PSHAW. The effective hammer-blow of an illustration or an allegory is sometimes needfully created by hyperbole. THIS Joker origin-story is as disturbing and as powerful as it is because of the recurring real-world stories it reflects back to us in its horror-house colors. The mass-murderers that have been among us and are still among us don't need this movie for inspiration. But the film's insights into the ramifications of wealth-driven elitism, of cruelty, and of apathy--those insights don't excuse violent rage--but I think they do legitimately spotlight some fuel sources for the fire. "
3884," Critics are wrong about Joker
"," I saw this film with high expectations and I was not disappointed. I was transfixed. Joker is a beautiful work of art that everyone should see and judge for themselves.
I'm convinced that the bad reviews are either politically motivated or the critics did not see the movie. There's nothing about this movie that incites incell violence or promotes alt-right nonsense.
It's just a good movie. Go see it. "

"," JOKER Review<br/><br/>The Beginning<br/><br/>Joker, voted as the most anticipated movie of 2019, theorised to grab all the oscars and walk away with flawless scorings of 10/10 and 100%. While the acting in this movie deserved all the anticipation and hype, that can't be said about the rest of the work on this movie. This is the first movie Todd Phillips has done that is very serious, doing titles such as the hangover trilogy which are mostly comedy. While he did a creditable job with his other films his should maybe stick to what is suitable for his style of writing.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>Joker is a good movie, to call it bad would be a massive disrespect to Joaquin Phoenix, Lawrence Sher (cinematography) and Todd Phillips (in his directing). Before I explain why this take on Joker was so good, I would like to just say that I will not compare Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger as they are two VERY different takes and should not be compared. Well why did this take on Joker work? Joker has always been a character that has fought with ""The Good Guy"" while he takes the role of ""The Bad Guy"".<br/><br/>This take had Joker fighting himself and society, which on paper sounds like it would be an edgy, wanna be dark movie idea. But, it really works. The idea of him fighting with both his own mental state and the people that don't understand that he is mentally ill, which is increasingly impacted by the fact that the mental health care within gotham city is shut down. The best example I can think of that shows the excellent structure of that section of the movie is the episodes with the girl.<br/><br/>Joker (Arthur Fleck) later in the movie comes back from a train ride and walks into a lady's apartment in his building and they ""make out"". She then goes on a date with him, later goes to a comedy show with him and then sits with him while he watches his mother in hospital. Again later Joker comes home and goes into her apartment and sits on the couch. The woman comes out of her kids room and sees him. She gets freaked out and says ""hey what are you doing here, this isn't your apartment."" and joker looks confused.<br/><br/>The camera zooms in of his face and then a flashback sequence occurs in which it shows the scenes where he was with the girl, turns out she was never there and it was his mind that placed her there with him. That part of the movie was done so well as it subverts all expectations of lovey dovey lady helps the criminal and falls in love with him. Nothing can best psychological themes when done right, it really showed the strong suit of some of the writing.<br/><br/>Joaquin does a terrific job with his body language as whenever he wants to exaggerate something his controls his facial expression to express exactly what he wants the audience to feel, mainly using his eyes and extremely skinny torso to portray his messed mental state. Many scenes had Joker dancing without his shirt, you can see bruises and you can see his rib cage right against his skin.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now the directing and cinematography is very well done, all camera placements match the emotion that is in the scene. Colours are used to show emotion perfectly with shades of blue and grey and red used with sadness, discomfort and anger.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The Bad<br/><br/>Now due to this movie not being written by little kids i'm going to be brutally honest. The one simple rule for the most part in movies is SHOW DON'T TELL. They decided that the best way to follow that rule was to not. Bad call. 20 minutes in they do something that pisses me off so much. So, this movie was about Mental Health issues and how they aren't treated properly and it addresses a lot about mental health.<br/><br/>The way to not do this is exactly what the movie did. 20 minutes in, Joker is writing some jokes down in a book. He writes a joke about Mental Health and they decide the best option is to zoom in and focus on the words ""mental health"" that is a clear example of telling not showing, major mistake that should have been so obvious not to do. The writing in this movie is at points very good and then it weakens down, this weakens the good as the flow is ruined.<br/><br/>The writers (Todd Phillips and Scott Silver) have tried to put a bunch of stories together which did not work, for example there are a few too many meaningless scenes in which Joker is dancing, I understand this is supposed to be a way to show his mental state and extreme lack of weight but it takes away from the ending scene in which Joker dances on the hood of a police car in front of thousands of people wearing clown masks which would have been incredibly powerful if it did not overuse the dancing thing.<br/><br/>The speed of the movie is very wonky, there will be intense fast action which then slows down completely to a very slow dancing scene. That isn't the best way to change the pace as it didn't make as much sense, which could be argued that its an example of his mental state but it really doesn't fit in with the other episodes he has. All in all the writing is strong in parts but doesn't hold up when the rest isn't executed well. I don't know if the two writers kept swapping the page when writing it but it seems very zig zag.<br/><br/>The Ugly<br/><br/>This movie was very good looking with its cinematography and didn't have any mistakes or bad camera placements. The only thing I can think of that made a certain scene ugly was (MASSIVE SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST WARNING) - A goon kills Bruce Wayne's parents and the stereotypical pearls dropping to the ground shot that was part slo mo but part normal pace and it felt very out of place.<br/><br/>
The Verdict<br/><br/>Joker was a good attempt at making a psychological, personal conflict, drama. There are some unforgettable scenes in this movie and to be truthful I enjoyed the movie, it's just the weak writing and overuse of slow shots that make this movie not as good as all the advertising hyped up. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance and deserves all the credit he is getting. Joker was perfectly acted, directed and produced, but weak writing is the very structure a movie is based on.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Golden Revolver Award
(award for a movie that does its own style and nails it.) Do note this award is not for the writing at all, this is strictly for Joaquin's acting, The Cinematography and Todd's directing. "
3886," Best comic adaptation
"," What a great movie, nods to the killing joke comic in the film, Joaquin Phoenix performance in the film was brilliant. Great portrayal of what society can do to a man. Outstanding directing, can watch this again and again. Give the Oscar to Phoenix already "
3887," Did I miss something ?!
"," The movie tries to be different, more darker compared to all comics ones. I didn't see a deeper message, I didn't feel at the edge of my seat and I didn't see a WTF plot twist. It's an okay to decent and I am truly suprised by the rating making it a Masterpiece by IMDB standarts. The Joker in the movie is portrayed as really troubled person, in fact so much that its imposible someone like him to walk free in Society. I get its Fiction and some things you have to just ""accept"" but still there are limits and if you are trying to sell a serious idea, you should stick to them. Arthur is completely unlikable, crazy and scarily awkward from every possible angle and somehow he is let to entertain children in a hospital?! They try to sell the idea that Society has pushed him to become who he is but that would have worked a lot better if he was a rather 50-50 normal person with problems. That way while struggling to find his path you could sympatize with him and when cops come to his house and see him, you won't start asking the question why are they such a bad detectives when its obvious that something is not right with that fella. The ending is strange or I didn't get the idea with the love interest. I mean the girl they choose is a solid 9/10 and it was obvious that she is way out of his league and that all of it was in his head.
IMO the creators just wanted to make a complicated movie that would shock the audience but it didn't came organic ... like the Matrix for example. I just read about the director talking about the finale and he was way over with his deeper suggestions about plot holes. "
3888," very good movie, but...

3889," 10/10
"," THE BEST MOVIE EVER, NOTHING ELSE TO SAY........................ "
3890," Some of you need to rewatch it or change brains.
"," This movie is really beyond expectations, imagination and way too far to be understood by some critics. Whoever called it masterpiece, it was low, raise the bar a little higher cause this is universal perfection. Never ever thought i'd see a Joker like this, presented as in the movie, to think, feel, be in his shoes before i thought what a madman would be. That cool guy who kills and laughs, dances, goes instant insane, was a very kind person, with problems. And doesn't end here, in the beginning i was sceptic, thought it was a scam when i first saw his laugh(some critics and i thought it was fake) but, that was wrong, there were tiny bits of parts where he changed, and it felt, victorious, bad, crazy, funny and hell, it felt Joker!
The movie gave you all the feels and moments you need and in opposition to those feels. He fired a gun, fell and turned up the volume on tv, that was the first signs of it's clumsy side and trying to repair what was done, god i was the only one who laughed my ass of in cinema. Then slowly (critics, please, just shove your phd's right up you cause this move you wouldn't get if you don't have a very high EQ and IQ), slowly as i said, that laugh started to get the shape, that perfect shape i always thought it would be. Won't spoil the whole actions in order, do it yourselves, as each dc fan would imagine it, but it was completed in the final with a spectacular oscar. "
3891," Amazing performance and good directing but
"," This movie has a very great performance by joaquin phoenix he did a different and special edition of joker character he had avery special laugh, too. He had a very loudly laugh but he had weak and hurting in himself this was remarkable it makes you fell the pain that he is feeling and he had a great transformation from the the normal physiological patient to high level of physiological problems that make him the joker and made him kill three people, kill his mother and robert de niro character and the movie had a great cinematography and directing, too and the movie had very good plot twists that blowing your mind like that the joker is a half brother to bruce wayne the movie took this plot twist and made a plot twist from a plot twist that the joker's mother is a physiological patient, too and she was lieing about the half brother then we have the great plot twist that all of the movie is just from the imagination of Arthur flick but the movie had a lot of things from Martin scorsese's movies like taxi driver and the king of comedy and that was the biggest issue in the movie. The movie also focused on the physiological part of arthur flick and not the joker we didn't see a real joker with a people improving him except the last 15 minutes of the movie so for me the movie is a great but not a masterpiece. "

3897," Joker Film Review - Todd Phillips Directs Joaquin Phoenix As A Joker Who Is No Fun But Sure Knows How To Make 'Em Laugh - It's A Comic Tragedy
"," Arthur Fleck in Joker is as much a victim of Society as his unfortunate victims. Working at a clown agency with a medical condition that makes him laugh uncontrollably, it's not a funny business for him. He asks for more mental health help, more pills, more than the seven he already takes a day, but Social Services are cut and his pills and therapy part of it. He is abused and attacked at work and is it any wonder he finally snaps. Having a gun should be illegal anywhere. But this is comic book Gotham and these things happen. Todd Phillips directs Joaquin Phoenix as a Joker we can initially sympathise with, while we watch his rage build, and his descent into the Gotham madness begin.<br/><br/>Arthur lives in a crummy apartment with his Mum played by Frances Conroy. He is her gentle carer and watches his mother Penny Fleck as she keeps writing to her ex-boss Thomas Wayne for help. Played by Brett Cullen he isn't listening. And the mood in the street is getting darker with a garbage strike and giant rats scuttling round town. But the mood is light in the Fleck household because they enjoy watching Murray Franklin's nightly talk show together. And in Arthur's head Murray played by Robert De Niro is waiting for him as a guest. For Arthur is a would be stand-up comedian, although Penny drily asks whether you need to be funny to do that. She's a wag, but she has a deep dark family secret buried in Arkham Asylum, one that will see Gotham burn. It's a Shakespearean tragedy.<br/><br/>But Arthur does his comedy homework and learns his trade by watching other comics. Jotting down what makes people laugh. He even meets a girl down the hall and invites her to his first stand-up show. Zazie Beetz's Sophie is not as embarrassed as we are. Make 'em laugh isn't something that Arthur can do, except for his own maniacal laughter the place is silent. But someone is filming.<br/><br/>So Arthur still keeps up his day job, the sad thing is his clown makes kids in a hospital laugh, until a gun drops out of his outfit. Well that's a scream, and of course he's fired. And so is the gun. Mayoral hopeful Thomas Wayne pitches the 'clowns' against the rich, after three of his staff are killed. Causing mass demonstrations in Gotham. We're all clowns now. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and production design by Mark Friedberg is fantastic, a retro 70's Gotham City, (check the WB logo), and like the pre-gentrification of 80's NYC I remember.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix was incredible, he lost 52lbs to play the poor pathetic Arthur. Each sinewy movement of his starved body taut when he practises his quiet tai chi, or maniacal ballet, and all the while straining against the pressure cooker building inside his head.<br/><br/>When the police finally track Arthur down, his mother is home alone when they call, and after suffering a stroke is rushed to hospital, where Arthur and Sophie sit with her. They watch as Murray Franklin shows the film of Arthur's stand-up comedy routine that night. It might not have made the punters laugh, but overnight it makes him a tv star. Finally Arthur gets his chance at prime time tv. But how to play it? He needs to practise. It's funny and sad as he copies the guests on the programme. Creating his entrance. We will him to succeed. Could this be Arthur's shot at being the next King of Comedy. Because Arthur does now feel he exists. The poor and wretched of Gotham all exist now. But was he ever really there? Was Sophie ever really there?<br/><br/>And for his much longed for tv appearance and his opener. Should he thank his mother first?, she nicknamed him Happy after all, telling him to spread joy and happiness in his miserable life. Should he thank his fellow clowns for their help, because Glenn Fleshler's Randall gave him the gun that helped get him here. They'll all get their turn. But Leigh Gill's Gary is too small to even open the door. Maybe he doesn't deserve any thanks.<br/><br/>And maybe after all he'll not even go on as himself, he'll go on as Joker. With amazing hair, make-up and costume created by Mark Bridges, and he'll just tell the truth. And see if they laugh. But you can be sure his act will blow Murray Franklin away.<br/><br/>Outstanding work by Todd Philips in an amazing film. As an origins story we are given the bare bones on which the future of Gotham hangs. And DC is definitely in a dark place with this tragic comic who dances a Catch Me If You Can finale. "

"," The movie was exceptional. It covered all 3 things a good film should. It was surprising, kept the viewer thinking and guessing, and had a sensational main character. The Joker, even though a major villain and a mentally ill criminal, was somehow relatable. Fantastic piece of work! "
3900," Joker What a movie. Amazingly done
"," Joker WOW What a Movie with a fantastic story. I didn't expect it to be as good. Joker exposes the Wayne legacy and is our new Hero, Never seen it from his side of the story.I understand where he comes from and the struggles with life. Rich class heartless and the government system is dead. Very intense. This deserves an Oscar and Mr Phoenix you are a Legend. Amazing acting. "
3901," Menacing
"," Chilling from start to finish, movie almost embodies the joker himself. Absolutely manic and shocking. Loved it "
3902," My opinion about joker
"," Just saw Joker (2019) and I thought it was very interesting and engaging.<br/><br/>Unlike most DC comic movies where the stories are mostly action-oriented, the story for this film is set out to show the tragic backstory of how struggling stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, became the Joker that everyone knows and loves to hate, thanks to his psychological damage and horrible upbringing. So this film is more of a psychological thriller than an action movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare moments where the Joker was actually given a name for his alter ego, Arthur Fleck. Another instance was back in the 1989 Tim Burton Batman Movie, where he was called Jack Napier as his alter ego.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film, we slowly start to see how Arthur's psychological trauma takes a horrible toll on his mental health, due to how he was constantly shunned by society, how he retaliated against society and how it affected the entire city of Gotham and how it affected those who loved him the most.<br/><br/>Plus, aside from Joaquin Phoenix, the only other notable star I could recognise in this movie was Robert DeNiro, which I never knew was in it prior to watching the film.<br/><br/>The costume and make up of the Joker was what caught my attention, as a combination of his maroon and orange suit and having long green hair reminded me of a mix between both Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger's portrayal. Which I thought was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The action may have been few and far between at times, but it was only just the beginning for the Joker. Will there be a sequel for this movie? Only time will tell. It's early days yet to bank on one, but it wouldn't surprise me anyway since DC comics movies get sequels and spin-offs all the time.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 9/10 for its strong story telling, detailed backstory about the psychological trauma Joker himself, a strong leading roll with great costume and make up calling back to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson, a good use of a well-known guest star, which is Robert DeNiro and a realistic depiction of Gotham City and being faithful to the comics as always. "
3903," The Clown Prince of Crime has been unleashed.
"," I will start by saying thank u! Everything about this movie was just a pure masterpiece, from the fantastic music to the beautiful cinematography to the mesmerising Pheonix performance, everything was just perfect, and every crew member deserves a big thank u!
This movie looks and the life of one mentally ill Arthur Fleck. I have never seen a movie with such a perfect character development, when u look at Arthur at the beginning and the the Joker in the ending, they are 2 different people, Arthur Fleck is dead and the Joker is born.Joaquin Phoenix brought the best of the Joker , from the unpredictability , the no regard for human life, and the villainous acts that brought the beginning of the clown prince of crime that makes him this deadly lethal villain, who we all know, we can be sure that Hamill , Ledger , Nicholson and Romero are proud of Joaquin.
This movie is 100% oscar worthy, and if Joaquin isn't winning it's a disgrace for the film industry.
Joker will be on my mind for a lot of time, there is a great message and like he said in the ending""what do u get when u cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you desrves"".
Thank U for every brilliant moment. I hope The jester of genocide is just starting. "
3904," Come, fall in love with him...
"," ""I just hope my death makes more sense than my life,"" the tormented Joker, Arthur Fleck confesses in his old journal. This psychological thriller, directed by Todd Phillips is based on the popular DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The origin of Joker dates back to 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who turns to a life of crime and commotion in Gotham City.<br/><br/>This movie got eight minutes standing ovation at Venice International Film Festival at the Premier of the movie, where it won a Golden Lion.<br/><br/>In very few mainstream movies, you fall in love with the negative character. This movie is one such and more so because it shows in great length, why the character turns dark; why he chooses the path he had chosen. Dark is a very carefully crafted word defined by movie makers and use it depending on what kind of audience they want to reach out to. The brutality in this movie is meant to shock you and it does the job immaculately.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck is a regular guy who is a clown by day and a stand-up comedian at night. But nobody laughs at his comic stuffs other than himself. He has a condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times.<br/><br/>In most of the joker movies, character is usually presented with bleached skins and hairs, warped mouth. This adaptation has nothing such rather the city he lives in is the inexorable silo.<br/><br/>Arthur sinks in the apathy of the fellow citizens to him. He is a victim of brutality and torment of fellow citizens of the city. The people around him are so wretched; they would queue to beat him up. Ignored in public, he would like to make people smile around him, whether by taking a gun to a children's hospital or by pestering his gorgeous black neighbour. On the other side, he is psychologically sick and socially ignored guy who would snap his mouth to an unsettling fake smile, or a sudden flip of eyes to look at the camera which would shake you. You would close your eyes in shock and dismay.<br/><br/>His improved self-confidence after the first attack shows in his elegant dance on the street. He finally fights back after the third attack and shoots the three bankers who attacked him inside the train. He admits, ""I killed those guys, because they were awful"".<br/><br/>After the subway shooting, an eyewitness draws an outline image of Arthur Fleck and there begins a movement. The subjugated people of Gotham rise up against the rich. Fleck became a cult star much to his amazement. The city is inundated by rebels in clown makeup and masks.<br/><br/>His mom, a poor woman writes letter to Thomas Wayne a business tycoon to help her out in their livelihood and somehow Arthur reads one of those letters, learns something very upsetting. He approaches Wayne from where he had to return shamed as usual. Completely flustered, he kills his mother.<br/><br/>His comedy show same night goes badly, as he laughs hysterically and finds difficulty delivering jokes. Talk show host Murray (Robert De Nero) mocks him by showing those clips on his show. He is invited to appear on Murray's show due to unanticipated popularity of that clip. Before the show goes live, Arthur requests Murray to introduce him as Joker with reference to his previous mockery. He walks in to a rousing welcome from the audience but begins telling gloomy jokes and admits of killing those three men in train, and rants about how society discards the oppressed and how he was mocked by Murray. Thereafter, he kills Murray live on television and is detained as riots break out all across Gotham. One of the rioters corners Thomas Wayne, kills him and his wife but leaves alone his son. Rioters also free Arthur Fleck from the police van and he dances to the cheers of the crowd and paints a smile on his face with his own blood when the movie draws to a close.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck's character isn't actually amusing as the name says, but it's gauche, the kind of fidgety, people shy away from in public because of his inconsistent behaviour. It's easy for the viewers to empathize with the character, his craving to be accepted. When he says he feels unseen or invisible, you can clearly realize why. He's the kind of person people would love to overlook out of apathy or uneasiness.<br/><br/>Joker is deliberately made dreadful, visually, and psychologically. The movie is grimmer and more distressing than other marvel movies. It gives the audience a power to believe from being powerlessness to powerful. It shows him dancing wildly in public, weeping alone by him when he is oppressed. It shows his sufferings, but at the end it has been shown what he went through was necessary to bring him the power and recognition that he deserved. "
3905," Spectacular Swamp
"," It's one of those huge, over wrought films chock full of great acting, sets, costumes, camera work, lighting. The whole nine yards carried by a murderous man discentigrating before our very eyes, brilliantly played by Phoenix.
Not for the faint hearted. Every second is nerve wracking.
All in the backdrop of New York City which has never looked so actively dingy. It is a world where there is no solace.
Robert DeNiro nailed his role as Johnny Carson style late night host.
Others in secondary characters carried their roles with clear, strong presences.
A must see if you are fascinated by the psychology of a human mind as it whirls &amp; flies apart. "

"," You should not listen to what anyone says, this movie is a mastepiece. Even now 5 hours after i watched the movie, i still get chills from all the moments in the film. The film does an excellent job at potraying arthurs life and his demise leading him to become the joker. This is not really a comic book movie, it is more a crime movie with certain elements of the batman lore that ties in (good) unexpected ways into the film. Now yes, this does have violence and some disturbing scenes but it is a R-rated film about the joker, if it did not, then the movie would be failure. Everyone reading this should watch the joker and you will even hours after seeing it, feel a shiver down your spine, I guarantee it. "

"," This film is a step in the right direction after the climax of the MCU, it's time for DC to create a new breed of comic book film as there's an infinite amount of possibilities with these charcters besides 12 rated action films with charming characters but overall dull stories that are just stepping stones for a big team up flick. This film manages to perfectly blend comic book material with plenty of subtle call backs that fans of the batman comics can catch. But doesn't rely entirely on it as its clear Todd Philips and Phoniex had there own story to tell and because of that what we are left with is a brilliant character analysis drama which has you hooked from start to finish. Besides perhaps a bit of a slow start, Joker was a ride from start to finish that made me leave the theater wanting to see it again as soon as possible. Support this film at all costs unless you want DC to make more films like Suicide Squad. "

Just because of this, this film is worth watching.<br/><br/>But is Joker because of that also the best DC Film ever produced? Simply no. It does of course come close to the most iconic ""The Dark Knight"", but there are just too many small plot holes and to many ""slow"" moments in this film to make it to the top.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. This movie is great. But there would be less point in watching it again, because it's just not that much entertaining for watching a second time. "

"," It is good, no doubt. It have great acting yeah. Oh and music was awesome. But what was the point really? I.e. of Joker running left and right in the last scene.
Oh I have no doubt that director would say that it was metaphor for something, like a Joker running wild or getting free in his violence or some other BS. I do not buy it.
And what was with the bullies kicking him when he was on the ground? Why? And doing this 2 times? ""Kick him harder!"" What the heck?
What was it with the Thomas Wayne punching Arthur in the nose? Why? I can't understand nor relate to that. Imagine quite a good guy, a father, businessman trying to be mayor to help people of the city. Why would you punch anybody in this situation? If not self defense every other scenario would be bad for you. Even if you would like to think of the PR after. And you do not make a fortune if you are stupid. I think more realistic would to say something 'you are crazy do not go near my family again' and walk out, right?
For me it was just to depict wealthy and powerful as evil just because they are wealthy and powerful, does not matter if they are evil or not. After all if Arthur mother was really delusional and he was not Wayne son then it means that real victims were Wayne family. Think about it. They employed mentally ill women, she adopted some child then deluded herself to have a child with her employer and when Wayne fired her, make her sign some papers most probably give her good amount of money to convince her not to running around saying that she have his child. I think it is pretty good trade for someone that troubled. After all some other guy beat her up and her adopted son chained to the heater... And after 30 years this child finds you in a toilet convinced that his is your child after terrifying you real child. 'Not this crazy women again' - though Wayne probably. And after that this crazy Joker-Clown revolution kills you and you wife and you son becomes orphan for a few bucks and pearl necklace because this 'not really your child' feels bad with his life after living with crazy mother and here abusive boyfriend. Can't say this is fair.
I am not living in USA but does 'wall street guys' do really ride trains and throws french fries on people? I can't say but seems highly unlikely.
Kinda whole picture seems to show rich people as bad because they have money.
Thinking about it, Joker was in center of this revolution of normal, working class people against wealthy and powerful ones... and we have Joker as a communist, modern Robin Hood type of character? Mentally ill, disfigured Robin Hood I might add. And Robin Hood who does not really care or want to be that and finally threat it is as a joke. I would threat it that also, because essentially this is stupid.
This Joker dance well... I kinda understand his delusion of hearing music. It is kinda Jokery. But at the same time it was kinda lame especially in the scene on the street after crash. Well angry mob is angry. What they want? Chaos probably. If Arthur with his mental illness thought that stupid, lame dance was good idea in his derange mind - to him probably it was. But not for angry mob - to them violently killing one of the policeman from crashed cop car probably would be more what they expect. And what you would expect from Joker really. True to be told I think that whole Joker/Clown revolution was kinda unrealistic. I don't believe it. One mad man do not start that kind of thing entirely by accident without any involvement.
Bruce character was really, really unnecessary IMO it like they would put him there just to show that it is really Gotham: 'oh look here! it is Batman! wink! wink!' But he does not do or say ANYTHING. Does it makes sense? No. You can argue that he was in shock when some thug killed his parents but this would makes more sense for him to shake his mather saying 'wake up mum' or something. But he was just standing there like statue. When Arthur put fingers in his mouth he also did not say or do anything. Really do you know 10 year old like that? It would be funny for him or he would not allow Arthur to do that because it is disgusting... or really something. I was like 'For god sake DO SOMETHING! ANYTHING!'. But no. It was like movie creators were aware that it is Joker movie not Batman movie so you cannot shift your emotion from Joker to sad lonely little boy so they make him a stone statue. Just in case.<br/><br/>It was kinda funny though. Arthur joke was funny because it was that much lame that it was funny.<br/><br/>I think it is good movie.
But in the same time I did not like it. "
3918," Breathtaking
"," Flawless performances, music, camerawork and script. Just full ten from me. Plot was simple, it focuses on the Arthur. Hes life and mental state. Everything else is just static around him, meaningless. If you pay close attention, you can see how surrounding world changes with Arthur's own life. True masterpiece. "

"," Just incredible Joaquin has made me fall in love with the joker! From the laugh to the absolute murderous person he becomes, through other people and the way society treats fellow human beings! Its relevant, its today...and I've always loved the guy...joker or no joker! The dedication, the passion, the cinema photography, hes always been on another level...but my God does this film make you feel and think, with masses of emotion! Hes just a fabulous human being! The stranger the better in my book! "
3926," Great movie!
"," I loved how dark this movie was, it was enjoyable from start to finish. Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job! "
3927," Masterpiece.
"," This is cinema, forget what the Oscars have to say. I won't even get into the comparing game between Joaquin Phoenixs's take on the Joker vs Heath Ledger's. This film is living proof that a comic book character and story can dive deep into the psychological aspects of the human mind, all while telling the story of how the human psyche can deteriorate due to unfortunate accounts and circumstances. The cinematography has excellent composition. The acting is out of this world.
The music is haunting, gloomy, and dark. I've never thought that comic book (adaptation) films are just for entertainment. I'm a firm believer that with good storytelling you can make any comic book character interesting, relatable, and serious. I also couldn't help but to get a nerd-gasm when the little kid said his name was Bruce, and his parents' murder at the end of the film. This is a must watch. "
3928," Joaquin is fantastic
"," Whether you are a fan of the joker or not, Joaquin certainly draws you in. His raw emotion and intensity in his acting grabs your attention immediately and you can't help but emphasise with him as the joker and feel his heart felt story.
A lot of people will try to compare him to Heath but both actors were absolutely amazing as the Joker. I thoroughly enjoyed this dark tale and look forward to more. "
3929," Legendary
", Joaquin Phoenix was born for this role. He's a legend. Music was great too. I have not seen a movie like this for years. I'm really impressed. 
3930," Fantastic
"," I would it another time for only the final part when he killed Murray.it's not like any another joker movie as it shows the origins of the joker and how Arthur became joker even if it is not related to comics but still fantastic and full of plot twists.
Enjoyed it much. "
3931," Not a superhero movie
"," If you are a kid waiting's to watch a graphic superhero movie so don't watch the movie.
It's an amazing movie for everything
Movie of the year "
3932," I watched this masterful thriller last weekend, and I've decided to make an IMDb account to show my appreciation for it as much as I can (also this review is spoiler free).
"," Gotham is a decaying and depressing city with Arthur trying to be a ray of sunshine in the darkness (he works as a clown for an entertainment company), but he is repeatedly mistreated and largely ignored by society, making him become increasingly aggressive even towards those he loves. He eventually becomes an icon of rebellion as he starts to become more and more relentless, eventually craving his newfound attention and fully embracing it. Many thought the character of this iconic villain was tainted by Jared Leto's performance in Suicide Squad, but this fully compensated it, Heath Ledger sure as hell would be glad about this. This film proves that sometimes it's lengthy character development that makes a better film than frequent action sequences and CGI. So by all means, believe me when I say that the hype is deserved, it's well worth your time ;). "
3933," Amazing movie.
"," I am just coming back from the cinema, so I'd like to express my opinion while still emotionally affected. That was a great introduction of Joker and amazing actor play by Joaquin Phoenix. At the end of the movie I felt like all Gotham pieces just got conneted. Great job. "
3934," Blown away
"," Wow. I need to go back and see this again. And Again. I struggle to remember an acting performance this riveting. Once is not so often, we stumble upon masterstrokes in acting performanceTom Hanks in Forrest Gump; Russel Crowe in A Beautiful Mind; Denzel Washington in Hurricane; Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady; J. K Simmons in Whiplash; Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder. I need to add Joaquim Phoenix in the Joker to this.
What he achieved here is telling what pop culture has asked for decades: how the Joker came to be. He did this so well, we may look at the character in a totally different light.
All other actors should start working on material for the 2021 Oscar best actor award. 2020's award's already taken. "
3935," Joker is the new age hero
"," 'For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do and people are starting to notice' - Joker
Joker is what we truly aspire to be but never really become. Joker embraced who he was and let his true dark instincts take over his once frail identity, arthur. Rise of Joker was inevitable as circumstances and fate demanded the negative force into existence. Arthur was really non existent in society until joker was born.
Im fascinated with themes such as anarchism, anti establishment, class differences and poverty. Another movie with a somewhat similar theme is V for Vendetta. Some scenes in this movie, the way it's shot has similarities with taxi driver, black swan and prisoners. I've now watched it thrice every consequtive day. Every frame is captivating, every scene is transforming, inspirational and thought provoking. And this can only occur if the creator and cast devote themselves to a deep character study of the protagonist. Issues such as mental illness, bullying and abuse are central to the films story without which there won't be any character development and as a result, no joker. I felt emotions so strong that words fail to describe how I feel. This movie was an immensely immersive and hypnotizing cinematic masterpiece, an experience that I will never forget. Engraved in my soul forver ! 'its beautiful' Jokes says while being taken in a police van to prison. Because after causing riots and anarchy across Gotham, joker realises causing chaos is such a wonderful feeling because that's the only world joker knows. Chaos, disorder and violence. And that's perfectly in harmony with joker as that's definitive of joker traits. No wonder he is agent of chaos. God of chaos ! "
3936," This is definitely the greatest Supervillian movie of all time.
"," If the king of good guy movies is Endgame, then Joker is the evil twin. Better than Deadpool, with a touch of Scorsese added in and a killer 70s and 80s soundtrack, this film tells the story of how Arthur Fleck, played by a skinny Joaquin Phoneix, meets up with a talk show host Kirk Franklin, played by Robert DeNiro, who wants to break big on national TV. His mother is dying and needs his help to take care of Bruce Wayne's dad, the son of which will become Batman and in the end one of Joker's pals kills Bruce's parents after they come back from a movie. Zazie Beets, fresh from Deadpool 2, is Joker's girlfriend. Some midgets play a great part as Joker's friends. The cinematography is amazing, the music great, and the pacing is slow yet enjoyable for a modestly budget movie that is being advertised in some theatres as an arthouse movie yet it's making a lot of money. Go see this movie while it's in theaters so that it get some awards love next year. Ha ha ha ha ha ha... "
3937," Joaquin Phoenix, Wow!!
"," First time ive ever reviewed a movie and this is deserving of my first, Joker was gritty, dark, intense and i absolutely loved it! His life was in fact a tragedy that in the end he saw as a comedy and that itself is heartbreaking to me, and as he got knocked further down by the world and people and events happening around him and descended more and more into madness it was quite sad to see him become Joker which i thought was powerful , but  his acting was incredible, the standard was ridiculous it even made me emotional marvelling at how insanely good he was on screen. Joaquin will win best actor at the 2020 Oscars, as nothing comes close to me in years. Todd Phillips shot a beautiful movie to look at, sleazy and grounded in realism so fair play to a guy no one beforehand believed he could pull this off with the announcement he was directing. And to top it off the score was beautiful and menacing. 9/10 for the film 10/10 for Joaquins performance, cant wait to see it again, And please no sequel it isnt needed atall! "
3938," Such a masterpiece is pisses me off!
"," This is the film every aspiring actor and director who have had a hard life full of struggle and depression dream of creating. It's a film you only dream of being apart of to show the full range of emotions possible, and to expose the truths of how dark the world is to kind gentle people. It pisses me off I couldn't have been the star of this perfect film to fully let loose all the pain I have buried inside as an aspiring actor, and be cemented in cinema history. Bravo Todd Philips for creating the perfect film! "
3939," Joker.....the hero?
"," After paying 600pkr (¬£3.30) for a ticket I went into it thinking 9/10 IMDB pffft yeah right, like I've watched so many good films it's gotta be absolutely amazing for it to be added to that list because I just didn't know how they would pull it off and that aswell with no like build up such as a batman film before, not in the DCEU or anything else it was just a stand alone movie<br/><br/>Then whilst watching it, it was so unpredictable that I was just constantly thinking wtf why am I enjoying this so much then I realised his acting (and the score omffgggg) just takes you on a rollercoaster that by the end of it your on his side and cheering him on like he's the hero<br/><br/>There where 1 or 2 bits I didn't like but overall one of the best movies I've seen<br/><br/>In my opinion "
3940," Don't listen to the Fake media or the critics.
"," Truly captivating, however the Critics and Media still want to make this movie/character look terrible to push their own agendas. Meanwhile there is a real lesson behind it. Society is twisted and wants to make those who aren't in their mindset look crazy or ""weird"". 10/10 movie. Went to see it a second time "

It's give way too much negative energy that I can't take it but it's had a special magic that will lure you to see this wonderful act again. can feel pain,helpless, sadness in his laughter that bring u chill in every part of your bones.It's send a powerful message that Everyone can become a joker if the environment betray and don't accept them. the world will be a better place if we shown some love and patience
to those have trouble expressing themself.
I totally love this movie. "
3944," The True Meaning of A Masterpiece
",
3945," Great job but there is a crucial missing
"," First of all, I saw it for the second time yesterday just to be sure about my thoughts and yes I was much more brutal about something in the movie but I feel a bit different now.<br/><br/>Excellent cinematography, great sceneography and splendid acting by Joaquin Phoenix YET I found some element missing. Let me first make it clear. I don't really know about DC world and the stories and for this case Batman. I chose to see this movie as a completely different world than Joker from DC. So here we have a man who is having psychological problems and goes crazy after what happened to him lately. Don't get me wrong. Movie is great overall but there is this problem I'll write about and it makes the movie ''not enough'' I'd say. Some people complain about how different this joker than the other joker(like its not like a comic thing) and it seems like similar compositions with ''Taxi Driver'' or ''King Of Comedy'' make some people ''oh its so same so its bad...''.  However, these or other things that most people are talking about are not my point breakers at all.<br/><br/>So what are the problems?<br/><br/>The problem is lack of incidents for Joker to become Joker and plot it self. For those who don't know much about technical side of the screenwriting, your protagonist should be likeable or at least able to make the audience feel empathy for him/her. Even we feel connected to bad characters sometimes. Please note that, I am not supporting the idea of everything should be done by some strict rules in cinema like I gave the example of character building but apparently it is not so successfully done in this movie. I am getting the point. Obviously joker went through something even before the movie starts and we get to see him suffer after the movie starts. He gets beaten a couple of times, tries to be a comedian and fails and discovers that he is adopted and his favorite tv show man makes fun of him for his sickness ect. In that sense, the question here is: Did we feel for joker? The answer is maybe yes but believe me it was not enough. At least not enough to become a symbol for the city and start a riot. I mean camo'n... He kills three rich men, and police suspects someone dressed like a clown. So this triggers poor people to rebel with clown masks? I know there is an unemployment problem and they are going through an election, people are ready to explode already but it just still does not persuade me. The very first thing triggers his becoming Joker process happens in the beginning in the train. Especially the last scene where they save joker from the police car. Joker did't feel powerful enough to make lots of people save him and put him in a leader chair. No, he did not! I just pity him for what happened to him and thats all. There must be something bigger than that.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't give enough reason in terms of making audience feel enough for the protagonist to change so that we actually can believe he may lead something but this did not happen. Also, 8 stars is for what i said in the beginning. Everything other than that done so well that nearly makes me forget the fact that i mentioned about. I just wish the plot was a little more intense for joker.<br/><br/>All in all, still, it was enjoyable to watch thanks to great visual storytelling. Great job by Todd Phillips and his cinematographer Lawrence Sher. They did comedy before and i really was amazed how they pulled that drama off. I liked some details like the part where the rich people watch Modern Times and enjoy it which is really critically done. You see, film is overall great but plot could've done better for joker's change in my opinion. Also what the hell is wrong with people saying ''It was the best movie ever''. This movie is a true piece of art but for god's sake don't make it overrated.So good with some crucial missings "
3946," There is more than enough stuff to watch this at least once, so go check it out if you want!
"," I thought that the movie was shot really well, the colours and the digital look really made it gritty and it fits the story it's telling. There are some aspects of the story that I liked but there is a lot of things untouched, and a lot of just dumb stuff.<br/><br/>Phoenix really deserves an Oscar Nomination at the very least, but for me the whole character of the Joker is still better in the Dark Knight than this. Phoenix fits for this one. Ledger was fitting for that one.<br/><br/>Directing-wise there was a lot of creative shots and sequences but overall it didn't blow me away, but the score was so unsettling and well used that I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The sound editing was also really slick too.<br/><br/>Every other main performance was good too.<br/><br/>It's really well paced.
But some parts are really predictable and a lot of things have no shock value at all.<br/><br/>My biggest issues are the story and the overall themes and messages of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't wanna go in-depth with the plot because I could do it all night long, but the themes and messages are either really sick, or just non-existant. I guess nihilism and mental illnes both play an important part but I can't find any actual human thing other than those.<br/><br/>Maybe a bit about popularity and meaning of people and money.<br/><br/>but....
SPOILER
The whole thing with the Wayne Family, especially the end scene was soo forced. It really didn't have to be there and it made me think about the businessmen rather than the actual characters. "
3947," The best performance I have ever witnessed on screen
",
3948," Great and deep!
"," It's amazing how the film sequence goes so well, the great director's work makes you put into joker's life and how he sees the society and the world. This couldn't be possible without Phoenix's performance, its an amazing job than I haven't seen in a while. This movie can makes you feel sad at the end because you can understand a little part of how this kind of psychiatric persons may feel, and how the society ignore them. I've never had that feeling like that. "
3949," Deserves all the Oscars.
",
3950," Loner Murder Fantasy
"," When I heard about the fears about the possibility of violence at the opening of this movie, I thought ""there's no way it's actually as much as a wet dream as people think it is."" Welp, it is.<br/><br/>Arthur has no redeeming qualities. Taking care of your mom and weirdly bathing her does not a relatable character make. His ""descent in to madness"" is shallow because he was there the whole time - his psychosis/hallucinations were not new given that he had already been institutionalized before the events of the movie. Arthur's pain is used to justify his atrocities and with no redeeming qualities it is kind of gross at how many people see him as a ""relatable"" character.<br/><br/>Turns out the guy who thinks PC culture is ruining comedy still thinks it's funny to make fun of little people. Shocking.<br/><br/>If you want better depictions of mental illness then watch Netflix's Maniac or Amazon's Undone. "
3951," A Sublime experience that I can't make sense of
"," Today an entire theatre was silenced. Well mostly, I mean commenting is unavoidable in a hall. But yeah. At one point my jaw was literally hanging open for a fairly long period. I was entirely aware of it but was compelled to keep it open, because I couldn't shut it willingly.<br/><br/>That's not an everyday experience, especially being desensitized by the constant consumption of media. And as a Joker fan I thought I knew him, that I'd seen it all. That his mind was as familiar as a well read book. I don't mean he's predictable, after all the Joker is well known for upsetting expectations. Rather, certain actions fit the Joker psychologically. So when he pulls one of his characteristic moves you're like, ah yes, a classic Joker. But the Joker had to, well, pull a Joker on us all. Because I saw none of that coming. There were these moments where I'd stare at the screen saying to myself, did I see what I just saw? What did I just see?<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I was left feeling simultaneously discombobulated and yet Sublime. I can't explain it, what it is or why it is, but I feel amazed at seeing something amazing. Usually I'm articulate enough to come up with some reason as to why something made me feel a certain way. In this case I've got nothing. I think I need to see the film again just to figure out my exact opinions. Or maybe I won't have an exact opinion. Maybe that is the point of the movie, that not everything can be labeled neatly. That sometimes you can only enjoy the chaos.<br/><br/>Rarely there are these gems of comic book movies that transcend the norms. That offer a unique and transcendental experience. Logan and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse are one of those few and Joker has joined their ranks. Congrats to DC.<br/><br/>Update: I totally recommend watching this movie alongside Inception. I feel like these films speak to each other. "
3952," Prequel to Ledgers Joker
",
3953," Wow
"," What a movie, the Joker is now among my top 3 of all time. This will go down as a Classic Masterpiece. "
3954," Masked Mirroring
"," ""Joker"" is a controversial picture, although I suspect some of the political criticisms and, more so, the fearmongering over the threat of life imitating art will die down in time, and the latter is surely fueled largely by memories of the Aurora, Colorado shooting during a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) and, due to this movie's similarity to ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), the history of John Hinckley Jr. taking inspiration from Martin Scorsese's film in his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Otherwise, the divisiveness, in a way, suits an origin story of Batman's psychopathic and sadistic arch nemesis. He's not a hero; he's the clown prince of crime. Despite the uproar, there's nothing especially groundbreaking about ""Joker."" It's a darker and more realistic and serious comic-book movie in the tradition of the Dark Knight trilogy, ""Logan"" (2017), or some of Zack Snyder's superhero adaptations (i.e. not ""Justice League"" (2017)). Other supervillain origin stories have followed different well-trodden paths: ""Venom"" (2018) is the usual mostly-bloodless and CGI-intoxicated light treatment, as most successfully branded by the MCU; ""Split"" (2016) and ""Brightburn"" (2019) are part of the horror genre; and ""Suicide Squad"" (2016) is garbage. It's all been done before. The novelty of ""Joker,"" then, is that it doesn't feature the usual dual narrative (also common of musicals such as the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film ""Shall We Dance"" (1937) that Arthur Fleck watches on TV in one scene) of superhero and supervillain, although a young Bruce Wayne is an ancillary character here, or the focus on an entire team of superheroes as in the other dark comic-book features.<br/><br/>While some commenters seem to forget the basis of ""Joker"" in that respect, every critic worth their salt has mentioned--and often denounced as derivative--the picture's debt to the films of Scorsese, namely ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"" (1983). Most films are derivative, although I suppose ""Joker"" goes further with its mirroring those films' storylines and themes than, say, the general genre borrowings of the Dark Knight trilogy with film noir or ""Logan"" and the Western. As in Scorsese's films, the protagonist here is a mentally-ill loner with a precarious grip on reality. Like Travis Bickle, Fleck goes on a killing spree amid a political election (in this case, Bruce Wayne's father running for Gotham mayor on the Ayn Rand plutocracy ticket). And, like Rupert Pupkin, he's an aspiring and unsuccessful stand-up comedian and avid follower of a late-night TV talk show--including, inevitably, confronting the show's host. Much has been made, justifiably, of Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which compliments nicely as a character study to the more symbolic role, of a Joker without origins, inhabited by Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Perhaps, not enough has been said, however, of the perfect casting here of Robert De Niro. Obviously, the Joker can and has been portrayed well by different actors (and not so well by still others), but the part of Murray Franklin, the talk-show host, wouldn't work with anyone besides De Niro. The homage to the Scorsese films and De Niro's parts in them as Bickle and Pupkin would be lost otherwise.<br/><br/>""Joker"" also reminds me a bit of ""Fight Club"" (1999) in its ""mind-game"" film-type shifts between fantasy and reality, with an inversion of the delusion over a romantic relationship. Both pictures also feature violent, populist retribution being taken upon society by mostly, if not all, white men, although ""Joker,"" like most mainstream fare, is intentionally too ambiguous to pin down a coherent socio-political message. Is Thomas Wayne's labelling some people ""clowns"" reminiscent of Hillary Clinton's ""deplorables"" remarks? Does it recall fellow-proclaimed-billionaire Donald Trump's habits of name calling or his involvement in the so-called ""Central Park Five"" case and the term of ""super-predator"" employed in the 1990s? Does it matter? The Joker even insists that he has no political views--right before he begins a diatribe on those very views. He's an agent of anarchy and chaos, as was Ledger's iteration. His killing spree is born of self-defence and expands to filling the void in his life left by no romantic love, no friends, lack of social services and medical attention, professional setbacks, mommy issues and daddy issues, repeated abuses, and his socially-stigmatizing involuntary laughter.<br/><br/>Stylistically, ""Joker"" seems derivative, too, in the gritty look of a mid-budget arthouse production and shaky camera focus on the disturbed head of its protagonist. The Gotham here is decidedly a reflection of 1970s-1980s New York. I'm more interested in the cinematic self-reflexivity, though. The frequent shots of Joker looking in mirrors reinforces the character's psychology, but mirrors may also be considered as analogues to motion pictures, which likewise captures images and reflects them back to us. Ditto the fantasy-reality dichotomy in a movie that aims for realism in the superhero genre dominated by fantasy--and within an art form that already is arguably both objective recorder of reality and instrument of illusion making. The mirror motif is especially apt for a movie that conspicuously imitates other movies and which features films-within-the-film. Besides the Astaire-Rogers musical, the Joker's dancing also reflects back upon Charlie Chaplin's silent masterpiece of the Great Depression, ""Modern Times"" (1936)--specifically, the roller-skating sequence. It's ironic, too, that while Joker sneaks into the theatre, in the guise of an employee, the wealthy Waynes sit in prized seats for the Tramp's, the most famous clown of the silent era, comedic social commentary on economic inequality. The other apt film reference here is one that has apparently been around in Batman lore for a while now, which is to Zorro films. Douglas Fairbanks basically became the first film superhero when he put on the mask and began swashbuckling in ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1920). For the early '80s setting of ""Joker,"" the showing the Wayne family exits on that fateful night this time is ""Zorro, The Gay Blade"" (1981).<br/><br/>To top if off, this is the most performative Joker yet. He's always been disguised as a clown, which suggest performance, but here he's employed as one. Moreover, he aims to be a stand-up comedian, and he appears as a talk-show guest on TV after spending most of the movie as mere spectator to the boob tube. His killing of three yuppies also inspires others to wear clown masks and, eventually, to make performance art into a riot. Sure, ""Joker"" is disturbingly violent art, but art nonetheless. "
3955," Very Good
",
3956," Brilliant
",
3957," Delightfully disturbed
"," As a frequent movie goer and fellow performer I would just like to say first off I am thoroughly impressed. The entirety of this film was extremely depressing. Any sliver of happiness that Arthur gets, seems to just get extracted viciously out of his life. You watch his slow decent into madness and you're clenching onto your seat to see what he might do next; whether that is killing ruthlessly, or creating fake relationships in his twisted mind. Joaquin Phoenix depicts the perfect battle between good and evil with his constant struggle between happiness and sadness. In the end I was honestly routing for the joker because of the pain manifested through his whole life. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me see things differently about society. Everyone is a little mad. 10/10 "
3958," Joker- School Project
"," Walking into this film I didn't know much about the story or the actor, I had hear great things about Joaquin Phoenix and his movies but I had never experienced it. I was told countless times there would be incredible amounts of violence and when I walked in he barely killed or hurt anyone. Although you only see five deaths six are implied, but the most damage was to himself and the psychological doing the world had done to him. I had felt a deep sorrow for Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) because it shows society failing as a unit. The was no one helped him, he felt alone and trapped, doctors were failing, his mother was crazy, and no one bothered to care. Joker had started a revolution without saying a word. As a viewer we are told not to feel remorse or sympathy for any villain because it is their choosing this was not the case, no wonder a man went insane. The way Joaquin Phoenix presented himself was incredible 10/10. The story line really showed the darkness of the world and the crazy 10/10. This movies was incredible I recommend it to anyone and everyone. A good movie for me gives me a connection and I felt this throughout the entire film. "
3959," Stunning, haunting performance
"," Despite all the bad press the left leaning political left gave this movie ( I used to lean left( now neutral)... This movie was simply stunning! Joaquin Phoenix puts blood and sweat into this role. The director crafts the movie like a piece of fine art. Despite the triumph of Endgame earlier in the year, in comparison,Endgame seemed like a wonderful day at a themepark whereas Joker was deeply impactful, thought-provoking and stunningly masterful.<br/><br/>If the paid media isn't careful by reviewing entertainment according to poltical leanings instead of reviewing movies at thier own merit ,they will render themselves irrelevant. This movie put a stamp as memorable as Heath Ledgers take, of Batman's arch nemesis. "
3960," Great Alternate Origin Story
"," As one of the better known comic book character villains, this film makes for an interesting alternate of an origin story compared to the multitudes of others about the Joker. Phoenix commits to the role playing a realistic mentally ill/traumatized socially isolated character. Inevitably the conclusion is known from the start, ergo becoming the Joker, but the journey was interesting nevertheless. "
3961," Great Backstory
"," Just saw it after reading mixed reviews. I will say that this was an outstanding back story, set in a real life type scenario. Not a very comic book feel, but still seemed to hold truths with the Batman storyline. I'm no Batman expert, but I say the performance was just how it was supposed to be and this movie provided some very cool scenes with an interesting music score. Great ""How he came to be""
It's good and worth the money to see in the theater. "
3962," The best movie that I'll never watch again
"," We could be looking at a second best actor award for a Joker actor.

3968," It was not about comics villain, it was all about reality
"," In the past, almost every movie taught us to support character who was kind and who everybody loved. The other one who killed people and made something bad, oh, screw him, he should be punished, no one cared about evil character. But wait, don't we remember that life doesn't work this way? There is no sharp line between dark and bright side, there is no absolutely bad and absolutely good in people. And that 'kind guy' is the worst one is someone's story.<br/><br/>Joaquin's joker is the brilliant example of it. Despite from other jokers, this one is real. He lives in every person who is permanent victim of society, bulling and indifference. This joker shows us the blindness of ours. Yes we support the cowards like Thomas wayne and don't think maybe how many lives we have ruined with our rudeness and injustice.<br/><br/>Everyone who joker killed deserved it.<br/><br/>The only reason of my 9 is the last scene. It has no meaning, movie should end with making a bloody smile on face. The glory of Joker and the Defeat of blind, stupid, arrogant and indifferent bustards.<br/><br/>What about Joaquin, he makes me wordless!!! "
3969," Jokers Origin - a very good origin story.
"," For those that aren't aware ... this is not a big comic book action film CGI fest... enjoy the story you are being told, the emotions are there.
As a stand alone film, it's brilliant, for those that want references to you know who, it's has slim pickings and that's how it should be, this story is not about him. I did want a little more madness in regards to Joker kicking off but I think that's because of the hype the fainthearted have created. I've read people feeling uncomfortable and it's so violent. I think there's two moments of violence, that were acted out very well. You get pulled in, waiting to see where the story will take you.
It's a very good portrayal as origin for the Joker, great acting and story line. You can end up with a number of interpretations to this movie. If you already know background and interpretations of Jokers origin, be it comics, animated, big screen previous, you will enjoy this for sure. "

3971," Not since the Jungle Book.
"," Haven't watched a movie since The Jungle Book. Which I enjoyed because it's a great story. Today I watched Joker. This is a true movie without the fantastic unbelievable BS hero stuff. There's no heroes here. Just a egoistic society void of god and angels. Virtue is at a bargain price if it exists at all. One leaves this movie wanting to deny three times that they belong to this species. The performance is worth twice the admission. It may be another 5 years before the next movie I go out to see, but I sure make it the good ones. "

The most bitter fans of the bat will love the interpretation of Phoenix by the amazing and realistic interpretation of an ""entity ""plunged into the most absolute devastation, channeler of chaos, anger and evil that happens to our world. His genesis, his smile give us back the cognitive dissonance between the real and the impossible: a set of mirrors that point directly to the viewer as the maker of the king of chaos, and it is in that same Bertoltbrechtian game, where we become partners of the vehement viscerality of an interpretation and drama that implode and give birth to chaos in the form of Joker.<br/><br/>Throughout the history of cinema there have been dazzling interpretations; What Phoenix has achieved will blind us in a breath of heartbreaking darkness without knowing very well whether to laugh or cry.<br/><br/>Work of instant worship.

"," Joaquin Phoenix delivers a perfect representation of the clown prince of crime in this absolutely phenomenal film. Todd Phillips did an excellent job in the writing and direction of the film and the sound track is also one of the best I've seen for a long time. This is by far my favourite movie of all time and I do think it will age well despite the controversy over its depictions of violence which help demonstrate the capabilities of such a twisted character. I would certainly suggest this film even if you are not a comic movie fan since this really departs from the flashy antics we are used to and narrows in on the nitty, gritty details of such an infamous character, giving us a realistic, in depth study on a mentally ill person.

3991," New Era of comic based movie
", Movie is awesome as it develops character of Joker and downward spiral because of society. 
3992," Uncomfortable
"," If I were to use one word to describe this film, it would be uncomfortable. This is great, since it's clear this is exactly what this film feels like it's trying to do. That said, the soundtrack was great, and fit the tone really well, all performances hit the bar for me. That said, it's still not a perfect film. For one, I think the film should have ended in the streets during the scene on the police car instead of in the prison, leaving the impression that the joker os free. Also, if the makeup of the joker could change over time to look more and more like Heath Ledger. I guess this kinda happened when he spread the blood across his cheeks, but this could have had a lot more weight to it if his makeup changed over time with the character. Overall, highly recommended. "
3993," a solo show for phoenix where King of Comedy meets V for Vendetta
"," Ill make this short. Phoenix as absolutely oscar worthy. If you like this film, go watch taxi driver, king of comedy and v for vendetta. slight complaints: the film stays a bit too much on phoenix, 15 minutes could have been cut or used for telling a more sophisticated story about the social uprise and other characters involved. but this is a solo show of a narcist character (a poor mans trump if you so will). Very strong that warner and DC went down the road to decipher the wayne clan as a bourgeois parasite of society. It was about time to tell the story about social injustices and bring this theme into the superhero cinema. this is a film for people that hate superhero movies, a masterfull deconstruction. "

Saya rasa dia belum all out memerankan Joker, timeline-nya sebagai Joker saat dia dengan make up Joker masih kurang menurut saya. Saya ingin melihatnya lagi sebagai Joker.<br/><br/>SPOILER
Biarpun saya merasa kurang dengan perannya, tapi Scene yang paling saya suka adalah saat dia berbicara dengan Murray itu sangat menunjukannya bagaiman Joker dengan Mental Disorder yang terkontrol.<br/><br/>Thanks. "

It very brutal, unsettling, very dark and one of best of Joaquin Phoenix performance as the Joker. I'm so happy that they made Joker that is great like Dark Knight But even DARKER!<br/><br/>10/10 "

", A really magnificent piece of art with an incredible and deep scenes and thoughts. You won't see a better scenario for Joker than this one. 
4004," Masterful study of the descent into evil

4005," Awesome movie
"," Didn't go with high expectations and was literally impressed by the feelings that this movie shows. Depending on the person, some may feel depressed after this movie or some could feel for the Joker and what is happening in the world. Recommend this movie to everyone to see. "

4010," OUTSTANDING!!!
", How can we start from the very beginning I was locked in hooked and eyes stuck to the screen shivers down my spine and hairs raising on my arms and legs what a sensational performance from phoenix the manor of his approach attention to detail was to the T the story line was so focused and crisp just a outstanding film with not a single error this will be added to my film collection and if heath ledger could see this he would be proud. 
4011," Joker is like it should be
"," If you expect a movie which focusses on action than this might not be for you... if you want a very clear view on how a mentally stressed and by society totally disgarded man becomes a total psycho you should totally see this movie. When Fleck stops getting the help he clearly needs and everything he knew and ""loved"" is a total lie and killed some people in the proces he plans to makes one final plan to show the world his distress... killing himself on national television; however... when he gets interrupted by the host he choses for an other option which makes his transformation to ""Joker"" complete. The film is disturbingly showing (in a very good way imo) how the (higher) society itself is partially responsible for the creation of psychopaths like Fleck and therefore the violence that occurs is reviewed by many as too harshly while a lot of other movies that are drenched with it come away with it. The violence is not that hard but because it is placed on exactly the right places it creates the shivers that the makers wants us to get. It is a movie that should get a lot of oscars especially for Joaquin who did a more than excellent job portraying the prince of darkness. "
4012," Definitely the best acting in 2019
"," I still haven't decided how to rate the film, I need some time to think, maybe rewatch the movie several times.<br/><br/>However, I'm sure how to rate Joaquin Phoenix's acting: it's 10/10, exceptional performance, the best that I've seen this year. "
4013," One of masterpiece movie

Timeless movie, great in every way. "

4015," Masterpiece
"," Don't read any reviews, all of the critics just want to be clever about this movie and then fail. This is a masterpiece. One you don't get to see too often these days. See it for yourself. "
4016," From beginning to end - one of the best DC movies and one of the best movies overall I have seen
"," From start to finish this movie gripped me, the direction, pace, acting, production, costumes, dialogue.... done to PER-FLECK-TION!! (See what I done there)<br/><br/>Brutal yet honest this depiction of the Joker has left me wondering ""if this was by far the best portrayal of the joker, who could possibly do better?"" - well I asked the same thing with Heath Ledger's Joker and it looks like I have my final answer. This was deep and it felt like there was an underlining message about mental health issues and our governments blind eye turning that leads to the final result.<br/><br/>This film is worthy of an Oscar in all departments especially for Joaquin Phoenix. Please dont take my word for it, go and see this movie as soon as. I feel a renewed faith in DC IF they go along a similar path as they have with this.<br/><br/>How have some critics played this movie down so much is beyond me! "
4017," A masterpiece of cinema.

", Amazing movie and the interpretation of Joaquin is absolutely stunning. 10/10 
4023," 9 because I was hyped
"," It's not the masterpiece like all the people saying, I was little bit disappointed because it's not upto the hype. "
4024," Cinematic Classic! Heath Ledger would be Proud of This.
"," This is an incredible achievement. It has the much needed depth for modern day movies and is equally gripping. The origin of Joker is as poignant as the origin of Batman himself. The seemingly unsmiling Batman who wants order does need, and indeed does depend on the equally mighty force of laughter and chaos that comes to be the Joker. The descent into disorder, the hatred of the successful, etc. is all seamless. I am truly glad that this movie held on to its darker tones as it is, after all, a dark Batman and Joker story. Order and Chaos. Bring it on. I do sincerely hope that they continue with this storyline and we see more of this intense stuff. 10/10 from me. Not 9. Not 9.9 but a full 10 out of 10. "
4025," Amazing
", One of the best films I've seen in a long long while.<br/><br/>I will even say... probably better than Heath Ledger's Joker.<br/><br/>Don't believe some of the negative reviews; they're just trying to grab some attention. 
4026," Absolutely nailed it.
"," I do not prefer to make a comparison to previous representations of the character.
My focus is here that this time they nailed it. This is how and adaptation and interpretation of story and character should have been. "
4027," Acting, Cinematography and Sound Perfection
"," A masterful performance by Phoenix that protrays the Joker perfectly. The movie takes us on a journey inside the head of the Joker and we see the character evolve into the Joker as played by Ledger.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound work so well together, this film deserves oscars! "
4028," Insanity nurtured!
"," This was a pure genius showing of the Joker (Arthur Fleck), in a very human light. A deep betrayal of nurture rather than nature. Someone who has been abused since childhood and this abuse carries on well in to his present life. A story of insanity by the product of a society with a twisted perspective. Joaquin Pheonix's performance was perfection and well worth a few awards. A brilliant take on the character Joker and well worth a watch. "
4029," Perfect way to show the story and make people reflection
"," I feel scared after seeing this movie since it's so vivid. I think it's very important for a country to make sure the right for people. If one person feel desperate, he or she may be crazy. Perfect way to present this story, it deserves high grade. "

4038," DC made a great film
", There have been many movies of DC but none of them put upto the mark. Recent movies were kinda flop but this movie was a great comeback. Overall i liked this movie. 
4039," A truly sensational depiction.
"," Joker is a truly sensational dive into the back story of the Joker. A twisted look into his dark descent on the road to becoming the Joker. The character development is sublime with Pheonix playing an absolutely incredible version of the joker, matching his twisted insanity with scarily accurate acting. This is the back story the Joker really needed, away from all the CGI rubbish, and in with deep and dark story telling that keeps you on the edge of your seat! I also love the way a young Bruce Wayne was introduced, leading to the excitement of a potential sequel or appearance in the next Batman movie. The ending was also very very good and depicts how he became a legend amongst Gothams darkest. "
4040," The Joker Struggles in the 'Real' World in a Powerful Re-imagining
"," JOKER was an engaging, fascinating and intense diversion from the bravado of current 'super hero' movies from DC. A gritty, character driven piece of up close and personal filming centred around one character and his transformation into the cult villain. The Joker was very much in the 'real' world as he struggles with issues around mental health, social care budgets and the cult of celebrity. There were many poignant moments as the Joker tries to find his voice in an indifferent society.<br/><br/>It was also a comment on the power of television and how one person can rise to represent an underlying tide of discontent in society. The music was powerful, filling the scenes with additional pressure as the character teeters on the edge of sanity and building 'Taxi Driver' like to an explosive end. The timeline was a little wayward but felt there was enough of a nod to the other Batman films to tie it in to the DC Universe. A feast on many levels. "
4041," THIS IS MAGIC !!!
"," Can't stop myself from talking about this one......#no_spoilers<br/><br/>Dark as hell, Joker takes u through the disturbing journey of Arthur Fleck, from being a clown &amp; a wanna be stand- up comedian (with only one joke in his hand.....his life) to become THE ""JOKER""......this journey never looked unreal though, unlike that of a hulk or a spider man....as this journey was quite human, logical and beautifully graphed and captured(of course) !!!<br/><br/>Heath Ledger from the 'Dark Knight' was my personal favourite joker till date &amp; Joaquin Phoenix took the legacy of Heath to another level altogether.....that laugh, that dance, that sprint, that walk....uff....can't get over that !!!<br/><br/>Talking about the other aspects of the movie....the background music was the soul of the movie, if not the psyche and the madness of joker itself,,,,,the cinematography, the supporting cast, the direction...everything thing was right on money , the movie very smartly dealt with the then situation of America (the Gotham city),,,,,the unemployment, the raising power in the hands of the rich....all it took was a stand and a voice (be it good or bad) against the established power to become the 'HERO'...which further became the reason of the rise in murders &amp; crime in the city !!!<br/><br/>In his small appearance, the legend Robert De Niro was exceptionally awesome, something that u would expect from him everytime u see him on the screen.....that small conversation at the end btwn joker and De Niro was cinematic beauty and looked damn organic....an absolute treat to watch !!!<br/><br/>Don't know about the oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years &amp; in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that i have seen...was that of Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'.....Phoenix was right up there too if not above, not only the craziness, disturbance and madness but also the physical transformation was quite commendable.<br/><br/>!! IF HEATH HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR THE JOKER THEN I WOULD SAY PHOENIX HAS GIVEN A LIFE TO THE JOKER !!<br/><br/>My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,""I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY""....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!<br/><br/>It has got those 'Dark Knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes...i had an emotional ride, watching small Bruce Wane (Nolan's batman) meeting Joker, getting to know the pre batman story of the Gotham city and the back story or the building-up of the 'Joker the villain' of dark night.....IT WAS QUITE NOSTALGIC FOR ME IN THAT WAY !!!<br/><br/>If i would have maximum of 5 stars to give to this movie, i would have simply divided it by zero (0).....i write about movies all the time but this one has that 'something' that forced me to type and share my views with u guys instead of writing it in my diary.....on that note i would like to finish this review with one line....""THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT I SAW....&amp; U CAN'T CAN'T CAN'T MISS IT"" !!!<br/><br/>#JOKER_2019‚ù§‚ù§<br/><br/>'ALL IT TAKES IS ONE BAD DAY'-JOKERüòâüòõüòÇ "

Absolutely amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix.He has portrayed the character so brilliantly,somehow evoking our sympathy for a psychotic homicidal clown. Todd Philips and Phoenix somehow makes us feel sad of the Joker but also makes us scared of him. The movie has an uncomfortable feel to it with amazing cinematography and a beautiful score. Every time the score starts to play you know somethings about to happen but you don't know what. The ending is amazing and somehow makes you feel satisfied but also uncomfortable that you feel that way. The movie portrays a grim but realistic world and how far a person like Arthur Fleck can be hurt before he starts to fight back.Amazing plot, amazing acting,amazing directing job and overall an amazing movie.10/10 with a cherry on top "

4047," Relentlessly disturbing masterpiece
"," I created an account just to review this. I saw it twice in the space of 3 days. This move is truly a masterpiece, in every way - the acting, story, cinematography, music, everything comes together in a more than the sum of its parts kind of way. There's a little bit of magic here, I don't think anyone can purposely create something this good, they can try, but only sometimes does it all come together like this.<br/><br/>The second viewing was just as good as the first. The tension was the same, it was just as disturbing, and the time still flew by just as quickly. And as someone who grew up on a steady diet of batman and joker comics, this is a perfect version of the Joker's origin, and I loved how it tied in batman's origin too, that was an inspired way to link them together.<br/><br/>The ambiguities and layers in the film were clearer on second viewing, and even keep coming days later... besides all of the ones I've seen discussed such as weather TW is his father, or which other scenes may not have happened... we also don't actually know if Arthur already had a history of violence, nor do we know if or how much the medication is what was making him so docile and timid. His journal has much more dark stuff in than we see. He is actually quite belligerent and disconnected even in the beginning of the movie. Etc. There is a LOT going on in this movie.<br/><br/>I could gush on for hours. It is a work of art. "

The movie is intense and touches a lot of important topics: battle with mental illnesses, the war between the rich and the poor, injustice, lack of empathy, etc. When life is so bad that the villain becomes the hero and a leader of a movement. A very tragic, thought provoking story that leaves you with many questions about the world we live in. "

4061," Great film, a character study with masterful perfomance from Pheonix. Not a totally comfortable film to watch but that makes it more of a masterpiece
"," Great film, if uncomfortable to watch in parts. This is not a comic book film. It's a character study of a severely mentally ill person, Arthur Flek, who seems to be living under a permanently dark cloud as life dumps on him from every angle even when he's trying to act positively. His mother had always told him to put on a happy face and bring joy and laughter to the world. Even to the extent of calling him Happy. He also has a condition where he uncontrollably breaks into laughter. However inside he is all negative thoughts and this is tearing him apart, even his therapist won't listen.<br/><br/>An amazing performance from Pheonix that deserves an Oscar in my mind. He's a very different Joker to Ledger however. Ledgers joker was highly intelligent and anarchic with a dose of insanity. This Joker is insane to the membrane and almost stumbles into the role of the instigator of anarchy and destruction.<br/><br/>Many critics have severely dropped the ball on this one. The film won an award at the Venice film festival but on IMDB while viewers reviews stand at 9/10 which is about right on my reckoning, the critics stand at 5.8, only certain critics have given it the credit it deserves.<br/><br/>I think many critics have wondered about the influence of the film. Amongst a plethora of films with large amounts of casual violence, one critic even asked the question about ""is the violence justified"" in this film. The violence in Joker is relatively limited compared to many modern films but when it comes its hard hitting and the psychotic nature of it is in no way glamourising violence. Another said the ""social commentary is garbage"". Really?<br/><br/>The film sketches out the development of the character that gives the reasons for why he turns out to be a killer. However please do not confuse reasons set out through a careful and consistent character development with justification of the killing. This is not the same thing - being afraid to come up with reasons because it may be confused as justification can result in rather insipid films. Another person could experience the same and never turn out to be a killer. Its when you put a person with psychopathic tendencies through this mill with virtually useless mental health support and give him the means and motivation for violence then the result is tending on the inevitable.<br/><br/>Incidentally, there is a very interesting documentary I saw about psychopaths where the narrator takes the ""psychopath test"" and finds out that he has many traits common to a psychopath and realises that it explains some of the aspects of this personality but the reason why he his a normal functioning and valuable citizen is because he had a good loving upbringing and supportive family.<br/><br/>Flek lives in a city that itself is falling apart, the garbage isn't being collected and even super rats are roaming the streets. Even then there appear to be many that are living in wealth and even mocking the poor. Seriously what do you think may be likely to happen? Anyone heard of the French revolution (although no it actually nowhere as bad as that!)? If your someone who wants to keep this aspect of our reality ""under the lid"" and out of sight maybe you wont like this film. Otherwise go and enjoy! "
4062," 2019's Masterpiece
",
4063," It was a journey!
"," I'm literally home lying down trying to digest what I just saw. This movie was a masterpiece. It definitely requires more than one viewing to truly appreciate and understand the masterful work. This was my first viewing so I'll hold off on throwing out any ratings etc, but let me tell you this: it was a journey! It was honestly the little things that I was able to notice that really convinced me of Joaquin's performance. And his ability to just throw that laugh out there off and on cue was insane. This movie is truly something special!
Phoenix did an excellent job capturing the essence of the character in his performance.
I actually understood the protagonist, his inner battles, his journey. It was Genius, pure genius. It was in my opinion hauntingly excellent, and executed with great precision.
They basically just made this portrayal more realistic. Although it wasn't comic accurate (which it wasn't meant to be), I was happy to see Joker go off and be his true maniacal self. In other words, that R rating did wonders for his character. Much like Logan!
My only issue with it is the fact that they made this masterful piece to just be a one off. Why can't they make a cinematic universe built like this? Just like the MCU. "
4064," Masterpiece of 2019
"," Sat in the theater without any context , story started building with the perfect background score , you don't even wanna relate the acting of previous joker to this one , they were defined as sociopaths, but this one , you watch him see become one , and no Not a sociopath but a pyscopath. A damned unlucky human under the radar of life , JOKER has every thing a good movie should have , and this one's great ! "
4065," It moved me
"," A good movie for me is almost entirely weighted in its ability to stir emotions. Boy was I moved. It is the masterpiece that everyone speaks of. This Joker is very relatable, while his experiences and his reactions are more extreme than for most of us, when you see how environment shapes him it makes his character very real.<br/><br/>Character development is amazing. Music score is epic! Acting is fantastic. Every angle is perfection. This is quite possibly the best movie of all time. I find all the people hilarious who share the same sentiments and rate it a 9. "
4066," New approach to Joker character is perfect
"," This movie isn't for everyone. It isn't another action-packed superhero motion picture where you can find a lot of stupid gags, funny scenes or spectacular explosions. It's a new approach to Joker's character. It doesn't have much in common with previous films. It shows how did Joker originate, what ignited him to become a psycho killer, how did his mental illness evolve and why all of this even started. It's a tragedy of Joker.<br/><br/>Viewers and critics are divided in this case. A lot of people say that it's a masterpiece, Phoenix's acting was a masterwork. On the other side we have people who say it has nothing to do with this character. That they made him totally different from what we already know about him. But I think that was the case because all versions of Joker that we've already seen were already fully developed characters with somehow mysterious past. Here we can actually see one of interpretations of his origin.<br/><br/>If it comes to me, I belong to the first team. I find this movie very heavy. The feelings, the atmosphere and even music makes it totally different from all that we've already seen. Todd Phillips, Joaquin Phoenix and Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir made an amazing job. It was great to see a new approach to this character. 10 out of 10 for me. "
4067," Joaquin Phoenix - Name is Enough

Even if the film was not on their original version I could feel Joaquin's act by his action and facial expression I was deeply focused on the screen on the whole movie.

I should Thank Todd Phillips for imagining in a sensible way for portraying a perfect character. There are several edge of the seat moments and several jump out of shock moments. On the whole movie makes us to a roller coster of emotions played by just one MAN. I went with an open mind and came back with a heavy heart. I didnt see what's coming.

Love this film and remember it for all time. Joaquin is walking straight to an academy award for this. "
4084," Why 'Joker' has made us uncomfortable?
"," 'What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner, with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you deserve!'<br/><br/>The above quote is from Todd Phillips' brash new smash hit movie; 'Joker', which is based on DC's famous comic book villain. Never before has this infamous DC character which remains one of the most well-known comic book characters, had its own origin movie. Critics and fans alike have showered praise on Joaquin Phoenix, who has given a ground breaking performance which adds humanity to a character whose villainous exploits are well known, but the character itself remains an anomaly. Yet the film has also received some criticism, not because of Phoenix's performance or Todd Phillip's direction, but on the movie being too 'dark', and supposedly glorifying violence. This criticism is quite surprising, as neither the violence in the movie is more excessive than seen in recent years, and in terms of being 'dark', then once again it matches at the very least movies like, 'Mother!'; and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'. So what is the real reason for the supposed walk outs from showings of the film, and those 'offended' viewers who have had to resort to using social media outlets to vent their disgust? The answer lies within all of us, and how society as a whole views people with mental illness. 'Joker' is a movie that attempts to achieve something rare in cinema, and that is to bring realism to a comic book story, by raising important questions about modern day society. The film dares to be more than a fun filled, CGI injected comic book adaptation, and this is why some fans seem unsettled. Surely if watching grown men in costumes, is what you love, then you have had your fair share of the 'Avengers' saving the world, battling against outer-galactic enemies. However with 'Joker' we have the portrayal of a man who has suffered for most of his life, at the hands of his carers, professionals, colleagues, and most others who have crossed his path. Arthur Fleck, a la 'Joker', is a man who has been diagnosed with mental illness, and is struggling to lead a normal life, yet fails to receive the support he clearly requires. Arthur whose plight is ignored, becomes a victim of abuse at the hands of people who fail to understand him. Eventually something snaps, and the results are tragic. People who have criticised the film, have claimed that Arthur/Joker's actions may be used as inspiration by similarly disadvantaged people to perpetrate violence against society. Yet these short sighted individuals fail to understand the potent message behind the lead up to Arthur's transformation. However I am sure if the movie had shown that the acts of violence was committed by a foreigner, with a religious motive, than it would have been easily accepted. The fact that the film shows how society can drive a mentally ill white male to commit 'terrorist' acts have stirred some uncomfortable feelings about how we view mental illness, and even the stereo type of people perceived to be dangerous in our society. Or perhaps this movie does not fit the agenda we wish to consider at the moment. The discussion of mental illness, and its effects, have not yet been passed down from the government, because they still haven't finished with trying to force LGBT down our throats. Being part of that rainbow movement is fashionable at the moment, yet being a mentally ill loner has not yet reached the priority list of the policy makers.<br/><br/>I would advise that people accept what the film is trying to show, even if the climax is difficult to watch, or even more difficult to accept. We need to reflect upon how many people are suffering from mental illness, and how it effects them and their families. I have always felt that it is movies that are inspired by reality, and not the other way around. Joker is a bleak yet bold statement about the injustices of a society that preys on the weak, and maybe that's what we don't like. "

4086," 10/10
", Hahahah aye it was class like wasn't even a stupid superhero movie just some mad 
4087," Phoenix Rising
"," Joker is a human origin story that dispels the mystery behind the character known only as 'The Joker', or Jack Napier in the rarely referenced comic book lore. In this adaptation, it's a downtrodden Arthur Fleck. To me, this is not a comic book movie, it feeds into what is ultimately a comic book creation, but it offers a gritty realism that makes even 'The Dark Knight' look pretty.<br/><br/>These are the days before the Batman dons the mask to save Gotham from itself, but 'Joker' shows how the vigilante may just be settling a longstanding debt that has come back to haunt the Wayne family, it even may suggest why Batman is merciful of The Joker - you'll see just how Batman's greatest nemesis was created - and it will surprise you to great effect; even if it differs from the traditional origin story. Some critics suggest this movie hasn't much to say, but in the context of the overarching Batman story, it absolutely does.<br/><br/>It traded the notorious chemical incident and Chelsea smile for something perhaps a little less far-fetched - 'Joker' acknowledges the Batman universe, but the focus is very much on the concept and character that embodies the infamous clown and how the mask is a representation of chaos that can easily be spread, just as a mask can be used for justice. It's the Joker's turn in the limelight, as the Waynes are pushed to near minor characters, and cast in the shadow of moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>Did you know that although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention? This movie fittingly gives a nod to this part of the character's past in its closing scenes.<br/><br/>The movie also offers an explanation for The Joker's hysterical laughing; what was once a tragedy became a comedy - and the rest is history.<br/><br/>While fresh concepts carry this movie beyond the box office, it was slow in parts, and lacked a breadth of characters and locations. There weren't many grand sweeping shots of the Gotham landscape. There also weren't many subplots or cutaways to other characters, this isolated the plot into almost entirely Phoenix, where I feel there could have been opportunities to bring in other characters and perspectives.<br/><br/>I disliked the subplot with Sophie Dumond as it didn't add much to the story, and also felt as if Arthur's character could have been more eccentric, instead some of his scripting was jarring, perhaps deliberately so - there needed to be more one-liners to reflect the Joker's natural wit and flair, although his outright strangeness was captured quite well, if a bit excessively.<br/><br/>This movie delivers a solid punchline, 7.6/10. "
4088," Awesome
"," Being a big batman guy I always thought the Joker worked better without a backstory. But I also love my dark psychological movies, so this still sounded like it was going to be ace, and it is!<br/><br/>This isn't an action movie. It's a character study/back story and it has you feeling both sorry for and being creeped out by Phonex. Who (as everyone is saying) is amazing in the movie.<br/><br/>This is a well told, expertly made, gritty drama which grabbed my attention in a way that over the top CGI hasn't for a while now. This film is well paced, unpredictable and shocking in all the right places. DC made the right choice in getting creative and not sticking to the superhero formula here. "
4089," A movie that gives complete justice to the origin story of one of the most iconic comic villain and arch nemesis of Batman

4090," This is something special...
"," It is hard to describe the content and acting as anything other than astonishing. I felt uncomfortable, nervous and excited all at the same time through both of my current viewings, followed by a chilling buzz during the last few sequences of the film.
Phoenix's performance is nothing but perfect, I believed he was Arthur Fleck/Joker the entire way through and find it hard to look at him the same way now, all I can see is Joker. His performance was painful to watch, but in the right way. This is a character that does terrible things, but his journey and struggles are heart breaking to watch, the performance never lets off, you never feel truly comfortable.
Tod Philips did a great job of bringing an original in-depth version of the Joker to screen and I have no problem at all with it mimicking past films, it brings them all together is a justified and brilliant way.
This is now one of my favourite films ever, deserving the the praise it gets...the critics, clearly they just got offended. "
4091," Strong characters require strong performances
"," Featuring spectacular performance by Joaquin Phoenix ""Joker"" brings my best movie experience of the year.
The script is very elaborate, full of unexpected twists and the movie. The soundtrack of the film is very striking, the color palette is a spectacle and the close-ups on the protagonist only raise the level of the film.
I do not understand how critics may have rated this movie so poorly. The challenge is to get the audience to see the world through the lens of the villain and that it can do very well without redeeming Arthur's crimes and villainy.
Joker is the movie I most enjoyed watching in 2019 and also has become one of my favorite movies of all ! Grade 10 more than deserved. "

4094," Awesome! (some spoilers)
"," I know that there has been a lot of hubbub about this film, where people are saying that it was misogynistic or that it's the ""incel movie"", but I have to say that if people say this after watching the movie... they clearly weren't paying attention.<br/><br/>If this film has any message, it's that the mental health system is severely flawed and that everyday life is geared towards the rich. It's understaffed and underfunded, resulting in people who really, REALLY want to seek out help (as in the case of Arthur at the beginning of the film) going with subpar or no help at all. Not to mention that the system in place ended up cutting public funding, which is an all too bitter reflection on what happens IRL to programs such as these. Then for the news to paint the three dead Wayne Enterprises guys as practically saints and for Wayne to effectively paint all of the city's poorer citizens as stupid, jealous, and violent clowns as a result, that just hammers home that the system is more in favor of the ""have"" than the ""have nots"". With all of that, it's no surprise that the citizens of Gotham rioted. They were treated like the garbage that littered their streets. The Joker was just a catalyst that really set the smoldering unrest ablaze and I honestly think that if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and became an icon as a result. I have to say that I really do like how the Joker said that he wasn't a political person. When it comes to public aid and how people are treated, this shouldn't be treated as only a political thing. Yes, it can be political but it's fundamentally a moral issue - it's wrong to treat people as lesser and to cut funding that would benefit the less fortunate in order to make things easier for the fortunate and their pet projects. It's made painfully clear throughout the film that if Arthur had received any true human compassion beyond the caring yet distant compassion offered by his social worker or the manipulative and deluded compassion his mother gave him (if you can even call her behaviors that), his life may have gone in a different direction. Maybe not incredibly different, but still different.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job as the Joker. It's kind of amazing to see how much he sunk into that role. He lost so much weight that it's really startling and helps to form a good suspension of disbelief. Hollywood uses so many of the same actors that many of them come across as ""This Person playing themselves playing X character"". I see Phoenix as one of those actors that, while recognizable, can fully lose themselves in a character and are more than just playing themselves playing someone.<br/><br/>I was really amazed at how quickly the film went by. Some of the moments were honestly painful to watch, as it's easy enough to feel sorry for Arthur at times. He's just so sad and broken that you can't help but wish that things would go a little better. I also loved the little nods to the various comic book series that featured the Joker, such as the Dr. Sally kiss - a scene taken from The Dark Knight Returns. It's subtle without demanding that the viewer know about the comics in the way that Batman vs. Superman did of its viewers. No viewer will feel like they had to study before going into the theater. Of note, however, is that apparently the director has stated that this isn't THE Joker, but rather a person that inspired him.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that this will be one of those films that will be studied in film classes, yet dismissed as a ""violent nasty"" by some in the same way that some critics are now. I can understand that some won't like this - no film will be universally liked, but I can't help but feel that by focusing on the violence they're really kind of missing the point of this movie. "

4102," A Loser Kicked One Too Many..
"," I didn't intend to see this movie at all, because I thought what can a Batman movie bring anew, and I was surprised to read oldest cinema festival in the world gave it Best Picture award. It felt displaced.
Then I have seen the amazed reactions from viewers, saying it wasn't what they have expected, one was even (half seriously, half jokingly - hey, like Joker!) flirting with social uprising in his comments. (Joker says he's not political. He's just one of the lowest, being pushed one too often. The lowest masses can identify with that. In less confident societies, such movies got banned.)
So, I have decided to see it, and yes, it's not your usual blockbuster from the Batman franchise. Such a movie, with main character having mental issues, societal issues, family issues, relationships issues, sort of Turrets Syndrome issues, younameit issues, would usually fit the Sundance or even more alternative, indie, heavy movies festivals, not receiving praises from mainstream audiences, having a 9something rating on IMDB and breaking the overall October opening record in domestic market. Youth is filling the cinemas to see it, although there's not one flashy gadget or usual CGI scene from the franchise. Have the times really changed and will newer generations demand a wholesame approach to all the disadvantaged (and the Earth)? Oscars buzz all over the place. Perfect songs to perfect scenes. The atmosphere and ambience of the movie is visually depressing, pressing down on a drowning, smiling hero. If you gotta go, go with a smile..
When Joker says, he's got nothing left to loose, before loosing it, after he's been trying really hard to be a good and normal, contributing member of the society (even trying to have an intellectual career as a stand up comedian, yet also doing demeaning jobs like a rolling sign), and whole movie convinces you it's society's fault he became the monster we know, you start thinking it's surprising all those homeless people don't start killing everyone. I can also understand the already expressed worries, movie might send some troubled mind on a shooting spree again.. Mistreated persons might go crazy. "
4103," I like it
", I don't know was it really deserve oscar or not . But as acting is fantastic. Direction is perfect in every detail 
4104," Instant Classic!
"," All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.
The way Joaquin Phoenix handles Arthur Fleck from being oppressed to a lunatic, giving that amount of detail and depth to every subtle development of the character and let it thrive throughout the movie is just phenomenal to watch. Todd Phillips's JOKER is an instant classic. "
4105," Simply outstanding

", Wow. There wasn't a second in this movie i didn't like. The acting was incredible. The way the director and Leaf Phoenix presented the Joker's journey into insanity and at the same time confidence was just incredible. I can't remember in recent times leaving a movie and thinking about it for so long afterwards. I have to see it in theatres again.

4109," Arthur Fleck 'Becomes' The Joker
"," This is a movie which really creates and portrays Arthur's journey from being a simple man into one of the most evil characters. Joaquin Phoenix is immense in this movie, the steps he takes to become what 'He' wants but is ultimately affected (negatively) by the environment he lives in. His life is severely impacted by the many events that unfold during the course of the movie and now I have a (somewhat) profound respect for the 'Joker'. This is an amazing portrayal of how chaos exists within every human being, which at the right moment explodes!!!<br/><br/>This movie is not centered around the number of body counts, nor explosions or plots to kill certain individuals. This is about 'Arthur' and his life and how he becomes this 'Legend' of a character.<br/><br/>Please watch this with an open mind and solely focus on the character rather than the plot which you would wish to see. "

"," Joker is something different for the comic book genre, but in a good way. The film is fantastic in terms of story, acting, design and cinematography that make it another one of the best films in said genre that is on the same level as The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix in the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker is outstanding! The supporting cast's acting are very well done. The last 20 minutes of this film is amazing and terrifying at the same time, it's just that good. Don't miss out your chance to see this film on the big screen, go see it! "
4115," Amazing

4116," A must watch
"," This is the kind of movie you won't ever forget. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an amazing and uneasy performance, this one is a must watch. "
4117," Incredible
"," After a long while, a movie without fake feeling, without fancy special effects, a perfect music production and real play by actors. This movie will get many awards and definitely the best actor and best music "
4118," Great movie
", I've never enjoyed and got immersed in a movie as much as I did with the Joker. The actor deserves an Oscar and the movie deserves being watched at least twice. 
4119," Amazingly realistic cinematic piece that requires serious, critical reflection
"," Joker is both shocking and provoking while still being chillingly realistic. This is an applausing psychological/social analysis and demonstration. It feels so real, that's why it feels so horrifying. The unexpected storyline along with Joaquin's excellent acting combined is definitely worth 4.5/5. However, I recommend that you be prepared and bring a serious mindset when watching this film, because it is quite graphically disturbing in a very realistic way that it reminds me of the mass murder cases in real life. I have a headache ever since I walked out of the cinema, I must say.... "
4120," Glorious
"," I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been mentioned, but I was so thrilled to see Joaquin use every cell in his body to give us this twisted and broken antihero. The climactic scene was so beautiful and choreographed impeccably. Diamonds from coal. Gave me chills. Can't wait to see it again. "
4121," Welcome to the Emancipation of Arthur Fleck
",
4122," Remarkable
", I was skeptical about this movie because I though it would be too difficult to give justice to the character of Joker comparing it to the amazing performance of Heath Ledger. But Joaquin managed to do that remarkably.<br/><br/>I didn't find the movie disturbing and I love every bit of it. This is by far one of the best movies I've seen. 
4123," Masterpiece that proves film isn't dead
"," In a world where mindless super hero films, reboots, and bad remakes dominate Hollywood, it leaves a lot to be desired. When you actually find all great let alone a good film at times it's like wining a few hundred bucks. Joker for me shows there is hope.<br/><br/>Now, anyone that went into this film not knowing it was a dark, character study clearly didn't watch the trailers or read up on it, or they would know it's a backstory film that's going to be an obvious slow burn before the inevitable. Clearly, people just assumed it's called Joker so it's all Joker. Nope not by a long shot. Next time watch the trailers and read.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Arthur Fleck who is a wannabe comedian and semi-professional clown. Arthur does not have much luck in life let alone much to look forward to. On a side note, he's also mentally ill but many of us are so we move along the best we can.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Arthur, he has a lot of bad luck in life to which he starts to crumble a bit. Later on he feels a couple of daggers that change and affect him tremendously, which results in a downward spiral resulting in The Joker or in reality Joker.<br/><br/>The film is very dark and set around 1981 before one of its biggest influences Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy came out. It's also heavily influenced by Scorsese's Taxi Driver with shades of Clockwork Orange and even Network. It pays off.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix further proves or just put the nail in the coffin for anyone that he is the best actor currently working today in delivering an electrifying performance much worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Phillips shows he is a real filmmaker with this film and also shows he's a student of 70s cinema when anything was possible. Easily one of the best of the year, if not the best. "
4124," Phoenix Delivers An Oscar Winning Performance
"," Was completely mesmerized by Phoenix's performance in this film. Absolutely astounding, he had me eating out of the palm of his hand. He boldly emoted every nuance of the central character, using a very Method technique. Physically, he obviously lost a great deal of weight. His face is all sharp angles and eyes, perfect for his many close ups. His body looks lithe, nearly skeletal, which is showcased in scenes of him bent, writhing, and dancing. The costuming makes great use of Phoenix's height and weight, clothing him in tight, tall lines and going from ragged, dreary everyday thrift shop clothing to the eventual final appearance in the Joker's familiar suited attire, in it's garish colors of blood and dirt.<br/><br/>Phoenix speaks perhaps 15 minutes of full dialogue in this performance, but he uses his face, his entire body, to communicate to the audience every moment of his character's state of mind. The audience is captivated as he shows us, not tells us, exactly what Arthur is experiencing. His is a bleak tale of madness and woe. Arthur's alter-ego, the Joker, embodies his incarnation as 'The Lord of Chaos', spinning deeper and deeper into insanity and anarchy with the audience held captive. Until we, like Arthur, aren't sure what is real and what is fantasy anymore.<br/><br/>I'm totally perplexed as to media reviews that are concerned that the public may be somehow compelled to violence as a result of this film. No sane person will be compelled to rise in anarchy against the rich or against the government because they see Joker. Joker states in the film by reason of explanation, that he does what he does out of DESPAIR against humanity's capabilities to be mean to one another. He just wants everyone to get along. ""Why can't you just be...NICE?!"" The story of this film, as I saw it, was the story of how one person succumbs to insanity finally, after a life of horrific abuse and abject poverty. Yes, I felt bad for the character. Do I condone the violence that the Joker perpetuates in the film because of his circumstances? No, I didn't. No reasonably sane person will either. All it will take is one nutjob stating he committed some terrible act, for this film to be wrongfully attributed to causing mayhem and be dismissed entirely wrongfully from the Oscar picks it deserves: Best Director, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Cinematography. "
4125," A worthy heir to the character! Spoiler warning
"," It's all in the laugh. It's such a fresh take on why joker became joker. I actually ended up sympathizing for him. All my life I was led to believe Thomas Wayne was a good man. There were soo many instances I felt he could change society, having money and power. Joker showed us the other side of the coin. And he is an illegitimate son of Thomas Wayne!! Dayum. The best part is l liked the way the uncertainty is shown, maybe he is insane, maybe there was a cover up from the Wayne's. What a performance, the music is phenomenal. Darkness embraced. "
4126," Insane acting, betiful music score, depressing theme
"," My goodness, the people that play joker always wants to one up each other. Phoenix was insanely good portraying him. From his movements, laughing, dancing, mannerisms, it was very believable. This is a guy that put everything into the role. Add the haunting music in certain scenes just make it that much more distubring. Movie was depressing, but the acting was next level. "

4131," Not the Joker we know from the comics
"," I'm a big fan of the DC comic universe and Joker has always been one of my favorite bad guys. This is not that Joker.<br/><br/>This story is totally stand alone as Joker from the comics has never been given a back story.<br/><br/>Don't expect too much action here, the movie isn't about that, it's all about Jokers decent into madness.<br/><br/>The hype around this movie I think is just part of it's advertising as there is nothing in this movie that's ""hyper violent"" or anything that graphic really. He kills a total of 6 people in the entire movie, 4 with a gun, one stabbing/head smashing into wall and one smothering. I laughed at the ""news"" stories about people walking out of the movie being sick...I'm not sure where those stories come from. I recently saw John Wick 3 and the violence in that movie is hundreds of times what this movie is. In fact I would even call the violence in this movie pretty tame by today's standards.<br/><br/>The star of this movie is of course Joaquin's acting. The depths he goes to play this kind of insanity is astounding. Giving the Joker the strange laughing mental illness was a great idea. Think tourettes but instead of swearing and ticks he laughs, it's really clever.<br/><br/>During the movie I actually felt for him, he gets pushed around so much I was almost cheering when he shot the bullies on the train.<br/><br/>It's a great story, slow, yes, but very compelling and I didn't feel bored throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about the top user review on this page as he calls it the best film to bring a comic book to life - it's not based on any comic book. Also using the words disturbing and violent feels a bit much, it's not that bad...<br/><br/>Oh and the way Joker runs is fantastic, he runs a lot in this movie and it's just funny to watch. "
4132," This Movie is Banger
", 10/10 must watch. 
4133," The movie we needed, not the movie we deserved.
"," I'm writing this right after my first viewing, but when I say this, I absolutely mean it. This movie will blow your mind. It is like a car crash. You literally can't look away. Everything about it was done so well, from the score to the plot and everything in between. Just wow. I can definitely see why people have and will have problems with this movie, but it serves as a social commentary that shouldn't be ignored. "
4134," Good by comparison
", This movie is pretty good. By comparison most movies are crap. It gives a good portrayal of someone slipping through the cracks. It is NOT as good as some reviews are saying. Phoenix was actually much more mesmerizing in You Were Never Really There. 
4135," Not a superhero movie
"," ""Joker"" takes us to a mentally ill, underprivileged person' world. We experience cruel, judgmental and selfish people in the society. I loved the message that this movie is trying to deliver: we should take care of those who are unable to take care of themselves.
It wasn't even important if Brett Cullen was actually Phoenix's father or not. He was responsible for him, either as a father, or as a powerful, influential character. We need to realize that those who are born in underprivileged families, or those who are traumatized in young ages, and are not able to cope with a ""normal"" society must be taken care of. "

"," This is not your average supervillian movie, and that has never been such a good thing. This movie stands out beyond the superhero genre. It is a movie that will last. Through the lense of the current climate it can be viewed as fairly volatile, youll have to be a sane rational human and try not to think of it with that bias and enjoy it for the story it is, in the time period in which it is set. "
4138," Great build up for explosive ending
"," This movie is not about 'how much action can we cram into one sitting', rather, it is about the slow build up of a truly twisted character. Arthur's character is the sole focal point during the entire film, allowing the audience to live through his backstory with no interruptions. The music, dancing, and crude laughter draws you into the world of Arthur, and eventually, the Joker. With that being said, the transformation into the Joker is a very intense and occasionally bloody journey; but, every step of this process has meaning behind it and nothing seemed overly done, or out of place. Some scenes are very dark, but the backstory leading up to them makes them even more impactful when witnessing them on the screen.
I wouldn't know what the correct category for this movie is, but it hits hard in the psychological department as you watch this character's mind explode out of its shell by the end. "
4139," Phoenix's Perfomance.....

4140," Brilliantly Done, Definitely Movie of the Year
"," I never thought I'd become a fan of the joker but the movie was a masterpiece. It touched on many societal issues and the story unfolded just perfectly. Phoenix's acting was brilliant. Every scene was just beautiful and even the killing was depicted in an aesthetic way. Kudos to Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>For the mainstream critics who think this movie is somehow controversial, instead of blaming movies and video games for potential shooting, think about what really has been happening in our society that pushes people off the edge to do crazy things like that. I think you guys can learn a great lesson from the movie Joker. "
4141," Beautiful take on Joker's Point of View
", This film vastly exceeded my expectations. I don't normally buy into the hype but this is worth every praise. Joaquin Phoenix delivered this role so masterfully - I was glued to my seat for every second. I honestly do believe everyone should watch this - it raises some very interesting themes such as the failure of society to recognise mental illness and the lack of funding and resources to recognise a normal person's descent into antisocial acceptance.

4144," DC take a bow. They've finally cracked it. A Must See!
"," Just got home from watching the movie and I must say it was a breathtakingly triumphant body of work. The layers within the film, the character development and the homage to ""King of Comedy"" was very clever indeed.
Joaquin was brilliant but a lot must be said for the rest of the casting. Some really good choices for sure. And surprising at that.
The only thing I felt was either remarkably purposefully dark or somehow overlooked was the choice of Gary Glitter's ""Rock &amp; Roll Pt 2"" as one of the soundtracks. Great song and fitted perfectly with the era but it isn't without some baggage.
Besides that, i cant wait to see it again very soon. A masterpiece. "

",
4150," Only certain people can relate
"," In my opinion the purpose of making this joker a film so that people's minds are open, can see it from different sides / perspectives. There is no film that justifies / teaches if the murder is true, it is not possible to teach revenge which is the right thing. So the goal here is how we treat ourselves for other people / people suffering from this disease. while Arthur was on the Murray Franklin show he said 'Thomas Wayne doesn't know that people can be wild' wild which means here are those who don't get justice and want to vent their anger. So my conclusion is that crime not only comes from people's desires but can also be caused by accidental or unwillingness of people about it but only wants to respond accordingly. that's why religion is important. And the creation of the Joker character is due to the people who created their own demons "
4151," Sad, painful to watch at times. But very, very good. Perhaps the best?
"," This is a very different/ perhaps disappointing movie for all those who seek simple-fast-action- slashing &amp; superpowers. ( See some of the low ratings)
This movie is about real life sadness, fragility and coping with that. This is not a about the cold blooded super villain, (yet) The one who blows up buildings and burns you all. Oh and without machine guns or cgi fake stuff. But due to that the most dangerous of all.
This is a gritty psychological drama. I am hoping for an elaborate picture of this character.
This was exactly what the comic movie genre needed! A story of a kind man, whose life is ridden with sadness and bad luck. Instead of having superpowers or all the money in the world.
Its about coping, system flaws and realizing what may become of that.
Yes, we are all rooting for him now! Don't we?
I Loved Arthur and this is one of the better movies i have seen in past years. Please bring more of this.
Well done ! "

This movie deserves MANY WINS. "

"," Just got back home from seeing this a second time. I loved it even more. I say this with no exaggeration... This film is a masterpiece. Please go see it, but be prepared for some heavy material. This is a very real exploration of a psychopathic killer. It is extremely violent, and often hard to watch, but always with a purpose. Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable. He disappears completely into this character. The evolution we see this tortured man go through would have fallen flat with a lesser actor in the role. Luckily, Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. On the technical end, this film is beautifully shot and Todd Philips' direction is haunting. The story, while familiar, is unique and fresh. Overall, this is the best Joker movie we could have ever hoped for. It's absolutely brilliant. "

"," Believe the hype. What I have just witnessed is one of the most beautiful, harrowing and thought provoking films ever. Phoenix gives the performance of his life (he's come a long way since his vexed Gladiator days) and there's a relatable bit of Joker in is all, which adds to the tension.

4162," Who would have thought that Joker could be relatable!
"," What would happen if someone took a beloved villain and rewrote their entire history? Surely, at first everyone would freak, because of the caricature of the character recent adaptions have offered. This is not the case here. Joker is what happens when they take a well worn character and they actually develope them, not just give them a modern day outlook but without the respective way of thinking. Basically it is like the writer thought how would the Joker be created today, without the toxic wastes. In my opinion, Joker is a brilliant combination of comic book accuracy and innovation, giving modern means and conditions to the villain we know (if after watching the movie we can still call him that), while also staying true to what makes the character tick. "
4163," Early comments on Joker 2019
",
4164," A cinematic masterpiece, though gut wrenching
"," I have never thought to rate a movie. Personally, no movie comes to mind other than this title that is really worth raving about so ceaselessly as I've done since I saw it in theaters. I'll admit that I have no previous interest in superhero/villain movies, comics, etc, and I never really got into the whole Batman thing, BUT this film has me impressed. It's a different breed, and that's what I like about it. It explores the mind of a struggling man in a troubled life, and Joaquin Phoenix plays the part phenomenally. It's believable, it portrays interesting examples of what may happen with a mental illness, and the emotion I drew from it had me squirming in my seat. Many parts were uncomfortable, yes, but that may be because I'm a sensitive person, and the movie inducing this feeling isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seeks out emotion and sympathy.
I'm no great and knowledgeable movie critic, as I stated prior, but I did enjoy Joker enough to go as far as to make an IMDb account just to rate the movie. I enjoyed it that much. I do plan on purchasing a DVD of the film as soon as possible and giving it a re-watch. "

"," Do not get the love for this film at all...<br/><br/>I didn't see the need for a Joker origin story but the trailer came along &amp; looked pretty good. So I went in prepared to enjoy this Elseworld version of the Joker.<br/><br/>Problem was, The Joker didn't turn up for his own film.<br/><br/>Just some bloke who worked as a clown who had various knocks thrown at him which caused him to murder some guys (in self defence) &amp; then shoot someone else <br/><br/>Not a bad film as films go, but certainly not a Joker I recognise.

"," Managing to stay true to the comics in an origin sorry based on the joker is tricky, due to the very nature of the character and the lack of knowledge of his former life which we have to go on. Without spoiling anything, much of this movie takes place in the viewers own mind. Leaving more questions by the end than you had going in, the movie manages to pull off showing us the Jokers history, while having us question if what we are seeing is in any way real, or if it depicts the character we think we all know. There are a few nods to the batman comics, but it isn't a batman movie in any way. Really, it isn't even a joker movie. It's a movie about a fractured mind in a fractured world, and it's self imposed confirmation, slowly becoming a character we both love and loath. Creepy, disturbing, intense. Phoenix really nails this version of the character, but also manages to capture the lonely, sad life of Arthur, leading us to fully understand, and both completely misunderstand the journey he takes during the course of the film. "

Though something was pulling the whole package down, for the movie to be top notch. Joaquin put on a tragic victim scene, a person rotting/broke down by system in Gotham city, but story didn't reflect much of it. Why did he had to kill 3 people? Can't get enough empathy for his actions. The whole story theme was in trailer.
Having said this, I still want to see it many times, see the Joaquin act again. Something is still captivating about the JOKER that makes it such a great movie to watch "

The thing I absolutely loved about ""Joker"" is the slow burn. From the opening shot, Phoenix and Phillips are able to convey a knot in your stomach and that feeling doesn't go away until long after you've seen the movie. Joaquin Phoenix is the real deal. A complete game changer in method acting, he is hypnotizing. That is the perfect word to describe the performance; hypnotizing. A true Oscar contender and it will be hard to beat his performance because it is the best of the year. Will I compare Phoenix's performance to Heath Ledger's? No. That was the past and this is the now, and Phoenix's performance is what we need now. Aside from being a brilliant stand alone film, ""Joker"" pays hommages to so many great films of its genre from the 70s and 80s. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is simply haunting. I'll also mention that you will never listen to Frank Sinatra's ""That's Life"" the same again. Bottom line: yes, you should see this movie.

",
4183," Todd Philips tried his best, and it was pretty good in the end.
"," Few problems with the pacing, and some cliche 'checklist' type scenes in the movie, and the background storyline setup could have used more attention, but otherwise really good film and killer third act. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect in this movie (well, the role was written for him) and despite a bit of muddled messages from the movie, It's definitely not one that would incite incel violence or anything of the sort. The movie is ultimately more about mental illness and socioeconomic class. "
4184," Another time when critics are in the wrong and the audience is in the right.
"," As I am writing this, Joker has a 9,0 IMDB rating from around 150 000 userratings, and a 58 metascore rating. I honestly believe that this is due to critics not wanting to be seen recommending a ""terrorism-motivating"" movie, because the audience is clearly in the right here.<br/><br/>I gave this a clear 10/10 because it simply deserves it. The score was breathtaking and the directing was amazing, especially considering he is someone with a background in mostly adult comedy movies. The cinematography was also very good. And then, the acting. I want to go as far as saying it is the best performance I have ever seen on the big screen (though, keep in mind, I don't go to the movietheatre THAT frequently).<br/><br/>Go see this movie. It is probably tied with Endgame on movie of the year for me. "
4185," Very powerful and enlightening! !
"," I guess many people have misunderstood this movie and I believe only those who have been exposed to such conditions will fully understand its message. It doesn't encourage to violence or justify it, but it shows how much bullying, abusing, and living within unjust societies, can be harmful and hurtful, and shows to where it can lead. I didn't care much about the violence or darkness rather than focusing on ""soul killing"" and being ""not afraid of losing anymore"" because of all the tragedies that joker passed through, the violence and the extreme incidents are just there to make the message more powerful and enlighten the minds of people who never passed through such conditions. "
4186," A Masterpiece
"," An incredible movie. Most of the scenes are so cruel, it's finger lickin good. Joaquin is the star of the movie. Amazing acting and the way he walks is just like the Joker that we all know. At the beginning I thought his laugh will irritate you, but it doesn't. The laugh gets each scene a more awfull feeling, you really feel his pain and you almost explain away his kills. I have to say nice k/d, he killed like 7/8 people and didn't die.<br/><br/>A masterpiece. "
4187," Sickeningly Superb
"," It's rare for a film to stay with me into the next day, but this was such a powerfully disturbing, brilliantly acted story that I was thinking about it on and off for a long time. Joker is a deeply thoughtful, visceral reflection on the sad brokenness of a life cruelly twisted by the sins of others, that leads to hatred and violence. It is a dramatic tour-de-force from Joaquin Phoenix. "
4188," The Joker
"," This movie was amazing, super dark and gritty. Made you sympathize with him for his mental illness while also watching how such can alter someone's mind to do crazy things. "
4189," I didn't like the trailer...
"," I have to admit when i saw the trailers i was not hooked, but the movie blew me away.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix simply carries the entire movie by himself, even though sometimes it has weird and uncomfortable even disturbing scenes i was mesmerized through the entire time. The acting the screenplay, the cinematography is fantastic simply to say this is how an origin story should be told.<br/><br/>Go and watch the movie and somebody give this man an Oscar! "

4192," Insanely twisted.
"," I went into this movie with VERY high expectations because of all the rave reviews and controversy and I as not disappointed at all. In fact it exceeded my expectations. I've never seen a more gritty, dark and twisted movie in my life.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best if not THE BEST acting performances I've ever seen. He is by far the best joker so far. From the Joker's laugh, mannerisms, down to the way her runs. Joaquin perfected it all. He definitely deserves every award this coming season. Heath Ledger would be proud.<br/><br/>Just don't watch it expecting an action packed comic movie. It's all about the joker's origin and his slow decent into insanity. It's so unsettling and uneasy I can see why some people walked out. It's a very brutal and honest look at mental illness and how society treats people with it. "
4193," A Masterpiece
", This is the best comicbook movie of 2019 hands down. I know people are thinking this movie is overrated. But it's not. I love this movie. Can't wait to see it again :) 
4194," Haunting and mesmerising
"," Joker review. NO SPOILERS. Simmering, haunting,brooding, painful, mesmerising,violent,shocking,powerful and yet beautiful.Just some of the adjectives that come to mind after last nights viewing. This is not an easy watch.It a slow burning character piece which gradually builds into a powerful demonstration of a man slowly breaking down. Joaquin Phoenix performance is extraordinary and completely convincing.He completely buries himself in the Arthur Fleck/Joker character and you feel a strange empathy with his sad isolated life.An Oscar nomination is nailed on.The cinematography is beautiful and it has deep dark score with a grinding cello that sticks in your head. For me it captures the frustration of the people and I couldn't help but compare certain aspects to certain political situations we experience today . Not for the faint hearted and it can be uncomfortable at times but it is totally successful in explaining Flecks tortured demise into insanity. Score 9/10Haunting and painful "
4195," Phoenix masterclass
"," This movie was everything I expected and more the clever back and forth in to the mind of a clinically unstable man making you feel almost empathetic to his plight and fantastic supporting roles by beets and de Niro make this film a joy to watch
Don't expect a suicide squad type film from this, this is what dc should have been doing for years with the batman franchise the gritty darkness really brings Gotham to life and humanises thomas Wayne in a way all past films have failed to do so.
If Phoenix does not get an Oscar for this film it would be a travesty he was simply faultless in the whole film, he has you truly believing that he is mentally disturbed and also helps you understand why without being too blunt about it his performance was not just fantastic but also fantastically clever if this film doesn't bring light to the plight of the mentally ill in modern society then I truly don't know what will.<br/><br/>This film will go down in history as a masterpiece that is not in any doubt as will Phoenix for his portrayal or Arthur fleck in this eye opening masterpiece "
4196," An absolute breath of fresh air for the DC universe.
"," As a die hard cynic regarding everything DC cinematic universe, this adaptation was an absolute breath of fresh air. There is no comparison to the flawless storyline, actors and cinematography of this film.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise that surpasses expectations and criticisms/ cyncisms as a comic fan. Phenomenal job "
4197," Great movie
", It's a classic movie and it will shake your bones from inside which is groosome 
4198," Woah!
"," Along with the lies and the traumatic abuse he experienced through out his life, and the hate in the world that seems to hit him head on, Arthur began to take matters, good and bad, into his own life afte he learns a dark secret about his life.<br/><br/>JOKERis a true fictional take of what mental illness sometimes is too some people. We, as a society, look at many people such as Nikolas Cruz and the many others that are guilty of the MASS SHOOTINGS, like they are just sick and crazy and throw them in the chamber. However, I am not condoning their actions, many people, young and older areignore certain times that show signs of endangering others. My belief, and after watching this movie, we need to start paying attention and act and prevent these such situations.
""An outstanding and phenomenal picture. Joaquin Phoenix is Brilliant. Todd Phillips's first film away from comedy, and he Delivers a KNOCK OUT."" "
4199," Brilliant acting and cinematography, dragged a little.
"," Todd Phillips expertly depicted economic stagnation, social isolation, and cultural marginalization in a film which thoroughly reflects the times in which it was written. Although the film dragged for too long toward the end of the Joker's descent into villainy, its expert cinematography, Oscar-worthy acting, and contained plot line work harmoniously to evoke a visceral, poignant, and unescapable feeling of apathy. By the climax of the film I was uncomfortable, entirely impatient, and on the edge of my seat in frustrated anticipation of a euphoric and violent ending.<br/><br/>This is an urban drama and phycological thriller well worth the ticket price; Not to mention, it's a DC franchise film.<br/><br/>9/10. "
4200," Descend into madness with Joaquin Phoenix!
"," This movie is an absolute masterpiece of cinema with an amazing score and filmography that shows the fall to insanity rather than telling you. I expect ""Joker"" to have a cult following for years to follow, a must-see movie on the list of many. It was an amazing, entertaining, and impressionable film that the audience will take home to ponder and discuss. The film depicts talent in story-telling and performance. I genuinely didn't want the movie to end; Joaquin Phoenix is so mesmerizing to watch on screen (playing the joker to the highest standard I've seen thus far) that I would be disappointed if the academy looks over his performance. I'm calling for an Oscar! And a sequel! The ""Joker"" is the best movie I've seen this year, and it'll be the best movie you've seen this year too. Get a ticket and descend into madness! Dance your way home afterwards just as I did! "
4201," Not for the people with a sensitivity
"," The movie is very dark and disturbing!
It shows character transformation of a normal man with a mental illness who is just trying earn a living and take care of his mother. But the society is such that it lacks compassion for such individuals and calls him a freak, bullies him and corners him to such an extent that he becomes a true agent of chaos. "

Earns its hard R too.<br/><br/>9/10 "
4207," Surpassed expectations
"," I'm a huge DC fan. I knew from the first trailer this was going to be a good movie. Joaquin Phoenix surpasses all my expectations. His performance deserves an Oscar. Also, the music was so haunting and beautiful. It definitely helped set the tone. Couldn't have been better. This movie makes you think about the affects society can have on a person. Can't wait to see it again. "
4208," Joaquin puts a human being into the Joker
"," Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie was stunning as he plays a mentally challenged man who lives in an even crazier world. The movie explains how Arthur evolves into The Joker we know from Batman. However, this Joker is vulnerable and a victim of traumatic circumstances. I am moved by how well Joaquin brings this comic character to life and creates an image of a believable human being who doesn't want to be a victim anymore. There are several thought provoking elements in this movie - like, this is what happens when you place a gun into the hands of a mentally and emotionally lost and drainef person. Can't wait to see this movie again - I personally find Joaquins acting exceptional and mesmorizing - and Oscar worthy! "
4209," If This Movie Doesn't Get An Oscar We Must All RIOT!oro
"," This movie was freakin fantastic! The cinematography, the writing, the acting, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Hands down for the director Todd Philips for writing such a masterpiece, and most importantly to Joaquin Phoenix for killing is as The Joker!<br/><br/>PS Don't believe what the critics say. It's their job to find a problem to every solution. They get paid to spread hate and negativity about movies. "
4210," Genius
"," Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely sublime. This film is incredibly grim and dark but opens the door for discussion about mental health and bullying, and the sociological factors that enthrall the circumstances of any pivotal breakdown. There's a lot of points of views on this film out there but I would strongly suggest watching it to understand the entire narrative. Definitely thought provoking, and not the typical comic book adaptation. This was a thoroughly rooted piece of work. I loved it. Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance. "
4211," Mesmerizing
", Mesmerizing! Joaquin Phoenix is a genius. I am still shaking. 
4212," What a marvel

4213," Outstanding performance of Joaquin!
",
4214," Nature vs Nurture
"," Joaquin Is good as usual. I thought this movie Had good writing, acting and was visually interesting. On another day I might give this 9 stars. I just felt more sorry then captivated by the Joker. I guess that's the point , but I wasn't really that entertained. I'm hoping we see Joaquin In a sequel. "
4215," INCREDIBLE
", Juaqin Pheonix is amazing in this film! He deserves best actor at the academy awards hands down!!! I'm ready for the next DC movie!! Mostly I just want this to have a sequel.<br/><br/>He doesn't play joker the same as Heath Ledger. I love Ledgers version more. Phoenix plays it very differently but was very very very good!!! 
4216," Chilling
"," This rendition of the Joker is absolutely nuts! That is simply the only rational way to describe. I went into the movie with very high expectations, and may I say those expectations have been exceeded. The way Phoenix portrays him is so incredible, and the scariest part is that he managed to humanize this psychopath and almost make you pity him. I left the movie theater in a state of shock, not completely comprehending the beauty I just saw.
Another thing which was done so beautifully in this movie was the way that it strayed away from the DCU and comic book movies as a whole. If this film could be closely related to any film prior it would be ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese. All in all, it was incredible movie that is more than likely to make some serious noise at the upcoming oscars! "
4217," All it takes is one day.
",
4218," Entertainingly Intense!
"," This is definitely the best movie out of DC extended universe. You'll feel the struggle arthur went through from the first part of the movie, you will feel sorry for him. and the cinematography is really good too, the tone, the vibe, everything how you'd imagine gotham would be like is there. character arc is amazing as well, from the point that he's just a regular dude trying to make money up to the point that he just lost it. Joaquin and de Niro performance is mindblowing. the way he talks and move is just spot on. However if you have a weak stomach then you probably have to be ready to cover your eyes, because you know... it kind of like Deadpool, the gore stuff, only wrapped in completely different package. "
4219," This is the opportunity DC has been waiting for.
"," If there is any one movie that could help rebuild DC's image in the eyes of so many enthralled with the MCU after so many DC disappointments, this is it. Seize it DC. Don't lose this possibly wonderful start to a possibly mesmerizing series!! "
4220," A masterpiece
"," I really liked this movie and if the times were different it would probably win an Oscar or two. Joaquin Phoenix is truly outstanding in this film and the scenography is perfect just like the soundtrack.
The intense music just added to the dread I felt while being insecure of how Arthur would react to stuff.
This is a movie worth seeing, maybe more than once.
Is this the best movie of 2019? I think we have a winner here yes. "
4221," Great movie made in my lifetime (I'm almost 40)
"," This movie is a heartbreaking testimony of the failure of various levels of our society. It speaks to cruelty, altruism, the misunderstood, the over-medicated, child abuse, judgement, bullying, mob mentality, mental illness, loneliness, trauma, neglect, ineffectiveness of our mental health care system, cognitive dissonance and poverty. There's more but just watch this, learn from this and cherish it. It's a pure tragic masterpiece. "
4222," One of the best movies since so many years
"," For everyone worked in this movie .. THANK YOU for this 2 hours and 5 minutes. After so many movies, a Joker came so that I can finally loved the year 2019 .. this movie was a masterpiece in every way, the character development was perfectly plotted and of course performed, the music and the general theme of the movie lets you feel the deep sadness in every laughter .. I felt this movie .. I lived in it .. I loved it so much .. I don't give a thought about comics or super hero movies .. but this Joker .. this was something else .. this was a true GREAT movie .. "

"," I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie. I've heard complaints about pacing or the first hour ""dragging on"", but those claims are likely by those expecting an action movie. The film did an amazing job showing Phoenix's descent into madness every step of the way, almost causing you to root for and empathize with the Joker. Joaquin brought new elements to the clown prince of crime, and this movie will sit atop my list for as long as I can see. "
4230," Speechless
"," ""I am without speech"", as Elaine in Seinfeld said. I was close to tears and the hair in the neck was standing straight up throughout the movie. This is a genius work. One of the most important movies ever. I think a person has to be empty and soulless to not feel and see what a masterpiece this is. Just watch it. It is beyond words, really. This is the movie this rotten evil society and system needs right now. Thank you Joaquin Phoenix for this pure genius portrayal of how it feels to be truly depressed and lonely. "

",
4235," Joker= A much needed Marvel.
"," For those who have been searching the 90s movies for quality stuff...JOKER is an absolute treat for you for us.
It so hauntingly and beautifully dangles the idea infront of us that how emotionally unstable a normal looking person can be, how the fear and agony of forlorness overpowers the human mind and how ignorant are we of those whom we claim to know...
It makes you wonder that somewhere at a particular moment while walking past some taxi stand, waiting in queue, parking your car or having a promenade you too have stood beside, walked and drive past a Joker....
Every once in a while you watch a movie that blows you away, leaves you in awe and stays with you forever...let JOKER be that movie. "
4236," One of the best performances I've ever seen. Puts others to shame.
"," I usually hate origin stories for bad guys. I don't need to know why they ended up that way. Prometheus in my opinion ruined the Aliens but Joker is something else. Jacquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Some scenes are just uncomfortable to watch and that's all down to him. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like the way 'requiem for a dream' is uncomfortable to watch it's the fact that it's played straight makes him so unsettling. As in this is not the Jack Nicholson or Jared Leto over the top super villians versions...this is a man suffering from severe mental illness turning psychotic and it's grounded in reality. This version could happen. That's the unsettling thing. Enjoyed trying to keep an eye out for any DC comics history references. Shame on all the people complaining and trying to censor this movie by saying its dangerous and glorifying the villians. It does no such thing........and by the way.......... it's just a movie. "
4237," Joaquin Phoenix killed it so good.
"," The Joker is not a role model. He never was, never will be. His actions aren't justified, and neither were they right. But before the make-up and purple suit came on, before the blood-smirked smile formed shape, and before he got crowned as the Clown Prince of Crime, maybe the Joker was human. Maybe he was Arthur. And Joaquin Phoenix as joker and this movie makes us feel for him. "
4238," Amazing
"," After seeing the trailer my hopes were sky high and, because of that, I was a bit worried how it would turn out. But, now that I've seen it, I can gladly say it did NOT disappoint. To be quite frank, it actually surprised me how raw and unsettling the movie is, even though I was expecting something around these lines. Joaquim is amazing the entire time, he's sad and depressed and you can watch the Joker growing inside him as the movie progresses. A few t√≠mes it feels over the top, like too many coicidences happening at once, but when compared with the greatness of everything else it just seems like nitpicking.
After the backlash this movie went through with the media and stuff, I'm thankfull it wasn't a disaster. 'Joker' is just as the movie itself, a survivor in a clown world. Go see for yourself, it's a dark take on a great villain, and it doesn't let you down. "
4239," Outstanding movie!! Acting is surreal!
",
4240," Braced for something else, but its about class warfare
"," ""Joker""
Portrays mental illness in a society about to explode with the divisions between haves and have-nots. I expected a movie like ""The Stand"".
This was better, like a disguise in title.....
Depressing in the beginning, it slowly builds understanding and perhaps sympathy of the focal character. It has definite ""A Clockwork Orange"" feel to it. Similar in dysfunction, similar in ultra violence.
Could the portrayal be the trajectory of the United States? "
4241," Haunting and captivating take on a villain
"," This is by far my favorite movie I have seen. I rarely go to the theater, but I saw this movie on opening day with a friend, as well as the day after with some different friends. Without giving away spoilers, this movie is atmospherically a psychological horror movie with no jumpscares. Even causal movie fans will leave the theater unable to stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>It's sad we don't get many movies like these. I will definitely watch it a third time when it comes out digitally. Don't watch it if you didn't enjoy Taxi Driver, or The Machinist. It is also not for children or people who are sensitive to certain topics. "

It's dark, sad and very realistic. It does a great job at showing the viewer, a story of a troubled mind, and answers the question ""What if the joker lived in our world. How would he have gotten there. What could push a person so far out, and hate society so much"".
The scary thing is, you can really relate to his journey.
Wonderful job everyone on the team of this movie.

"," Going into the cinema I expected to give this 8 or 9 out of 10 because I know Joaquin Phoenix is a 5 star actor and I read several reviews of this movie before, most praised the cinematography. I came out from it with a 11/10 if possible.<br/><br/>This is not just a movie. From score, story to cinematography, everything has been crafted so beautifully. But what struck me so hard is the acting, especially Joaquin Phoenix. I don't see him at all on the screen, Joaquin is totally disappeared. All I see is Joker, a character so complex and so real. From the legs shaking, sometimes hands tapping down to the way his eyebrow raising, it's a perfect Joker.<br/><br/>Now that the movie has ended, so is Joker. You would not see even a bit of it on Joaquin Phoenix. That's the epitome of great actor. "
4255," Go see it
"," This is understandably a split reaction for people because the movie isn't made for everyone. It's dark, depressing, and makes you question what is and isn't real in your mind.

The movie was incredible but deep! I loved the quotes said throughout the movie it gave the audience such an inside look on someone who sees so differently of the world because of what they've been through. The role was played perfectly I actually fell in love with Arthur and to the critics please remember it's not a Dark Night movie it's the beginning of the Jokers era. "
4263," The best film in 2019
"," Ok..so I never write reviews. Ever. Especially on IMDB where they kind of force you for a certain length, spoilers alert, and so on.<br/><br/>Anyways..if you're looking for an action movie, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. This is a piece of art. This is the best film in 2019. Or the best film I've seen in years. The acting, directing, cinematography, editing (colorist!!!), the score, the script, EVERYTHING is perfect.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix &amp; Todd Phillips are brilliant; each of them in their own way and role. Let the Oscars come their way!!! Amazing team and film. I've seen it 2 days back, I'm still haunted by it. "

4271," You Don't Get The Joke
"," Joker is a multi-layered film with many great elements put together. It's a psychological thriller and drama disguised as a comic book movie. It's something DC has done better instead of presenting a pure comic story, e.g. The Dark Knight (a crime drama) or Aquaman (action fantasy).<br/><br/>The first layer is one man's descent to madness. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully takes us into Arthur Fleck's journey day by day until he finally becomes the Joker. The tics, the change of personality, his liberation is so realistic. Phoenix disappears into his role and becomes Fleck. You don't see the actor anymore but the character. For this reason alone, Phoenix is deserving an Oscar already.<br/><br/>The second layer is the critique of society. Gotham is in shambles, everyone is out for himself, and the economy has gone south. What causes the viewers to sympathize is the lack of compassion because people like Fleck need help. In fact, I find the film a criticism on the lack of universal health care in the USA.<br/><br/>The third layer is the dearth of people sympathetic to Fleck. There are only 2 with one who actually lied and hurt him in past. With no support group, Fleck's condition can't be helped.<br/><br/>The fourth layer is the unreliable narrator Fleck is. You don't know which scenes are true. In fact, you don't even know if the entire story is true. Or is it really in Fleck's head?<br/><br/>Other aspects:<br/><br/>The cinematography creates a personal relation w/ the main character. It's in your face but not obtrusive. Everything seems like you're in the same room as Fleck.<br/><br/>The fifth music adds dimension to Fleck's descent. It's gloomy at first. It ends towards being menacing and frightening. It also adds to the delusion Fleck is in.<br/><br/>The screenplay is excellent. The story is slow at the start but goes faster towards the end. There are scenes which are frightening and tense but somehow elicit some inappropriate laughter like the door lock w/c Fleck's midget colleague can't reach.<br/><br/>Because I watched in a Dolby Atmos theatre, the sound was great. This was best when Fleck shoots people. It was shocking to hear a gun go off like you were in the scene.<br/><br/>The film's director deserves an Oscar for direction. The risky vision and concept paid off. This film makes you think because it makes you uncomfortable. Again, it's not just because of the violence inflicted upon Fleck and his pushback, but also the possibility of being a story made up in Fleck's head. You really don't get the joke.<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserves Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne, despite the limited minutes), Editing, Screenplay, Cinematography, and Musical Score. "
4272," Masterful, yet worrisome
",
4273," Phoenix has took the Joker to another level. THE HYPE IS REAL.
"," When the initial teaser trailer came out, 6 months ago or however long it may be, I was skeptical of this take on the ""Joker"". The final trailer for it intrigued me massively, and I thought wow, this actually looks pretty good. Then the initial reviews came out, the fact it had gotten a standing ovation in 8 minutes, surely it is all hype? Surely it isn't THAT good?<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong, Joker is a tremendous film, that is what sets it apart from other ""comic"" movies, this is not a great movie based on a comic character, it is a great film overall, period. Phoenix' acting is utterly stupendous, breathtaking, and worthy of an Oscar no doubt. The movie itself is dark, disturbing, gritty, and uncomfortable at times, and leaving the cinema, this is one of the rare movies which made me think about what I had seen in a deep manner. Can't wait to watch it again.<br/><br/>Joker. 10 stars. Masterclass. Phenomenal. "
4274," A comic book movie that isn't.
"," The Joker manages to be a depressive and sad drama while having some comic book references in it such as meeting Bruce and Alfred or Martha's and Thomas' death. We see Arthur trying to bring joy and happiness to others while society disappoints him. Than once he gets a gun to defend himself he uses it instantly. And he feels great for getting revenge on society. And after that came the bathroom dance scene. The moment he became the Joker. The moment he felt like being liberated. With the music, cinematography and -of course- Phoenix's acting it becomes a perfect scene. Next day his mother gets shipped to hospital. Than he learns about his mother being sick and that she dropped him when he was a child so all his misery came from her. He chokes her. He is truly the Joker now. After it comes my personal favorite scene which is the stairs scene. He is free from his pain. He doesn't feels guilt when it comes to killing but happiness. Instead of going up on the stairs like in the first half he is going down. The music once again doesn't disappoint. And finally the host show and the rebellion which I think everybody remembers. It was truly remarkable. My favorite 3 parts of the movie were: Phoenix because we can see through his body language when Arthur becomes the Joker. He becomes confident and feels great. Secondly: the music. It's kind of like the perfect mix between sad and depressive. And thirdly: the cinematography. I don't really know what to say about it but it was breathtaking. The movie was great altogether and made you feel bad for the Joker who is one of the biggest villains in the history. "
4275," A short review
"," In filim Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is standing in a decrepit elevator with his neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz) and her daughter. The lights are flickering, and the lift almost comes to a halt. In irritation, Sophie mentions that the building is beyond repair. She does the iconic finger-gun to the head, to show how hopeless the situation is. Arthur smiles.<br/><br/>The elevator begins to work again and they reach the required floor. Just before he reaches his door, Arthur returns the gesture. They part ways. She smiles understandingly.<br/><br/>There's nothing more to that scene. But it's uncomfortable. It makes you squirm, and you don't know why. But apart from the fraying mindset, it's a dark indication of the events that will follow in the film.<br/><br/>Joker, directed by Todd Phillips, is the origin story of one of the most baffling and iconic DC villains. Through the decades, the character has been given numerous flourishes, and each actor has brought something new to the villain. We've seen Cesar Romero's playful prankster, Jack Nicholson in Batman (1989) and no one can forget Heath Ledger's dark and sadistic portrayal of the Joker. Ledger's characterisation of the Joker in Dark Knight set a benchmark, which, it was believed, no one could touch. After the forgettable performance of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad, Phoenix brings the Joker to life again in a terrifying, haunting and unsettling performance.<br/><br/>It is the 1980s. There is an ongoing class war in the city of Gotham. The privileged like Thomas Wayne make paltry statements about poverty, while the ones pushed to the periphery of society like Arthur Fleck and his ailing mother Penny remain invisible. Arthur tries to earn a living for himself as a clown, but is ridiculed and beaten up. In short, he is at the hands of a system that cannot, or rather refuses to see him. And slowly, the thin mask of sanity that he struggles to hold to the world, slips throughout the film. A family secret hastens his descent into madness. The lines between real and hallucinations become blurred. It leads to a powerful climax, with an ending that rivals a black satirical comedy.<br/><br/>Philips has received strong backlash for making a film about inciting violence in 2019, a year when there have been more than 300 mass shootings in US itself. It was said to be the typical whitewashed story of a lone wolf resorting to mass murder, because he was shunned by society. When posed with the question about inciting violence, Phoenixhimself had left an interview as he later said that ""he had not thought about that"".<br/><br/>But is the answer so black and white? The Joker while attempting to humanise the antagonist in the beginning, doesn't glorify him. The twinge of empathy and sympathy dissolves through the film, and there is a sense of fear of the monster Arthur devolves into. The film also seems to be a strange warning of the dangers of unchecked mental illness and the effects it can have on an individual's moral, physical and emotional make-up.<br/><br/>The Joker is a one-man show, with extended cameos by Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. Phoenix is hypnotic and astonishing with his performance, which definitely does merit an Oscar. His eyes haunt you. They show his struggle with his inner demons. It's not often that you find an actor who can give you gooseflesh with every movement that is considered joyful, like dancing or just laughing. Phoenix pulls some demonic dance moves down a stairway; the same stairway where he had once walked alone and miserable.<br/><br/>His laughs as the Joker are anything but funny, and there are a variety of them. There's the high-pitched cackle, and there's the hoarse guffaw which hides the sobs. His laugh has no joy in it. It just shows how dead he is on the inside.<br/><br/>The film has its fair share of flaws of course, and there are some scenes forced into the film. Thomas Wayne's speech on poverty; another one where Arthur meets a young Bruce Wayne, which might confuse the timelines for a few, are among the problematic parts of Joker. The rich and elite have no greys in their personality, to the extent that some dialogues get repetitive.<br/><br/>The Joker is a deeply unsettling social commentary on a ravaging class divide, as well as a warning sign for mental illness. It is not for everyone. But it will definitely bring about a lot of conversation. "
4276," Best Movie I've Seen in a While
"," Now THIS is what I'm talking about. This is what I thought ""Venom"" was going to be and I so wish it was. Joaquin does an amazing performance with so many subtleties that make his character complex and intriguing. The story has so many twists and turns and can be interpreted in many different ways. Me and my husband are still talking about what it all meant a day later. Don't read any spoilers! Best to go in blindly and pay close attention. The only reason I rated 9 instead of 10 stars is for the pacing of the film. Both me and my husband felt that the first half was a bit too slow while the second half seemed a bit rushed. Otherwise it was an excellent movie that will for sure be remembered for many years to come. "

"," To be honest, I only went to see this done over movie, because Loaquin Phoenix was in it, boy was I surprised! If you have ever known persons with Pseudobulbar or Schizophrenia, you know how the media usually depicts it wrong or goes overboard with it; however ""Joker"" gets it right in my opinion. A man in a society trying to do the right thing, taking care of mom, keeping a job, being a productive member of society... Pushed and bullied and having the things that make one sane stripped from one, causes chaos in the mind, they got it right! Overacting; NO WAY! Every scene spot on, the story, dialog, graphics, acting, directing, videography, production, makeup, etc... I rarely root for ""The Bad Guy,"" this time is an exception. Well done everybody, well done! "
4280," Finally a good movie
", Thank God someone had the balls to make a dark film that's not trying to make some political statement. You will come put disturbed and confused but at the end of the day it'll make you think about the descent of madness. The reason I give it a solid 9 is because I don't find it to be a rewatchable film. It's something I'd watch a a third time but certainly for a second. Worth the watch 
4281," Don't listen to RT or movie Critics

"," A combination of three top movies taxi driver, king of comedy and the six senses. those who appreciate Avengers movies will be disappointed. if you are under the age of 30 you should not go because you will not understand it and will not like it because joker has no superpowers. an interesting scenario full of realism that I haven't seen for many years and I didn't think Americans would do. I bet he'll win the Oscar. the problem is that those who appreciate real dramas (say almost the movie is inspired by real facts) will not go to this movie thinking it's fantasy as batman. comparing the notes given on imdb by Americans and the smaller notes given by Romanians shows the degree of culture between us and them. when it is a superficial movie like Avengers full of cartoons we give bigger notes than them.

Can't stop free speach thru dark comedy and satire. What a way to yell fire in a crowded movie theater.... Oh my! The only thing I didn't agree with was the white men portrayed on the subway would not have behaved that way to the young woman. At least not all of them even if one was drunk and acting like a jerk. One of them would have intervened. Or are they supposed to be ""white privileged""? Sorry, can't have it both ways. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing and deserves an Oscar. "

"," This was a fantastic movie. I was anticipating a preachy movie about society at large and instead seen a powerful film about the treatment of the lower class and how the public sees people with mental health issues. Joaquin Phoenix is the star of the show, and perhaps is the lead of the best character study film I've seen since ""American Psycho"". The colour pallet of the film was also very interesting and the directing as well as the cinematography was more than competent. There were even some nice soundtrack moments that really complimented the story. My only issues that it's a little overwritten at times and there is a scene at the end of the movie that seemed very forced into the story.<br/><br/>Worth the ticket price for sure and will likely be seeing it again "

4300," A modern time master piece!
"," In a time where we have 3 hour long movies full of CGI and fight scenes, there is one comic book movie that goes against the norm and tries to establish a new way of exploring the vast and complex repertory of characters this medium has to offer. Joker is a movie like no other, it is well shot, well acted and beautiful directed! This is the only movie that goes toe to toe with The Dark Knight as the greatest comic book ever made!!! Great job Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix, you have created a new cult classic! "
4301," Outstanding
"," Perhaps one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Often The Joker is portrayed as a top class gangster/ring leader in the prime of his crime endeavours. However, I find this story visceral in its way of creating a monster whose only way is down, yet becomes a martyr against bureaucracy. Those who have the most ambition, but have no where to put it and no avenues to pursue, fall down a path of madness to achieve what they want. And this story told that madness perfectly. An outstanding film and one that will stay with me forever. "
4302," Utterly Brilliant!

4303," Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix
", What a brilliant performance! I've seriously never seen a better character study by an actor. Mind blowing. 
4304," Better than I expected, but not the movie I was hoping for
"," When I saw the very first trailer for the Joker movie, I was disappointed. At first I thought it was going to be modeled after The Killing Joke, but that wasn't the case. I haven't been a great fan of Joaquin Phoenix before this movie, but I really feel he gave an Oscar worthy performance. He was the best part of the movie for me.<br/><br/>I wasn't really a fan of the trailer for the movie, but going in with low expectations I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was better than expected. I really loved the tie-ins to Gotham City and Batman, but I am not sure if they were meant to add to the story or just to provide some storyline connected to Batman.<br/><br/>Speaking of Batman, how could this Joker be the same one in the Batman storyline? At this rate, the Joker would be a feeble old man by the time Batman came into the picture. There also seemed to be a few messages being made here. Rich people are bad people. Poor people are hated by society. And society in general sucks.<br/><br/>I felt that this movie could have been a character study for any person with a traumatic childhood experience, then having several more bad experiences throughout life that push one over the edge of sanity. I kept asking myself, Is this a movie about the Joker, or any one who has been shunned by society while burdened with family issues.<br/><br/>When the movie was over, I sat in my seat trying to figure out if I liked the movie or didn't like it. To be honest, I am still undecided.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why, but there were people with young children to see this movie. I must warn that it does earn its R rating so please consider whether you want to take your kids to see this film. It is very dark and violent at times.<br/><br/>Overall, I would encourage people to see the movie. Joaquin's performance is so masterful, that it needs to be see onscreen.<br/><br/>I am scoring an 8 for this film because the music was very dramatic and helped create the atmosphere when needed. Also for Joaquin's performance. I gave points for being artful and for entertainment value. But, was it a movie that I would say is ""Outstanding""? Sadly no. "
4305," and the Oscar goes ...

When Arthur hits the change walking/dancing the stairs you can feel it The joker is born

4312," A tragic masterpiece that will be talked about for many years to come!!!!!
"," Where do I begin, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a man who is suffering from an uncontrollable mental affliction and occupies the lower echelons of society, through a series of events that lead him towards the path of becoming one of the most infamous villains in history: The Joker!!!!! All I have to say is this film is brilliant, disturbing, and of course tragic. Joaquin Phoenix brings an Oscar worthy performance throughout the whole movie as we follow his descent into madness. The soundtrack by Hildur Gudnadottir is a masterstroke, giving you this sense of sadness and horror as it plays throughout the film. Lawrence Sher's cinematography is absolutely stunning showcasing Arthur's world as ugly, fractured, yet strangely beautiful. And finally, the direction of Todd Phillips, along with his screenplay with Scott Silver, bring all of these elements together to portray a haunting tale of how a man with a fragile mindset can be turned into a monster by an unforgiving and corrupt society which won't be forgotten anytime soon.

"," After watching it, the reason why the PC SJW ruling class of Hollywood hated it was crystal clear to me. The movie depicts an Antifa-like mob destroying the city, clashing with the police, totally resentful and picking on regular citizens. Anarchists, they have always been. They're not into justice or equality, they wanna wreck things as if life was nothing but a joke. Mob rules Gotham and Antifa rules Portland. Arthur Fleck is the cathalizer. I wonder, if the movie was about a deeply perturbed woman, who inspired havoc amongst citizens, would it be condemned as this movie has been or would have been held as empowering and brave? "

If Joaquin Phoenix does not get Best Actor Oscar then the Academy deserves a visit by Arthur Fleck!. Definitely among the 10 best ever from any country and any language.

I don't care if this inspires world violence or not, it is a masterpiece. This Is art. This is going to be one of my all time favourite psychological thriller movies. I don't believe the controversy. It won't inspire mass murder or terrorists. It is fiction. It is a realistic drama and character study about what creates an unstable man. I'm not a super fan of the Joker, but I must say, DC better keep doing movies like this. "
4334," Amazing and dark
"," Wonderful and bleak and a dissent into madness and it leaves you unsettled, which is exactly what you want and should expect from a killer clown "
4335," A physiological thriller that leaves you wanting more from Joker
"," In summary this film was enjoyable and felt like something I haven't seen that frequent coming out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's effectively a character building thriller that takes you on an emotional exploration of the most famous Villian in DC history. The tone of the film is very slow and dark, it takes time to draw you into Arthur's life so that you can 'relate' to him and understand why he makes the decisions or acts in the way he does. This happens for the first hour of the movie before the pace quickens and the audience get what they came for - a dark DC character losing his mind and inflicting pain on anyone who disagrees with him.<br/><br/>Joaquin is very good in it and the holes in the story line that are encountered throughout you almost forgive because of his fantastic performance.<br/><br/>The only major criticisms for me was the involvement of the Wayne family felt forced. I don't think a single person in the cinema thought he was Bruce's brother so it didn't need to be his motive for finally pushing over the edge and going insane. Him being lied to by his mother following being treated badly by everyone would of been a fine way to progress the character to breaking point.<br/><br/>It also had a massive political agenda behind the rise of the Joker which felt flat. Gotham always had problems, Arthur Fleck shouldn't of been an influence at that level - it should of been as he became the crime lord that he gained support and appreciation from others.<br/><br/>Please don't let Robert Pattinson anywhere near this movie.<br/><br/>8/10 for me and will watch again when released from cinema. "
4336," Very nice one
", It's very good movie however the only mistake I see that the joker age shouldn't be that old as not have great age difference between Batman and the joker 
4337," Unbelievably good!
"," Ignore comic book fans hating the story change, everyone calling this a masterpiece is right. "
4338," A dark, gritty and tragic take on Joker's backstory!
"," The movie Joker centers around a man Arthur Fleck who is disregarded by society. The actor Joaquin Phoenix who portrays the character is phenomenal and definitely the best Joker after Heath Ledger. Joaquin Phoenix should definitely win an Oscar for his performance as Arthur Fleck aka Joker. This movie makes you actually sympathize with the Joker character and look at him differently. It is not surprising that this movie was well received by the audience and got mostly positive reviews from critics.<br/><br/>How this movie plays out is not traditional. It is a character study of Arthur Fleck also known as Joker. The movie is set in the past where Bruce Wayne is a young boy and both of his parents are still alive. Arthur Fleck was the main protagonist and antagonist of the movie. He had a scene with Bruce Wayne and confronted Alfred. In this universe, Arthur Fleck was adopted by Penny Fleck and she saw how people abused him. It was quite shocking that Arthur Fleck may have been Thomas Wayne's illegitimate child, but that rumor turned out to be false.<br/><br/>Joker is a terrifying and tragic story about Arthur Fleck who had a traumatizing experience growing up and was abused due to his mental state and his abnormal laughing condition. The movie is a definite must watch for Joker fans who loved Heath Ledger as the Joker in the Dark Knight. "
4339," Beautifully Depressing
"," Joker was beautifully depressing like a Street Car Named Desire. It was by no means a Super hero film which I loved about it. Rather than formulaic dog shit, it actually did something different, dirty, grimy and succeeded in being hopelessly dark, captivating and Phoenix was brilliant. This is definitely the darkest Joker you will ever see and reminds me of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, The Tenant and Requiem for a Dream mixed with a Scorcesse/Tarantino Pizazz. "
4340," Masterpiece
", As a viewer and a fan of Joker this was a amazing movie. Joaquin carries this movie. What a performance from him. Simply outstanding. I thought no one could pull off a Joker after Heath Ledger in Dark Knight but I am happy to be proven wrong. This is a must watch. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his performance. And please ignore the stupid controversy created by pathetic media. 
4341," Joker delivered
", Origin stories vary from either good to very bad and should be burned in fire. This one delivered on all fronts. It showed the progression that he went through from where he was to what he would become. It touched on his childhood and how that helped shape who he would be. Everything connected. It clicked as it should. It told a gritty and dark story. There were moments you're thinking why is this happening... just give it a couple of minutes and that reason is told. This Joker is one you want to watch. You almost want to root for him but then you remember he is the bad guy so while you don't root for him you understand him a lot better. Take a couple hours out of your day and enjoy this one. May even enjoy it a second time. 
4342," Great movie!
"," From the beginning to the end of this movie, it was so well explained how he became who is now, the joker! There were parts that had me and my daughter surprised, like the Bruce Wayne part and his mother. I didn't expect the movie to be the way that it was, and I'm so glad we went to go see it. It was such a good movie and it kind of reminded me of the actor who played the joker in Dark Knight. "

4345," Oscar goes for Joaquin Phoenix !
"," This film was a masterpiece. Especially the laugh of Joker. This time he will get the oscar, it's 100%. "
4346," Best cinematic achievement of the decade
"," This Joker was a masterpiece. The way Todd Phillips unfolds the tragic story of Arthur Fleck is a piece of cinema that can only be explained by emotion. The essence in which the Joker as a character is warped and distorted to be the award winning, no doubt, performance of Joaquin Pheonix is truly exceptional and outstanding. From the mis en scene to the minor green tint throughout the whole movie, each frame is to be cherished by the audience. Todd Philips should be internationally recognised and applauded for his story telling in Joker. If you emphasise for a villain who has caused a whole city to riot and to murder, either you are sick, or Philips' creation has been successful. Heath ledger isn't comparable to how amazing and twisted this performance was. If I was to recommend any movie, it'd be 2019s shock film Joker. Physiologically thrilling and heart throbbingly emotional at the same time, this movie has made 5 stars in my opinion. Congratulations Warner Brothers. "
4347," Legendary performance by Joaquin Phoenix
", A true piece of art. I had the privilege to watch this movie today. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Joker. We all have seen Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight. I thought Heath Ledger's performance was twisted. Joaquin Phoenix performance is even more twisted. If he doesn't get an Oscar then I'll stop watching movies. He has put his heart and soul in this performance. Don't believe critics words. This movie has to be watched in a movie hall. At the end I was actually in tears. It would be sad if someone else is given Oscar instead of Joaquin Phoenix. This has to be the best origin story ever told. I don't have words to describe this movie. Still reeling under the effect of this movie. Request all to watch this movie. This is Joaquin Phoenix's best word till date.

I got out of theatre, went home slept a bit and even after 12 hours,my head still remembers the vivid details of the movie. It leaves a lasting impact. Though the movie is great. I gotta say. This movie is a single shot, it wouldnt be continued to dc universe. Lastly if you have not watched this movie you are missing a piece of art that would be remembered for ages "

"," Joker is a masterpiece, Joaquin phoenix acting is excellent,on par with heath ledger performance also robert de niro was so good in this movie.
It is not like any comic book movie you have ever seen, first and foremost it is R rated,It is a dark origin story of one of the most twisted characters in comic book history,It is heavly influenced by Scorsese films like taxi driver,The Score the cinematography,This movie is beautiful,you can pause the movie any second and there will a great frame you could hang on your wall,my only complaing in this movie is that the pacing somehow is odd,there is scenes where it hypes you but then slow down,which I understand because the movie grounded itself in a realastic story,so don't expect joker walking around and killing people from the first minute.
Totally Recommend "
4350," IncredibleüÉè
"," This film was incredible I love the tie ins to taxi driver,king of comedy and the killing joke. Joker has been surrounded by controversy some saying about its violence and it being sinister it that is a load of crap and it should not make you reconsider seeing the film. Joaquin Phoenix knocks it of the park with his performance possibly Oscar worthy. If you are expecting a classic superhero film it's not what you will expect this film gets you thinking it's very psychological. This film was so good in some ways I do wish it was an 18 but the joker is an incredible film it's proud of what it is and it is the best superhero film of the year "
4351," Epic!!
"," The critics are so very wrong. This film is stunning from start to finish. Everything is on point, the style, cinematograghy, acting, music score are all phenomenal. I really enjoyed viewing the film from the perspective of Arthur, his journey was our journey. His unreliable narration was really engaging and I felt constantly on edge.<br/><br/>Perhaps this film glorifies violence in the way that every action film does. This is a film about the Joker, there's going to be violence and depictions of mental health, which in my opinion were grounded in realism. I don't see people complaining about John Wick, The bourne identity, James Bond, the godfather, pulp fiction, goodfellas, American Psycho, kill bill, django unchained etc etc. I get the point but I dont see how its any different in this movie than the rest. "
4352," Masterpiece
"," I was concerned about the hype and rarely put a review on IMDB. But this time I was just astonished by the performance of the Joker. You can feel the stress, anxiety madness, sadness, basically all the emotions played by an actor at the best level. Even his body seems having pain and sadness for the entire movie. Disturbing and amazing at the same time. Just a Masterpiece. "
4353," We need more than a movie we need a series of Joker films
"," We need a sequel of this phenominal origin story of the darkest villian ever.
Hats off to Todd's direction and the performance by Joaquin is breathtaking. This is best acting directing combo I have seen in recent years.
The cinematography is so beautiful that's I got completely hooked.
And making it R-Rated did the complete justice to this movie. We wouldn't grasp the darkness of Joker's character if it wouldn't be an R-Rated.
Some might argue that it's depressing. That's because the acting and the story is so amazing.
I was shocked that the movie is about a villain and I was feared that without a hero. It won't have to show but the character development of Arthur to Joker is really an amazing journey.
Besides, some scenes are so intense that you won't move your eyes from the screen.
The music was also wonderful and dark ofcourse.
Joker is spoussed to be the most dark, psychopathic, terrified, and weirdest villain. And Joaquin's Joker went beyond from all these villainous characteristics.
I truly hope that WB must think about making a spin-off series of Joker. "

4356," Best movie of the 21st century
"," From the moment the movie started, it was dark and it got darker which each segment. Over the years we have gotten full fledged jokers never an origin where we actually get to see why he became joker. I'm really glad mr phillips took up the mantle in doing this film because we really needed a change from the campy, over the top, predictable, cheesy and kid friendly cbm's we've been getting esp. from marvel. You do have people out there who are interested in serious contents that challenges one's belief. This movie isn't glorifying killing or incels it shows you how society can help shape disenfranchise individuals. The fact that critics are outraged over this, has led me to be believe the director has achieved his motive(by creating a thought provoking film). The critics are proving todd's and joker's point about society. This is top tier movie and DEFINITELY one of the best movies ever made esp. in the 21st century. The best movie of the year.....It's right up there with Dark Knight if not better. "

After the movie finished, everyone remained in their places, speechless, did not know what to do, what to say. I had the same reaction. This movies is impactful, deep, strong, and obviously has an Oscar-winning acting by Joaquin Phoenix. Days after seeing the movie, I'm still thinking about the movie. "
4359," Send in the clowns!
"," Excellent casting, wonderful directing. A lot of thought has clearly gone into every scene. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. Music works well. All in all, a very good piece, yet not your average comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>To those saying there's too much Joaquin in it: this is a character study and much of what we see is through Arthur's eyes.
To those commenting on Joaquin overdoing it: he plays a mentally unstable character, yet manages to portray every feeling in a believable way.
To those complaining there is too much drama, too little Joker specific mayhem: this is the becoming of.
To those saying it's depressing: yes, living with a mental illness is depressing. And no, society does't do much to help. (Do you never see impaired people being ridiculed in real life?)
To those commenting on how Gotham is dark: why was there a need for Batman, remind me?<br/><br/>For the critics: get over yourselves. "
4360," A masterpiece with an epic ending
"," The movie has a very dark atmosphere, which is somewhat iconic for the DC Universe. It started a bit slow, but there is no lack of action or twists in the movie and as I mentioned in the title - the ending was simply epic. I like the way Joker is portrait as some sort of a dark Messiah. 1 goof though I noticed - When he shoots those 3 douches in the metro, there were a few extra shots fired from a six shot revolver. Definitely not a movie for every one. A strange mix of extreme violence, dark humor and touching moments which kinda make you sympathise the charter.
All actors preformed perfect! "

Holy hell it was good. Now before I get into the the obvious choice, I just want to bring Robert Di Niro who I thought was absolutely amazing in his role with such a little time given. With that said it is Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this film. I have seen most of his film from The master to the gladiator. And with this film he has cemented as one of the best actor to grace the screen. He is absolutely hypnotic in the role that you began to cheer for him.

"," When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I admit I was very concerned that Joaquin Phoenix would be reinterpreting Heath Ledger's defining performance. Or worse yet, imitating. Now having seen it, I can say that my concern was fake news. Phoenix provides a fragile, entirely empathetic while horrific character study that dovetails perfectly with Heath Ledger's performance. It isn't a shadow, but you can see pieces fall into place that set Joker's trajectory and that of Gotham itself as well. I recommend you ignore any haters and see this movie. See it for what it is and see it for the mythos it builds upon. This is not a comic book/superhero movie. But it is an extraordinary film in every regard. "

4381," Too stunned, too disturbed, too excited, too moved, too overwhelmed, in every good way possible.
"," On the contrary to some critics' concern that this movie promotes meaningless violence, Joker does not glorify violence; it instead beautifies insanity with bittersweet and painful sufferings all attached to it, overwhelming the audience with unresolved feelings they never knew existed inside their past dreams, disappointments, aspirations, despair, hope and hurt. Don't be mistaken: Joker does not sugarcoat it or even set aside pains that come from years of abandonment, abuse, mental illness, severe depressions and disorders, and most painfully, the exhausting cycle of daily life after another. Instead, it takes it all in, put into beautifully stark, if not disturbing, images, with captivating soundtrack and music that chills your back even hearing it again long after the movie has ended, like a dark whisper, a reminder that the line between tragedy and comedy is not a line at all-because life is both, never less. Joker does not justify violence, but it attempts to get the audience to see a man's transformation from already troublesome life into the end any shred of sanity he has maintained. "

"," Yet again, Phoenix offers a quintessential, idiosyncratic performance, whereby the audience should be rendered disquiet and thrilled, simultaneously. The sheer perturbation of his act further augments Phillips', ""Joker""; and the contrariety of pain and exuberance clash with one another, engendering this psychotic, iniquitous character. The picture is intriguing in its consideration of the origins of Arthur Fleck (Joker), whom burgeons into the devil of Gotham City. The immensely - IMMENSELY - dark display instilled myself and, as it should, others into loving the persona of Arthur Fleck, with his uncontrollable, volatile behaviour; and, of course, the sporadic laugh: ""HAHAHAHA"". Phillips brings us a brilliant movie, with Phoenix ultimately completing it. Could this, finally, be the Oscar win for Phoenix, he so deserves?<br/><br/>Initial rating: 9.1/10 "

BUT after watching this film with the writing, Directing and sublime casting of Joaquin Phoenix &amp; his portrayal of The Clown Prince Of Crime I can honestly say as much as I love Heath's Joker, this take on the Joker is PERFECTLY EXECUTED, it's the most sinister, dark, twisted, profound, hilarious and more importantly most accurate version in my opinion. He deserves an Oscar, this film is FLAWLESS!!! "

"," Ledger may have set the benchmark for this fictional villain. But Phoenix has just delivered a flawless performance. His take on Joker is immense and is Oscar worthy. In fact if he doesn't win an Oscar for this perfect acting I'll be stunned.
Forget what you know about Gotham batman and the history of DC.
This is a story of a failed comedian who is essentially a psychopath. It's a shame Phoenix only wanted to do a one off movie on the Joker, because a trio of films featuring the Joker would give Nolan's take on The Dark Knight trilogy a huge run for its money.

4407," Outstanding
"," This film was unbelievable right down to the very last details. It was dark whilst also providing bits of humour to capture the jokers essence and Joaquin phoenix's portrayal of the joker came close to challenging heath ledgers. The film was a beautiful story of a man pushed to the edge by the challenges of a broken and decaying society and the cast, writers, director and crew all deserve to be praise for making such an outstanding film. "
4408," Masterpiece
"," The Joker tells a tale of a sane man in an insane world. His story is sad, filled with negativity and is very difficult to imagine. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was a ballpark and Todd Philip's direction was spectacular. DC has its eyes set on target, and hopefully, this continues. "

You really understand the character Joker after this film.
Not mutch action, no forced comedy just drama and character building. "

4411," Absolutely, terrifying, uncomfortable, and real.
",
4412," Believe the hype
"," Joker spoiler free review. So no surprise I'm another person singing it's praises. It's true, Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. I'm the person that always routes for the bad guys in films, psychos are always more fun to watch, but this left me with the moral dilemma is he actually the bad guy. I'm not advocating victim blaming in anyway but it did make it hard to feel sorry for the supposed ""victims""
The whole tone of the film felt very current in this capitalist, fat cat era we live in. The rich get richer and nobody cares about the little guy. Add to that the way society treats and deals with mental health issues and it makes for a thought provoking two hours. It's definitely a film of many layers and will need another watch to fully digest it.
I'm not the best person to comment on the whole ""DC"" of it all as I'm not a Batman fan, so it's best I leave that element to someone who is but I was fully immersed into it by just knowing the bare minimum. I could have happily have watched it for another hour. Believe the hype. "
4413," Joker is as good as I hoped
"," If you're interested in a movie that shows you the world of the Joker that's never been showed before, then this is it. Joaquin Phoenix portrays a very good version of the Joker. How he became the person he became, what drives a mad man to the brink of insanity, what makes you a crazy person?
This movie nailed it! Just when I felt that the pace was slowing down it picked up again.<br/><br/>Metacritics giving this 58? Politics and nothing else. People applauded at the end of the movie, which I haven't experienced since I saw the Gladiator on the day of the premiere. "

"," I loved it. It was shot beautifully, the music, the tones, the emotion, everything. Now, I have to say I am not a fan of Superheroes of any sort or anything related to them, but this is a story on its own. Just forget about the hype, the previous jokers and everything you have seen and watch it and let it fill you with that intense mixture of emotions. I rate it 10/10 because of the way everything goes so well together in this film on its own. I don't necessarily think its one of the best films ever made but for this theme and on its own its very well made. "

"," I watched Joker today. I was expecting a lot from Joaquin Phoenix. He didn't disappoint.
He has really studied the flaws of a mentally disturbed person in a heartless society and portrayed those insecurities to perfection.
The direction is top drawer as is the script. The film tilts its hat at several of the past portrayals of the Joker in a subtle way.
I believe this film actually beats The Dark Knight to the No.1 DC film and quite possibly one of the best all time films.

But the well directed tension, the cinematoraphy and Phoenix's A-maaazing performance take it to a whole other level. One thing I can't decide on is how much I liked the last scene. On the one hand I found it a bit underwhelming compared to the scene that came before it that could have been a good finale, on the other hand I think it helped ease the feelings of distress that had gathered up in me at that point.

4437," Spoiler Alert ! Almost Perfect, I still thing something missing. But it's truly a Masterpiece.
"," One of the most powerful hero you can watch on screen is Batman. You already know B-man vs Mr.J is the thing on every film, every animation movie, every game about Batman. Today, the biggest villain of DC show the world how truly who he is. This film really make us feel like on a trip to the land of depressing.
Fear, desperated, disregarded by society and struggle in vain. Grow up with a bunch of lies around him, anti-social not what he want, but if he don't fight back , he will drown in the lees of Gotham. Then, he become a demon and make violence actions make all of us feel aghast at the end of the movie. Psychological developments of Joker is so smooth. Frenetic, chaos and enticing. At the moment he make that sign to Sophie, i'm sure it is the key to unlock the way we want to see at Joker. Heath Ledger would be proud of Joaquin 'bout what did this day. A standalone story cleverly integrated some scenes everyone know into this Film, make it related to bigger picture in DCU. It will be darker after this. Brilliant movie - breathtaking, always try to assume what meaning behind all stuff. Especially remind us be kind to one another .' Thanks WB for this. Hope Joker can be more obsessed in the future. "
4438," Just Amazing.
"," I'm literally speechless. I cannot describe this amazing masterpiece in any other words. It's just Brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix is a Talented Actor he DESERVES an Oscar for his Performance. The Story Amazing, The Theme amazing and The Score! Oh my goodness it sent chills down my spine ! All this crap going about encouraging Murder is all lies. Watch it yourself it's a Masterpiece. "
4439," Slow Burn
"," I cannot even find the words to describe this movie, especially the last act of it. Joaquin tore this role to shreds. I was very very afraid that it wouldn't live up to the masterful trailer, but the journey you take with Arthur is so engrossing that by the time you get to the end, you want more.<br/><br/>And for an origin story to do that, world-build, character development at its peak, neutral stance on political topics, topped with Joaquin. The late night talk show scene is the Joker I hope to see more of in any kind of way.<br/><br/>It definitely takes its time building but by no means is it boring at all, especially when you get to about halfway through. It all makes perfect sense. In reality 8.5/10. It reminds me of ""Batman Begins"" the perfect origin. "

But even before that with the sort of slow build-up it's impossible to take your eyes off the screen! Also I must say I feel like I can't say this is better that heath ledgers joker but phoenixes is just a whole different beast and is a sight to behold 
4442," Did you get the joke?
"," I still remember the excitement I had when I saw the Batman, I was 10 years old ,then saw it for more than 5 times throughout my childhood years and every time I saw it I couldn't find a reason why the joker is so evil but that didn't mean I lost the excitement. The dark knight was released and Micheal Caine or Alfred gave some reasons to the joker evilness ""some men aren't looking for any thing logical like money, they can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch The world burn"".
When I watched the joker yesterday it added more reasons to his evilness and unpredictable doings with challenging performance compared to the deceased Heath Ledger. The joker performance by Joaquin Phoenix added a new approach to the character, starting from his laugh, posture and attitude down to his inner conflict. The protagonist journey from Arthur fleck to joker shows how society can have a massive impact on Arthur descend into madness also giving another reason to the hatred for the Bruce Wayne family. It's not a joke to hurt someone's feelings and it's not a joke to think that you're infamous by making a couple of dollars.
I don't agree or disagree with the joker but I felt so bad about our humanity and what we could say or do that turns one of us into a criminal and if something happens to any human being rich or poor known or a nobody we should all care.The joker is astonishing and a wake up call for humanity ,Joker ""some people will get the joke and others won't"". Before I watch the movie I thought it's a tragedy but after watching I realized it's a comedy.

I must say, this is the BEST I've seen. It is so intensely deep and brilliant! Joaquin Phoenix will get an Oscar, I'm most positive. His performance is more than deserving. I highly recommend! Can't wait to see it again! "

", Such a great movie and deeply storyline after long time a great movie I have seen. 
4449," Put on a happy face and must watch
", Performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating. 
4450," An outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix..But not an outstanding movie
"," Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his performance in this movie..But the movie hadn't reached what was expected from it.
Tod Phillips did an excellent work in directing but this movie has what's called typically lazy writing..How can be murdering 3 random guys who happened to be working for Wayne interprises in a subway train by an anonymous guy wearing a clown mask be a spark for a revolution and riot?..The killer didn't even know them or what they were working.. The question is why people consider him a hero and a symbol for their riot?..Why they even criticize Thomas Wayne for sympathizing with them?.. It was an attempt to make the movie darker and the atmosphere of this society so dark but It failed.
Also considering the movie R-rated was just another propaganda from Warner Brothers..the violence scenes in the movie aren't that savage..there's no so offensive words and no reason for Rating it as R.
The 2 hours runtime for the movie was short for the events and the story..this movie deserved at least extra 20 minutes to give its best.
The movie is a mixture between Taxi Driver and V for Vendetta so there's not so much creativity in the idea of the movie.
Most of the movie is a buildup to be joker..It's not like any comic book movie..It's more about depression and psychology.
The joker here has no plan no purpose the filmmakers make the people use him as a symbol not a leader for the riot.
Finally..Being a psycho or a failure or abandoned by society or having bad time doesn't give you the right to kill people who bother you and cause chaos "
4451," Outstanding performance
"," Joaquin delivers again. Amazing performance. I love seeing the backstory of certain characters. It makes you really understand their actions, feel their pain &amp; adds some extra layers.<br/><br/>I didn't know whether to be frightened, or feel sorry for Arthur. That's exactly the feeling you should have watching a movie like this.<br/><br/>Amazing! "
4452," Dark, Scary, Real and Amazing
"," I will start with saying it's an ABSOLUTE BEAUTY. It's dark, it's real, it's powerful and bang on.
Do not take your kids.
The script is perfect, the story takes it's needed pace, the plot twists are awesome. And the acting is phenomenal. Joaquin is taking Oscar for this.
The movie touches the untouched parts of reality of current society and how it can drive a man crazy. The last 20 minutes are heart wrenching and phenomenal. The movie will leave you with a thought and make you see the harsh reality of current society. I'll just end this with saying: That's Life. A must watch. "
4453," Mind blowing
", It's an instant classic and a movie of generations there is a lot of quotable dialogues and great Well played scenes. Plus the score is amazing. 
4454," Possibly one of the best movies I've seen this year! (Possible spoilers!!!)
"," I watched this movie last night and left the theater with a ""holy crap...what did I just watch face"". This movie was truly amazing. I firmly believe some people are crapping on it because it is a mirror to how society is right now and that scares people. If this kind of movie isn't your cup of tea that is fine but we have to look at this movie for what it is. This isn't a marvel film, you don't have a ton of action sequences, or jokes every two seconds. I wouldn't really even call this a comic book movie, but it's still really good. What Nolan create with his dark knight trilogy was phenomenal and I know Nolan really tried to take comic book characters and ground them to reality, and to me the dark knight can't be touched, however this was able to bring a comic book character even more down to earth than what Nolan did. There were certain lines and scenes in the Joker that were so real it hurt. I'll break down a couple sections right now, I'm no expert critic by any means but I do enjoy a good movie!<br/><br/>Phoenix does an amazing job with this character...I wasn't worried given Phoenix's reputation in the business, but he really blew me out of the water with this one. I thoroughly enjoyed his performance. Phoenix really is the star here and honestly will probably be the only character I really remember from this movie (with good reason obviously lol) A lot of the other characters sorted faded in the background for me with the exception of Murray (SPOILER)(given the fact that Joker shoots him point blank on live television) and Thomas Wayne given the fact that he was just an ass in this movie. Which I don't mind that they did that to his character but the lack of compassion from all these characters was a really hard hit. Zazie Beetz character did display compassion in the apartment scene which honestly I was floored when I finally realized what was going on with her character and Arthur. It was honestly a really good twist in my opinion.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is slow, if you are accustomed to high action movies then you may be disappointed in this and find it to be too slow. I don't mind a slow movie when the storyline engages me and this story line engaged me.<br/><br/>Cinematography was beautiful, I don't have much to say here, whoever was in charge of that did a phenomenal job.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie was really good, as I mentioned above there were certain lines that were said that were honestly so real that it hit like a ton of bricks to me. This movie was really heavy, one of the heaviest parts was when you find out what happens to Arthur when he's a child because of his moms negligence, the abuse and being tied to a radiator...that hit hard and deep. It also was interesting trying to figure out what was real and what was in Arthur's mind throughout the whole movie. It was just really crazy.<br/><br/>One of the most disappointing things for me which I knew about before going to see the movie was that you really only see Joker as joker in full makeup and costume for the last 20 minutes of the film, although exhilarating really left me sad that Phoenix does not want to reprise this role. I know this is an origin story, and when I first heard that Joaquin didn't want to reprise this role I was ok with that, I liked the idea of a one and done situation, until I watched the movie! Now I want more! His last 20 minutes as joker was great, the ending of the talk show got me, when he was laughing in the camera, I was sitting there thinking ""that is joker"".<br/><br/>All in all this movie was phenomenal, some weak moments but I will definitely be watching it again. The message is clear and concise (not a message on violence!!!!) and everything was done great. Not perfect but everything I needed and wanted it to be. Todd Phillips did great and deserves applause and recognition for this movie!<br/><br/>Ps. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take your children to this movie, as I stated it is very heavy and rated R for a reason. (Obviously do what you want with your child, but I don't think it is necessarily a good idea to expose children to what is in this movie) "
4455," As one of DC movies, the dark tones aren't less. The best of this movie is Phoenix's performance.
"," Joker movie is a great movie. And Joker is a heavy character. So when we see a joker movie or joker character, we have to see the actor's performance first. Phoenix's performance is unique and surely gives the different taste from others' joker. The performance is outstanding and the music flows through the heart. So what do we need more? If you're the one who expected so much from joker movie, it's not your fault. The directing and performance are special. The story is good enough. And this movie gives me special taste of cinema like different and special you know. "
4456," Imitation is the best form of flattery
"," When I was in the theatre, the guy beside me kept moving his head the same way as the Joker. I think this is best compliment to the director and the actor. He also took pictures of the final scene. I hope he doesn't get too influenced by JP. I have a nagging feeling crimes will increase post the release and that I believe in a way is a homage and a curse at the same time. Giving any rating to the immersive experience this movie provides would be sort of an insult to the effort. Do yourself a favour, watch it with strangers in the theatre and don't forget to watch Meet the Parents trilogy after coming out to get this out of your head. "
4457," Best film of 2019
"," They did such a great job making this film, can't describe it.. Just go see the film. Best film of 2019 by far!! "
4458," This is not a Comedy!
"," For the ones who are rating this with 1 star, did you expect a happy lovely story? Come on, this is the freaking Joker. If you can't take it, or this is not your category film, don't watch it! "
4459," Joaquins acting here competes with The Master
"," It's not a 10/10. If you watch the trailers you can some what predict where the films going at a certain point. Great supporting cast especially if you are a fan of standup. The cinematography is great. Joaquin Phoenix can do anything. Without Phoenixs performance, the film might not of been able to pull the complex turns with the character in the way that was needed. I got the sense that he carried the movie and for the most part, kept it from collapsing on itself. "
4460," Wow just wow
", If you wanted a dark and gritty movie look no further than joker everything about this movie is superb everyone should watch this movie is one of those that leave you thinking in the end 
4461," JOKER: You Complete Me
"," I have never written a review on IMDb before this and I am inclined to write because this masterful piece of art deserves it. This movie explore the character in such amazing depth that this is the first time I felt actually scared from the Joker. In all the previous attempts, be it games, movies or animations. I've never seen the Joker being portrayed with such vehemence.
This is not a movie for the faint hearted stupid people who feel that this movie encourages violence. It shows the most brilliant account of how a society with no regard of people can create the most "
4462," I want to see it again
"," Got back a couple of hours ago from the opening performance of Joker at my local Cineworld. I had deliberately avoided reviews but saw this morning that The Guardian had described it as the worst film of the year. If The Guardian hates it then you can be sure the film is going to have something going for it. In this case I was rapt throughout. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was utterly outstanding and if he doesn't win the Oscar for Best Actor then it will be because of some political stitch-up. The movie is slow-paced but confident and self-assured with it. Unlike a couple of reviews I have seen, I personally thought the story-line was very good and I didn't see the plot changes coming except for the police car bit at the end. I should admit to not being a fan or knowledgeable of the superhero genre but have The Dark Knight in my top 10 films of all time. I also thought the cinematography was excellent and loved the soundtrack so stayed until the very last to see the track listings. To summarise, this is an outstanding piece of art which in the fullness of time will, I believe, become a cult classic. "
4463," What this movie deserve.
"," I can say that i'm really grateful that movies like this one haven't died yet. I waited so long for this movie, wishing not to be bad one. I went to the theater with so much hope because of the reviews here. I finished the movie in completely silence.. i really thought that i should see it again even though it was 2 am. I never really had this kind of feeling since interstellar. It's a masterpiece.. everything excellent and has been done with passion. Thanks Joaquin And Tod for this movie. I'm SPEECHLESS.
It's pure drama my friends just don't miss it go and watch it and put on a happy face, or silent one i could say. "
4464," Damn...
"," To me, Joker is always Heath Ledger, I mean, I never hoped (and wanted) anybody to pull the character Joker like him. There were none who could ordain the throne, but Joaquin Phoenix did the finest job. I mean, he was phenomenal! His madness, his sadness, his joker laughter-it's like Joker is someone from our real world and he is it, not Joaquin. The story was to the point, the direction was neat and on top of that, loved the ending! Can't wait to see how the dark knight will rise!
After Nolan' majestic The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joker is my most favorite movie about DC Universe. "
4465," Best Acting Performance Ever
", Must watch! Another good show by DC after Aqua Man and I would say it is even better! Mr Phoenix totally nailed it and his perfect acting skill definitely deserve Oscar Award. I had emotional feelings after I watched the show. It perfectly potrayed the sorrow and struggle of a depressed person. Looking forward to the battle between Joker and Batman in the upcoming movie. 
4466," In your face call for justice that upsets the corrupt elite
",
4467," Joaquin Phoenix performance is jaw dropping.
"," Everything in the film to me was amazing. The Cinematography ,soundtrack, story line, and of course the strong acting of the characters, and especially Phoenix's performance that of course steals the show. The soundtrack of the movie was perfect, everything mixed together perfectly. I enjoyed this movie so much, that I ended up making an IMDB account just to rate it. Thank you to everyone involved in this movie. "
4468," Outstanding!
"," Joker is one of the most outstanding dramas of this year, one of the most powerful comic book films ever made, and one of the most amazing actor transformations for a role.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect casting solution. This actor is incredibly different in each of his roles, Joker is no exception. Perhaps even his the most striking role. He became the real fantastic bird that revived the character from the ashes left after the lost and stupid role of Jared Leto in Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>Look forward to 2020 to see Joaquin in the list of Oscar nominees for the Best Actor, to enjoy with the whole world, when he will speak his speech, standing on a stage with a golden statuette in his hands. "
4469," How can I judge Joker's action right or wrong ?
"," Joker is the only movie that worries me for the first few minutes. Usually, I always get at least one scene that makes me laugh. But this is different, this film feels very dark. I can feel the aura of both evil and pain at the same time. Although Todd Philips the director said that this film is not connected to other DC films, in fact even if connected it is still very connected at the same time it can be considered a solo film that deserves to be considered as a stage of Joker's appearance. I really like the storyline, which is slowly but surely breaking apart at the end. Throughout the slow flow of the path, we can not only feel the journey of life but also feel the social issues that exist and feel trustworthy so that we feel the Joker represents it all even though on one side the Joker's actions give a question mark. Actually what he did right or wrong? And those worries that make me worry what if people are inspired by this. Hopefully, as a spectator, we can sort out which is good and which is bad even though it is still a question or still gray about the behavior of the Joker that we know is sadistic and crazy. "

This is one of the most brilliant movies that should have never been made. Especially with the tension in the country. Especially right before Halloween. SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, AT SOME TIME WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE. Oh for most it will go over their heads, but, for some... For a few, it will ignite a pilot light inside of them. This is the type of movie that causes school shootings.
If you are not a spiritual person then you may not have experienced first hand or even believe in good or evil. This movie is a celebration of anarchy. The world is about to be introduced to EVIL GENUIS in a way like never before. "

Watching Joaquin Phoenix's descent into madness is incredibly uncomfortable, but incredibly well done.<br/><br/>Phoenix shines the brightest in a great cast. Down to the smallest mannerisms, Phoenix transforms himself into Arthur, a man that cant catch a break, and is hitting his boiling point. With an already spellbinding resum√©, this very well may be my favorite Phoenix role.<br/><br/>All in all, Todd Phillips has done a complete career-180 here and presents us with one of 2019's greatest achievements. "
4478," Joker
"," Realy thats something we not every year
Joker give you the best drama performance on the last 5 year "
4479," Crazy
"," This movie is absurd. Very well directed and shot. Extremely disturbing, bit very interesting. It may not be the movie this society deserves, but it's the one it needs right now. "
4480," You couldn't have asked for anything better....
"," When you think about Heath ledger... you sometimes wonder how he got into this chaotic state. ""The killing joke"" tried to answer it but this was altogether a new feeling. You feel for Joaquin phoenix but at the same time you don't comply with his behaviors. This is not the same joker that you saw earlier, you pity him, you cry and laugh with him. The acting and BGM standout and make it No. 1 nomination for Oscar this year. and critics who are saying that this movie will have bad influence on the society... "
4481," Amazing
", I watched Alitalia of this movie with my mouth open in awe. 
4482," A Hilarious Psycopathy
"," There is nothing more delightful than an orchastreted chaos!<br/><br/>Phoenix presents us a man who hasn't really existed for his whole life. The awfulness is a routine, as the happiness is completely absent, nonexperienced.<br/><br/>Thereby, we are forced to witness nothing but misery, due to an A. Fleck struggling to mitigate his own nature: the comedy within the artist.<br/><br/>When the one is finally able to give birth to himself, there are no more barriers to push him back. The society is no longer capable to disregard a man it no longer owns.<br/><br/>Put on a happy face...and enjoy a hilarious psycopath in his full glory.<br/><br/>That's all. That's life. "
4483," The true Joker was shown
"," I think it's disappointing that people are upset with this movie. This is who Joker is. A maniac. There was no true origin story before in the comics but Phillips did a way better job than what Tim Burton did. It was more realistic that he already had a condition where he couldn't control his laughter and became an outcast in society. It's way better than falling in green liquid for crying out loud. Ledger is good but has no origin story whatsoever which is disappointing. This Joker was truly insane. Ledger and Nicholson were rational and crazy.Phoenix was crazy to the bone. Phoenix created the best story of what DC wanted Joker to be, a maniac with no empathy. In the comics he doesn't have empathy for anybody.People who haven't read the comics are misinformed about who truly Joker is. A maniac who doesn't care about killing innocent people and wants to watch the world burn. I was waiting for this version of Joker to come out and boy did it not disappoint. Hats off to Todd Phillips and Joaqin Phoenix. This deserves an Oscar. "
4484," The Killing Joke!?!
",
4485," Bold and dramatic
", Dark and dramatic. I have loved some of Joaquin Phoenix movies in the past this one is Stellar. He turned into the Joker and owned the role. I think this is one of the best performances of his career. Oscar-worthy 
4486," Too realistic!
"," Alright, forget about the hype and remember that this joker is not from the comic. This is the journey of Arthur becoming joker in a very realistic world, may be too realistic sometimes. The two constants in the movie are Joaquin and Hildur (music) and they have done brilliantly. The convincing writing conveys how a so-called normal, moral guy can change into a monster. The laugh, walk, the foot tapping, the stairs, the elevator and other detailing in every frame is very effective. Although, I felt suffocating at times as I never really got into the movie's rhythm. Brilliant movie to watch in the theaters with Hildur's music. Although, if you listen carefully you can hear Hans Zimmer! "
4487," Fulfilled my expectations and went beyond them.
"," Amazing movie. Joaquin Phoenix went above and beyond with his interpretation. The music, the cinematography, well, everything gets you so involved in the storyline. "
4488," Truly a Masterpiece
"," It is not a superhero film, it is a film about a man based on comic books. It is not just a film, it is a character exploration, a true piece of art. And there is no right or wrong in art, it is how you interpreted it. Rare to see such king of film nowadays. Highly influenced by Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Arthur reminds me of Travis but he is misdirected, worse and moe terrifying. Joaquin Phoenix was astonishing. The they make Gotham was unique, more realistic, cinematography was outstanding. To be honest, I had a doubt Todd Phillips could make such kind of film but he nailed it, maybe this is the best of his career. The whole build up was so good and the final scene was goosebumps. Easily the best movie of this year. "
4489," Phoenix takes the audience on a journey into madness.
", This truly was a perfect film. Joaquin Phoenix takes the audience on a journey into madness. Phoenix puts on one of the best performances I've ever seen in movie history. It really felt like you were witnessing a man go insane. I had high expectations for this and it did not disappoint! 
4490," Great Full Stop.
"," I thought it was great alternate story for the ""Joker"". It dealt with hard issues and did very well present thing to the audience in a real way. I think this story showcased the basis of the Joker character and who he is, but also put him in a more real place, as in what he may look like if he really existed. Great Job. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix, and a Great Story/Plot. "
4491," Joaquim F√™nix Oscar for good!
", O have No words to describe how perfect the film is ! 
4492," Unforgiving and Brutal. Definitely a masterpiece
"," Its very dark, gritty and brutal. Even the funny scenes in the movie are during it's most violent scenes and you will have to laugh while feeling guilt.
Joaquin Phoenix has given an outstanding justice to the role.
It will make you sympathize with Arthur and you will feel a little bit guilty about it( any sane person should).
A perfect Joker origin movie. Hats off to Todd. "
4493," Absolutely insane
"," Watching the trailer 10 times before the movie, I thought that I knew the whole story, but the view has many surprises, with an insane performance of Joaquin, with a wonderfull script that make you fly into the jokers madness, but in a way that was never seen before.
Movie of the year "
4494," Brilliant, disturbing and epic.
", Fantastic movie. It's an origin story so if you are expecting Heath Ledger's ready to go Joker it is not that. Joaquin Phoenix is spellbinding. You can't take your eyes off him. Story is original with lots of twists and turns. Give Phoenix the Oscar now. 
4495," AMAZING!!!!MASTERPIECE!!!! UNIQUE!!!! one of a kind
"," What a performance!!!!!! Please sign Joakin for a sequel.
His performace, his movements, his reactions OMG..... He took the role to a next level. We though we are watching a movie from an old era. his adoption!!!!!!
If this doen't give him the Oscar the what????<br/><br/>A unique joker permormance. Nowhere close to what was seen before.<br/><br/>Whach the movie, you will not disapointed. "
4496," Most realistic movie in the fantasy genre
"," This movie feels like in the universe of Scarface rather than the city of Batman.<br/><br/>If you ever wondered how a movie on the comic's universe would look if filmed in the most realistic way, this is the answer, and this is why this movie belongs to the podium of most notable movies ever made.<br/><br/>Most villains in movies are just caricatures of a bad man who is bad just because, or they have just checkbox reasons to be villain, but it never goes deeper.<br/><br/>Here is a complex character with meat to him. He has multiple motives to become the Joker, but none is the entire story. It is the set of circumstances, as it is in the real world. He is not entirely evil, not entirely insane. A victim and victimary, just as it happens in the dog eats dog, real world. "
4497," That was insane
"," It's obvious that pheonix is also insane, you would have to be to pull off what I just watched. Wow "
4498," Wooooooo
"," If you're just not a fan of the movie I understand. But these critics are giving the dumbest reasons to why it's not a good movie because it's so ""controversial"" haha soft as hell "
4499," Joker is amazing
"," Don't go into this movie expecting the joker, it's about a man becoming the joker. This movie is really good. Joaquin Phoenix is the joker "
4500," Unlike you have ever seen
"," Holy crap! I can't believe what I just watched. The Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro is a telling not from the comic books, but how Arthur Flack became the Joker. This movie is simply amazing to watch. Joaquin Phoenix gives a Oscar winning performance. He commanded the screen. This movie is very dark and unlike I've ever seen. The graphic scenes are graphic. But it doesn't happen till close to the climax . There are shocking moments and it will you gasping. The movie is slow in the beginning but it picks up each and every moment. Now the debate will be after watching this movie. Who was the best Joker? Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix? I'll post that later on. People have said that this movie is not for kids? Well most of it is, the rest it is not. Go enjoy this wonderful, beautiful movie. My rating of this movie is 10/10. #thejokermovie #joaquinphoenix #robertdeniro #dcuniverse "
4501," Simply the best DC movie so far!
", Joaquin portraided the Joker perfectly and homages to other Jokers were also brilliant. Is it violent and dark? Of course it is. This is the must see movie.  This is an awesome movie! 
4502," So beautiful yet so messed up, loved it!
"," This was disturbingly a cinematic masterpiece, unforgettable and definitely without a doubt a great movie. I'm highly satisfied with the actors, soundtracks, beautiful visuals, and amazing plots and character developments. This should go down in cinematic series and will definitely be one of my favourite movies of all time. "
4503," Better than the hype
", Words cannot describe how incredible this film is. At the end of the movie everyone started to applause. This does not usually happen. If you are reading this; stop wasting your time and go book yourself a ticket right now! You will definitely not regret it! 
4504," Created an IMDB account to give this movie 10 stars.
"," I watch a lot of movies because I have a membership at the local cinema, but It's been a long time since I had such a great time watching a movie! "
4505," Joaquin Phoenix Wonderful
"," An engaging movie, Joaquin Phoenix plays a magnificent role and appears in almost every scene of the movie doing a great job! Pay close attention as one event leads to another, which results in a very good movie. "
4506," It's a Masterpiece of a piece
", This film has so many layers that you feel mentally perplexed at the end of the movie...The brilliance of the movie is letting the audience be the judge of the actions of the Joker...we has an audience have an active part in thinking about the actions taken by the Joker..unlike any other live action adaptation..We as a audience judge Joker through the lens of our own morality rather than the perspective of the Batman..unlike any other comicbook movie this film will make you think long after the movie is done....you'll feel like to take a mental shower after the movie is done...it's a must see film for any general moviegoer fan and it's a treat to the comicbook readers...Joaquin Phoenix as always delivers an Oscar worthy performance and Todd philips has genuinely surprised me by the way he has shot the film aka Cinematography..the movie in itself is visually stunning and the streets of Gotham have never felt so real.. 
4507," The creation of joker
"," The movie shows you what were the circumstances behind the creation of joker .
What changed him. But viewers will definitely feel the pain of Arthur as the story continues . Do not compare Joaquin Phoenix's joker to heath ledger's joker . Both of them are masterpieces and show two completely different phases of joker. "
4508," We Got What We Deserved !!!
"," I can't believe this movie exists.
If somebody told me a couple of months ago that Todd Phillips' ""Joker"" would actually be a personal drama that acts as a character study and social commentary while also making sure to be a film striped away from the Hollywood standards and stuff that most movies of the genre incorporate in addition to being exceptionally written, directed, acted and scored, I genuinely wouldn't believe him. This movie reminds me of two eras, the first one being the good old days of American cinema. It's obviously inspired from that period of filmmaking and I think it's needless to say how Martin Scorsese's filmography (most notably ""Taxi Driver"") has contributed to this movie actually being made. The second period of time ""Joker"" reminds of, are the 2000s when comic-book movies completely knocked it out of the park with Sam Raimi's Spiderman and Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogies setting the example of how to make a perfect comic-book movie if not a perfect movie in general. After that period was over, comic-book movies just became commercials for other movies, as the MCU and other studios trying to replicate its financial success, started making superhero movies for the sake of crossovers, sequels and...money. A movie wasn't a movie with beginning middle and end but a rather forgettable pop-corn flick that simply lacked a certain vision or quality. And then came ""Joker"". A movie that reminded me that movies based on comic-books can actually be relatable, visionary, groundbreaking and whole stories again. With all that being said I'd really like to wrap up the technical aspects of the film in order to get into spoiler territory. So, besides the amazing direction, brilliant writing, Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar worthy performance, the extremely suitable/haunting score and staggering cinematography that actually made me feel I was watching a movie shot in the 80ies, there's really nothing else to be told.
The movie is what we were promised...a character study. It truly stands by that. The camera stays with our protagonist for the entire runtime as we witness his transformation from a struggling everyday citizen to a vengeful murdering psychopath that despite the cruelty he displays in some scenes, he still has retained some of his human character traits unlike Heath Ledger's Joker who was more like a force of nature with no background or particular motivation in order for us to figure out what he was truly after. The movie opens with Arthur Fleck (our Joker) as he is bullied at work by a bunch of teenagers who harass and eventually beat him as he lays helpless on the pavement. We later see him at a psychiatrist's office where we actually understand what this man is going through, as he is tortured by an unknown disease that causes him pathological laughter when he is uncomfortable, disturbed or sad. The movie shows us this man's pain from the start as we learn that he's been a patient of some sort of asylum in the past and currently has to take 7 different medications a day in order to cope with his depression and mental illness. Phoenix does his absolute best to demonstrate Arthur's pain with the pathological laughter being chilling and masterful. I really bought the fact he was actually in pain while laughing his ass off. This condition is of great importance as it's an additional reason (maybe the most important one) for which the people that surround Fleck label him as a freak in addition to being one of the movie's most important plot points. He lives with his mother whom he cares for and dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian with his idol being Robert Deniro's character who plays one of America's most famous comedians and talk show hosts. Arthur is set up as an unreliable narrator from the beginning where he imagines himself to be on Murray's (Deniro) show with various subplots and scenes also being questionable, the most obvious example being his relationship with Zazie Beetz's character, Sophie who the movie implies he eventually kills for reasons that make perfect sense all things considered. The big twist is that his nonexistent father, up until that point is actually Thomas Wayne who currently runs for mayor. This adds a completely different layer to the story as Arthur is forced on a journey to meet his father. Thomas Wayne denies everything and reveals to Arthur that his mother is insane which leads him to discovering the truth about her who adopted him and at some point had allowed one of her boyfriends to abuse him which caused his mental illness and pathological laughter condition. This pushes him over the edge as he goes full Joker killing his mother which is the reason he also killed Sophie (Beetsz) who (as a single parent) would have most likely done a very bad job at raising her daughter in this gritty/cruel society, similarly to how his mother (who he now perceives as a villain) did. At last, he joins Murray's talk show after Murray himself released footage of Arthur trying to shine as a stand-up comedian, embarrassing himself in the process due to his laughing condition which leads to the movie's climactic outburst which truly is one of the best third acts I've seen in a movie due to the story perfectly building to it. The end didn't quite stuck with me at first but after considering it, I think it's implied that Fleck has been in that psychiatric ward, dreaming or narrating the events of the film to the psychiatrist with an early shot at the opening of the movie (where we briefly see Arthur busting his head on the door of a similar psychiatric ward wearing similar clothes) seemingly confirming that he might as well have been there all along (plus in both scenes he's talking to a psychiatrist so there is a thematic connection). Does this mean the events of the film didn't happen exactly the way we were shown or are they completely imagined by Fleck? I don't know but the movie is definitely setting itself up to be ambiguous since there are hints suggesting Arthur being adopted and abused by his mother's boyfriends could be lies as there is a scene in which Arthur picks up a photo of his young mother that Thomas Wayne had given to her signing ""Love your Smile"" on the background of the photo, implying a potential romantic relationship between them. Eventually, that is one of the things I love about this movie...the ambiguity. Did his mother adopt him and allowed his abuse or is Thomas Wayne really his father using his connections and power to cover it up? Have the events of the movie truly happened this way or are they completely imagined? I think Todd Phillips isn't going to share his thoughts on his true intentions any time soon and if you ask me...I rather never learn the truth.
All and all, ""Joker"" is pretty much like ""The Dark Knight"" in terms of how you take a movie based on comic-book characters and turn it into a genre movie that is as realistic as it is relatable. I'd also go as far as to say ""Joker"" is the exact opposite of ""V for Vendetta"" with both movies being two sides of the same coin. They're both standalone films with beginning middle and end as the main theme circles around the fascistic face of power and authority. ""V for Vendetta"" however, is a movie set in a futuristic, dystopian society that ends up having a hopeful and optimistic tone while ""Joker"" is a movie set in the filthy, overpopulated streets of a realistic past that ends up having a very depressing and pessimistic tone. As for the violence, the movie is not like most controversial movies (Fight Club, American Psycho, A Clockwork Orange etc.) that portray violence in a satirical way that sometimes is disturbingly cool. It is never satirical and it portrays violence as it is. It's not meant to be funny or cool by any means and the film is more of a warning for society that creates ""Jokers"" and less of an approval of its violence (it's actually not an approval at all). I think I've said anything I could. Clearly there are many things I didn't cover here as the movie respects itself enough to be complex and multilayered. As an enormous Batman fan and even more a movie fan, 2019's ""Joker"" has proven to be one of the best experiences I've ever had in a movie theater and I'm pretty sure this film is going down the road of becoming a classic.
EXCEPTIONAL: 9/10</div>"
4509," Brilliant Script & Phenomenal Performance
"," When I started watching Joker, I feared I might compare Joaquin Phoenix with Heath Ledger. I partially knew my fear was baseless, but Joaquin convinced me beyond doubt that he is the Joker. What Heath played is unforgettable and Phoenix took the cariacature to a different level altogether. The midget scene was beautifully delivered giving me a laugh creepily for the sheer situation they created. The script is painfully detailed to a maddening level. The transformation is phenomenal. One understands Joker's madness and perhaps starts to see a certain sympathy beget inside to see him kill in his pain. An almost urge to see him create havoc. That was the power of the portrayal. Do not miss!! "
4510," Extremely touching film with great artistry
", Joaqin Phoenix proved himself again.it was shocking and touching film.Mental ilness is subjected greatly.Amazing adult drama 
4511," Great movie
"," I walk into the movie thinking I would hate it , but it was great.<br/><br/>The only minor issue I had with the movie is the cliche scenes at the start of the movie where he is Beaten up for no good reason.<br/><br/>Shout out for a great cinematography ( it better win an Oscar ) &amp; the great song selection. "
4512," Chaos and chaotic. 100 stars for Joaquin Phoenix
", Watched it today in india and its released during Holidays in my state. Theatre was full. Connecting dots at the ending ofnthe movie was very good. Joaquin Phoenix Deserve Oscar. 
4513," Chaotically Phenomenal
"," As a bias Heath Ledger fan, and fellow Aussie. I had extreme high expectations of this film. But can honestly say those expectations were well and truly succeeded. This movie was executed so freaking spectacularly, I actually am lost for words. Joaquin is one of my all time favorite actors and this film just blew me mind. I'm shocked and honestly gob smacked at the performance. The plot line, so many twists and unexpected turns. Not to mention, as a long time comic book reader, the adaptation of the comic book Joker was outstanding. So different, yet exactly what the Joker is.
Best movie I have seen. Hands down. No joke. Pun intended. "
4514," Very slow
", R. Phoenix does great unfortunately the script is very dull and very slow! I almost walked out of movie like some did! I love movies and watch them over and over but I will not watch this one ever again! 
4515," Overestimated Garbage
"," I don't understand why a typical viewer would care about a cinematography great acting work of a dillusioned and psychopath. Indeed a masterpiece of a frick, a true and vivid depiction of a disturbing man's evil character and violence with an irritating laugh that spreads paranoia and chills to the viewer. It's just a very well mastered work of a drama and at some point justification of evil and criminal acts of a disabled man.. No action, no good story, no other heroes, not something special. And definately not for the young audience who were misled to think that they would watch some action adventure batman-like movie. Not at the slightest point..
Last but not least.. I believe it sends disturbing messages, justifying the evil to ""evil"" or just ""guilty"" people and TOO LONG for a movie of this style, a waste of time not offering anything to a person who just needs to enjoy themselves for an evening..
ps: I also feel that the poor actor after this film may suffer from the same or similar illness of the character he was depicting so truely.. "
4516," Slow and depressing
"," If you're looking for a fun Batman style movie, this is not the movie for you. It is centered around depression and mental disorder. Although the acting is worth 10 stars the movie leaves you sad and depressed. "
4517," Overrated
", Weird and boring nothing enternaining. I hated this movie 
4518," Joker is disturbing
", Joaquin Phoenix acting was brilliant but the movie is disturbing. A slow movie 
4519," Race to the bottom of obscurity
",
4520," He broke my ambition
", There is nothing to excite and focus Inventory of a very ordinary film I wasted my time on him and also there are scenes adapted from the movie Batman and the Joker ... In killing the presenter ... less than expected level 
4521," Waste of good film
", Phoenix may have excelled as a drug dependent slipping into a carte blanc rubber room but the movie itself was slow and torturous. I was looking at my watch 30 minutes into it. Wait for it on tv. 
4522," Believe the critics.
"," I was hoping for so much more. This movie is pure fantasy. Kind of a vision of how crazy lefties view America. Three 30 something guys in business suits harassing people on a train? When has anyone ever seen that happen?
The whole city goes crazy against rich people?
Black social worker, black love interest, black worker at the mental hospital. Hollywood just can't stop shoving diversity down our throats.
While Phoenix was very good, Ledger was much better and given a lot more to work with.
Just a blah movie. As one critic said, it's not fun, and it's not serious. "
4523," It's just- boring
"," Tries to hard to be pretentious, up its own for most of the movie, Phoenix is decent but not Oscar worthy "
4524," Good movie
", But nothing really special. This is not a 10/10 movie. Good acting but at the end it doesn't leave me thinking. This movie will not stay with me because it's an average movie. Realistic rating is 6/10. I gave it 1 because of all 10/10's. The score needs to go down. 
4525," Very slow and Boring
"," I can understand the rave reviews about Joaquin Phoenix performance, but that was the only thing that kept me in my seat for 2 hours. 4 of us went to watch the movie with a open mind which is hard in the first place as we all like different movies. Not 1 of enjoyed the movie, even to the point I kept getting asked how much longer by my son. "
4526," Really boring
", Nice drama story. Really slow and boring. I really don't know how it has so good reviews. I guess not enough reviews so far 
4527," Rubbish
", First of all let me start off by saying...rubbish this was not even a joker film I know it's not the joker we all know but this was not even a joker film the only reconizible bit about it was his laugh it's just basically a man dressed in a clown suit...stupid it was that terrible that I left the cinema about an hour and 20 minutes in I let it go on that long because hopefully the movie would get better but it did not who ever directed this movie should be fired 
4528," Just another overrated supervillain movie
"," Apart from A-Class acting, the story line of the movie is very basic and linear. I think I've expected way too much from this movie but it turned out to be just another in line. "
4529," Not worth the hype
", Dont waste ur time or money. All the hype not enough action took to long to get to the point. 
4530," Worst movie ever made
", This is the first time in my life I have ever walked out of a movie I actually asked for a refund. Horrible. Don't waste your money. 
4531," Very slow and pathetic movie
"," Boring and too slow movie. Have no action, thrill just bore and darama film. Not up to the mark "
4532," Overhyped
"," I almost only saw de best ratings but in reality this movie is just overhyped, very sad and just boring "
4533," Beware...
"," Overhyped... Those ratings are somewhat pumped, they will burst like an old man's balloons. Not the worst movie, but nowhere close to put it in top 250 movies all time. Ratings are so rigged. "
4534," Quite boring to be honest.
", I found the movie quite boring. It did drag on for a long time without a lot happening. 
4535," Lame
"," Just One word for the movie ""LAME""
I mean jaquin is awesome i mean awesome but the storyline sucks at every point.... "
4536," Definitely not a 10
", This was a good movie but definitely not a 10. I could laugh through the whole movie and not have many lines and look good too. Definitely not Oscar worthy for any actor but great movie plot. Wait for Netflix 
4537," Slow, predictable, terrible
"," So boring, stupid, awful. I can't say enough how unnecessary this movie is. There are some fine artistic qualities but all of those can be seen simply by watching the trailer, and more than 2 minutes of this movie is too much. "
4538," its a snooze
"," Im sorry if u think u going to see joker in this movie..... nope
you are meeting arthur for most of the movie. this killed the joker origin
this movie is not close to joker, u see him as the joker clown for 5 minutes
please save your money "
4539," Not movie that needed to be made
"," This is a movie about a mentally unwell and depressed loner who lives in a dark fantasy world. He goes on a murder rampage, but is ultimately lauded by the masses as a hero. The fact that so many people rate this 9/10 speaks volumes about just how numb our society has become to real world events that seem to happen every week in America. I had to walk out in protest before the very end. Why do we need movies like this from Hollywood? "
4540," I can't be the only one...
"," The acting was great, no doubt. Phoenix will probably win an award. The story was ok, but the movie was sooo boring! I can't be the only person that thinks this. I can only assume all these 10 reviews are from millennials who have only got to see mediocre movies in the past 15 years. "
4541," Boring
"," Boring drama movie with some action and gore actually. Even though the acting was very good, but for what, when it is depicting very evil behavior? I'm against that and could not enjoy that so I wish I watched another movie instead. "

What is it bad guy insane guy plot (very weak) "
4547," Hot garbage
"," From start to finish it's just trash. Anyone saying that Joaquins acting was so amazing was watching a different movie than I saw. He was absolutely basic, he couldn't even come close to pulling off the iconic Joker laugh....it sounded like he was crying, actually pretending to (poorly) to cry from the start and it never got any better.<br/><br/>He looks terrible, he spends most of his scenes sucking in his stomach for a reason that is never explained and there is nothing that sells this sloppy ass mess as the Joker's proper origin story.<br/><br/>Get off the bandwagon people, this movie sucks ass. "
4548," Your Joking right
", This movie sucked until the last 15 min. When he turned into the Joker Rambo had more action then this chick flick!!! The Joker is supposed to be a evil villien who fell into a batch of chemicals Original story line that's where got the laugh &amp; the smile and it was a nice fix at the end when a joker hench men shot and killed Bruce's parents. 
4549," Joaquin Phoenix I'm sorry it wasn't your fault.
"," So DC has created a new company that will make their new standalone movies , so they did everything they can to connect all the dots they could if you are a DC fan you'll see what the dots are. Props to the cinematography that glues you because the story will just whoop your ass into circles. "
4550," Heavily hyped!!!
"," The best thing in this movie is the actor, he plays an amazing role...but the movie itself is nothing special, it is waaaay too hyped, it even had 9.4 rating before the movie was released. I am giving it 1 only because I think the movie is no more than 6.5 and to have some balance because 10 is just exaggerated...and again how can you not watch the movie and give it a 10, that's just a lie...disappointing movie. "
4551," Not great
"," Incredibly boring. Was very disappointed. However, the acting was incredible. "

", Whilst Joaquin Phoenix shines as the Joker this movie was an extremely blasphemous telling of his story. Rating the movie as a tragic tale of a tortured soul driven to the breaking point I'd rate it 7 out of 10. But as the origin story of the Joker I'd rate as being on the waiting list to get to 0. So many things that just are blasphemous to the Batman universe and to the history of the Joker. I can't.

4559," Its not Great. Buts its surely different.
"," JOKER - For me i don't think there will any actor to top what 'Heath Ledger' did with the character of Joker (with a sufficient amount of credit to the Director Christopher Nolan) in THE DARK KNIGHT. That movie is not just my favorite Comic book movie , but my Favorite movie of all time PERIOD. And a major credit for that to happen goes to the portrayal of JOKER in it. Joaquin Phoenix was awesome in this movie. But for me, Joker is a fascinating character to be used in an intelligent way to elevate the material. When a whole movie is made based on him with him being in each and every scene of the film, somehow the character becomes less fascinating to me. But that's just me. It can be different for everyone.<br/><br/>Now i didn't loved this movie, as much as i wanted to. I liked it. but somehow it was not completely for me. the movie has been unanimously praised by the Audience (9.1/10 IMDb right now) and YouTube Reviewers. And has been declared below average by the 'Writing Critics' (58% on metacritics). I fall somewhere in between them. For me the movie creates a fascinating world which makes me more interested to what may come next than actually liking what this movie by itself was. Joaquin Phoenix famously turned down the role of Dr. Strange before it went to Benedict Cumberbatch just because Phoenix didn't wanted to be a part of FRANCHISE GAME. But this movie has been made in such a way (so many Batman References) that it screams for a sequel. Which brings me to the point that WARNER BROS has put themselves in a very difficult situation here. The fans are gonna want a sequel to this film , hell even i want a sequel and i didn't even loved it outright. Now this movie was set in 1981, when Bruce Wayne was just a child, which means for him being an inexperienced BATMAN the sequel will have to take place in late 90s , which of course can not be then connected to JUSTICE LEAGUE. We don't have any idea in which time the upcoming Batman Solo movie by Matt Reeves will be based on. But if you ask me, i would say if there will be only one BATMAN in DCEU then i would want him to be in JOKER UNIVERSE than JUSTICE LEAGUE UNIVERSE. Because BATMAN has always been a better hero when he works solo. I know its a long shot, but i sincerely want Matt Reeve's BATMAN to be set in 90s being a sequel to JOKER even if JOKER not being in that film and then we will get the showdown in the THIRD-INSTALLMENT. Yeah i know i am just daydreaming.<br/><br/>Now what good things i got from this movie ?
1. Some exceptional acting. Yes even if i think Joaquin Phoenix was not as great as Heath Ledger, he 100% deserves an Oscar Nomination. I wouldn't be sad if he wins either. Robert De Nero was actually great too in his very small but very effective extended cameo.
2.Beautiful Cinematography - Somehow my IMAX Screen filled totally which only happens when someone actually shot the movie with an IMAX camera. but apparently Lawrence Sher the cinematographer has shot the movie in a 1.85:1 ratio, which worked great. This movie didn't needed to look good, but i love when the filmmaker goes out of their way to make their movies gorgeous.
3. The background score (by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir) although very loud, works great with the unsettling feels of the film.
4. Every-time the movie stops being a character study and try to contribute more to the BATMAN MYTHOLOGY, it brought smile to my face.<br/><br/>This movie can be said as the most Distant Comic-Book movie ever made from being an actual Comic-Book movie. Except those contributions to the Batman Mythology there was nothing Comic-Bookish about this film. There was not a single action scene in the film. not a single scene which pumps your heart with taking you to the edge of the seat , getting excited about what is gonna happens next. Not enough comedy either, which is pretty shocking considering the fact that its being directed by the director of HANGOVER TRILOGY. And there is nothing wrong with making a good character study, where we only watch the things happening in one person's life. But it was not for me. At-least not 100%. I mean you can only watch so many times other people behaving badly with the lead character again and again and again until the temperature rises above the upper limit and the lead character fights back which by the way happened at the very last 25-30 mins of the movie, and even at that time the pace of the movie never rises. Then there were those artistic scenes where the character just dances with himself, talks to himself, laughs with himself siting alone in a room, without the story actually getting forward in those moments. Its too much artistic for its own good. Too much of a slow burn for me.<br/><br/>What i want is that now the ground work is done. And this movie is going to be a massive hit. And i want the same team of Director, Writer, Cinematographer and Composer to make a sequel based in this same universe but which will be more exciting, which doesn't feel like its not a Comic book movie. I mean Nolan did it best. His Dark Knight Trilogy was very serious, but never gave the feeling that you are not watching a Comic Book movie.<br/><br/>Also if you are determined to catch this film on big screen , then try to watch it in IMAX. Its Marvelous to look at.<br/><br/>7.3/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR "

4561," An Honest Review
",
4562," This Joker isn't Violently Crazy and Shrewd, he's just Violently Crazy. viol
"," Don't let all the hype fool you, Joker is not a great movie. It has some good cinema photography and great music. But it's a diiferent Joker than the one Heath Ledger played. Where Ledger's Joker was crazy and shrewd, this Joker is just plain crazy. If you go in thinking that this will fit nicely into the Dark Knight trilogy, you will be sorely disappointed. If you wipe the slate clean and let it be a stand alone, it works better. I gave it a 7 as a stand alone. "
4563," MASTERPIECE
"," It,s a origin of joker and his pschycological worse jaoquin phoenix lives as joker his performance was tremendous writing was so good making of Todd Philips was extraordinary DOP looks cool a Robert deniro has some good portion a fantastic film based on DC,s character "
4564," Terrible
"," Pathetic, gross, depraved, shallow plot, indulgent, too much with the orchestra music (it's like violins all half the movie). The set and backdrop and costumes are great, but washing elderly mom in the bath, why? Why does Joker have such a pathetic origin story? Batman films are supposed to be no brainers, now I will not trust DC blindly - my bad I guess. Buyer beware. "
4565," A very important film
"," Gives an incredible view from the mind of someone suffering from mental illness and really puts the actions of those who suffer currently into perspective. I absolutely think this film is more than the basic social statement people may make it out to be, but it's also a powerful narrative that aligns with our times in a disturbing and sobering way. Joaquin Phoenix is a master and this film is one of the most impactful pieces of art I've seen in a long time. "

"," Sheds a light on how powerful and ""taboo"" this subject still is and looked down upon. Namaste Phoenix. BRILLIANT. "
4570," Astonishing performance by Phoenix. Last 20 minutes will blow your mind away.
"," It's a very slow paced character study showing the death of Arthur Fleck and the birth of Joker. Joaquin Phoenix has given the best performance of the year and it will be a travesty if he doesn't win the Oscar. As a mentally ill person he is brilliant and when he becomes the Joker he takes his game to the next level. The last 20 minutes of the film are absolutely sensational and you wish it never ended. Lastly, I must mention the score of this movie. Its absolutely amazing and fits the movie perfectly. Ignore the bad critics reviews and watch the movie. You wont be disappointed. "

"," A slow boil ballet to violence! Joaquin Phoenix turns in one of the most brilliant acting performance ever filmed. He turns his body into a machine, his face into a mask his voice into a choir. An amazing tour de force of acting! Hardly a misstep in the entire 2hours &amp; 2mins. Be prepared to be mesmerized by his performance. The entire movie is just a pure gem! "
4573," Made an account just to give it a review and 10/10
"," One of the best movies ever made imo. Everything about this movie is 10/10. The actors, cinematography, setting, the score etc. But these are not the only few reasons why it's amazing. Although it is really dark and can be upsetting, there a few scenes I could cry too on just how beautiful so many scenes are. This is an amazing story about how pretty well anyone who has a mental illness, gets bullied, has dealt with trauma, has depression or anything along those lines could be pushed so far where they seriously lose their mind and lose all hope. I find this movie could really hit home for some people including myself. Bottom line is this movie is unlike any other, just because it is disturbing and upsetting does not mean you shouldn't watch it. Theres a lot of important messages from this movie that can really make you think and that can easily apply to real life. You also don't have to be a superhero fan at all to enjoy this movie. Absolute masterpiece. "
4574," A Decent Joker Take, But Not The One I Prefer
"," After seeing the credits roll on ""Joker"", it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit ""off"" about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while ""Joker"" is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.<br/><br/>For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.<br/><br/>I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this ""take"" on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying ""here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up"", right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything ""wrong"" with this take.<br/><br/>That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of ""The Dark Knight"" or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of ""Batman (1989)"". Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.<br/><br/>There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:
-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.
-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the ""easy way out"" when it comes to crafting this story.<br/><br/>Fortunately, ""Joker"" does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one. "

4583," Many reasons why Joker is so successful as a Villian.
"," As we all know this movie is character study of Joker but for me it tells us the many reasons why Joker was so successful as a bad guy. Right throughout the movie it felt like a prequel to famous batman trilogy or more to just Dark Knight. Arthur Fleck (Joker) going through different types of hell in the movie explains so much that how he got so close to defeating batman. He got everything around batman except the batman. And I think why batman was above Joker is also told in the movie. This movie is poetic to me and a perfect prequel to Dark Knight.
The acting in this movie is something else. Joaquin Phoenix with his odd body shapes and his seemless changes of expressions has given one of the greatest performance ever. De Niro as always is wonderful to watch even for 10-15 minutes of his role. Nobody else had much screen time but they were all good.
Anybody reading this review to decide whether to go watch the movie or not than I say you should go coz these kinds of movie don't come often. "

4609," Forget the story look at my acting
"," This was obviously an attempt by JP to win an Oscar and every scene reinforces this.

There are some scenes that serve no purpose except to showcase another aspect of JP's repertoire. Cityscape and dialogue/framing stolen shamelessly from Se7en.

4615," Why so serious tho
"," My biggest complaint about the Joker Movie is it's really hard to just sit and enjoy a movie that spends sooo muuuchh timmeee going ""Look at me aren't I just so deep, look at this scene this scene is so good, I am such an Oscar-worthy movie don't you think, look how amazing I am""<br/><br/>And the message that goes with it is just... not as revolutionary as the movie itself thinks it is.<br/><br/>It's fine. It's not terrible. I enjoyed it and am glad I went to see it. Still better than Jared Leto's Joker, low bar that that is. But it's not this grand, intense and deeply artistic examination of the human condition. It really, really thinks it is, but it's not. "
4616," Overly violent
"," This was an interesting movie which lived through the lens of the villain. The Joker is clearly traumatised from childhood abuse and bullying throughout his life, but him killing nearly everyone who 'wronged' him was off putting to watch. Despite that, Joaquin did an amazing performance and he was very compelling but the constant violence was not my forte. "
4617," lost hope
"," Time wasted film.................
. totally no magic of acting...health ledger isvall time best "
4618," Not a DC movie not a good movie üòê
"," Ok let's make this very clear this has virtually nothing to do with DC.
This film I suspect was going to get made and going to be called Joker regardless of the DC Monika being attached or not, as it is a basically a hash up of king of comedy taxi driver deer hunter etc etc, DC probably thought they may as well endorse it and make a few bucks.Which it will and soo many people are going to boat how great it is because they have been told it is amazing and won't want to look stupid.<br/><br/>As a DC movie it makes absolutely no Sense as a standalone homage to Scorsese nope still makes no sense. "
4619," Incredible performances, plot missing
", Make no mistake. Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy. But plot is not deep enough to justify his actions. Pacing was slow. Not enough screen presence given to other actors. Too much of Phoenix. Although nice build up to the Joker character. 
4620," Arthur Fleck, King of the Rats
"," The director tries his hand at a more serious movie than we're used to seeing him make and admittedly that was my main deterrent in believing this film would be anything more than what it actually could be. We can compare and say it's inspired by better films like Taxi Driver all day long but it doesn't change the fact that the movie has the huge safety net of being about one of the most popular fictional characters in modern times otherwise no one would care about a movie about Arthur Fleck. You could argue that that was the directors' intention all along, shining a light on societies' apathy towards mental health but perhaps it would be reading too much into it. Todd Phillips attempts a character study and made the right call in casting a great actor to deliver a great performance. This movie tells the story of what would happen to someone who doesn't understand why the world is such a rude, awful, savage place that you can't even make people smile without getting a beating but, instead of letting people get away with their behavior, he finds you can carry out your own form of justice. Overall it was a fun 2 hours but I couldn't help but feel the need to leave the theater as quickly as possible for whatever reason. 3* "

4623," Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahaha hahahaha hahahaha
"," The character was played flawlessly, no words to describe it, it felt like Joaquin Phoenix is the new machinist Christian bale, just by looking at the kinda body he has made for this movie. Being the backstory of the supervillain, I expected some personal attack but this was merely based upon the jobless scenario that happened over the country a few decades back, which means there should be several other super villains as well.
About Acting: Sometimes while watching the movie, it felt that Kamal Hassan from Tamil cinema has done so much variety of actings that cannot even be recreated by these Hollywood folks. Hmmm. "

4626," Is this a Joke?
"," Okay. I have never been more excited for a movie in my entire 24 years of life. I would cry watching the trailer, hyperventilate whenever the date got closer; even almost got a Joker tattoo on opening day. But wow. I'm pretty disappointed, and completely shocked at how everyone's just passing out 10's for this. First off, it's not bad. But it's not a ""masterpiece."" PROS: The acting. It's good... but not great. And I hate to say that because Phoenix is one of my most favorite actors of all time. It just seemed overacted at times. The cinematography. Wow. The most breathtaking film I have ever seen. I was floored by how gorgeous each and every shot was. Worth seeing it for that aspect alone. CONS: Writing. The story just wasn't there. It was quite boring. Some of it was just silly in my opinion. Like him dancing every second and laughing/choking... it got old fast. Some of the dialogue was quite cringy, trying to be edgy. Seemed pretty aimless overall with no real plot. Wasn't entertaining. I kept looking at the time to see when it was over. Also, when he dances down the steps? Terrible song choice. And the twist with him imagining the girl with him the whole time? Seemed like they wanted some shock value, but it wasn't very impactful. I just didn't care. Also, isn't the Joker supposed to be an incredibly intelligent mastermind? Arthur came off to me as slow, somewhat dumb, and a little annoying at times. Almost like a dumb little child. Overall, this film seemed to take itself more seriously than it ended up being. It was overly pretentious, tried way too hard to live up to the classics. I feel like this project was too heavy for such an inexperienced director like Phillips to carry. I mean, he's used to doing frat boy comedies, what do you expect? Had this been in the hands of Scorsese, Aronofsky, or any of the greats, this would've been amazing. It just kinda bombed for me. Guess the joke's on me. "

4628," I fell asleep ........
"," Mid way through the movie I dozed off. The movie is slow, not put together well and the story is below avg. Very little action and suspense. The shock affect for me was not there. "
4629," Solid
"," The acting was great, but other than that it felt a bit derivative. It channeled a little too much Taxi Driver and lost some originality because of it. There are a lot of people super passionate about this movie, but the rating will drop soon. Definitely worth a watch. Also for those wondering... Ledger is still king "
4630," Crap film
", Film very slow and boring should not have been made 
4631," Boooo
"," Nah jokes, I loved the movie. I just wanted to be the only person to give it a 1 star even though its 10 out of 10. "
4632," Meh... Had potential but could have been better.
"," I wanted to love the movie but I just didn't. As someone who attended the premiere, I went in with a mindset to love it but it didn't work. Where was Ben Affleck's Batman when Joker was causing all these chaos? Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman too! Henry Cavill's beautiful Superman with a mustache as well? And Aquabro, Cyboeg and Shazam? Where were they all?! I thought this was supposed to be part of Zaddy Snyder's DC Universe. This was supposed to be connected to Snyder's masterpiece Justice League. Jared Leto's Joker was supposed to be Arthur Fleck's authustic son. There was none of it in it. This is just Taxi Driver but with Joker. Remove Joker from it and the movie still would've worked okay. Disappointed because I was expecting a lot of DC characters to appear especially Henry Cavill's Superman with his mustache :( "
4633," Joker maniacally descends into madness but really the joke is on us for watching it.

4634," Boring,depressing
"," This movie is perfect for cringy edgemasters. Also a perfect oscar-bait movie which is boring,depressing and trying to hide that it has a very meaningful plot by keeping the tone dark,violent "
4635," Movie sucked!
", No one can replace the Joker role played by Heath Ledger. Phoenix is not creepy nor terrifying as Ledger.

", The story is beautiful. It showes that no one is born to be cruel but he was made evil by the society.. however the movie itself was like 2 hours and it didnt need that much time to show the story..<br/><br/>The acting was good tho but i understand how people dont like this movie because its not a typical joker thing. 
4639," Is it a Joker ?!

4640," Good job, Phoenix
"," A good performance from Joaquin, but in general the film does not bring anything new. "
4641," Worth watch it but is not spectacular
", Best you will watch is Joaquin Phoenix 10/10. Art and photography 10/10. Script 6/10. 
4642," Good overall, but nothing new
"," Surely whe can't deny the fact that the movie is well made and Joaquin's acting is magnificent. When it comes to the directing and the moods, neon lights and new york-y vibes is seen before. Arthur's way to craziness is surely well built, but we have seen people being led to crazy, illegal behavior in movies before such as the Machinist. This joker had more self pitty and the classic being bullied kind of theme we've seen over and over again the latest years had me dissatisfied. When it comes to the lower class, anarchic youth revolution and ode to bringing down the elite, it reminded me of mr Robot, people in the streets with the masks, vandalizing and being violent. This movie is just a ""safe"" movie to make, if you just have a great lead actor, it is a replica/reproduction of ideas and phenomena repeatedly used. It did not meet my expectations. "
4643," Love Joaquin Phoenix
"," Joaquin Phoenix is what makes this movie worth watching - the storyline is long and a bit borring if you ask me, but Joaquin Phoenix performance in this movie is incredible, if it had been any other actor this movie would have been gone directly to some online streaming service. I still think is it a movie worth watching, but if you think you are going to something revolutionering then you will be disappointed. "
4644," Uphill task. Did it magnificently.
"," I am a huge huge fan of Christopher Nolan. I found his story telling of Joker masterful and the whole weave of the Dark knight was on point. It was alway going to be a tough task for a new Joker movie to even come close, without the big budget, huge star cast and amazing plucked strings by Han Zimmer. However I felt this Joker still managed to atleast level it with different tactics. It used more relevant, realistic and current issues in the world and wove it in to a beautifully written story with enough plot twists to keep DC knowers on the edge. Very clever in its delivery. People say it's predictable. Off course it is. It's an origin story. You know the end result. But the delivery of a new version of the story was impeccable. You can not upscale dark knight with louder music, bigger bangs and bigger cameras than IMAX. This is what Michael Bay tries to do every time. It ends in poorly executed films. This was graceful in its methods.<br/><br/>Bravo. "
4645," Don't Fall off your seat
"," I haven't enjoyed a J.P movie this much since Walk the Line and in all honesty I don't even known if he has been in one since. But for a man with his caliber (as a lefty) to take upon a role that has had some amazing names marked against it and make it as Gooooood as he did was remarkable.
He made you fall in love with the charator, feel his quirky indie danve vibe, feel sorry for him having his 'condition' and then again feel rejoiced for it. Being a little slow at one stage had me look at the time and see I still had 40 minutes to go... but the release was well worth it.
I'm super excited to see how they portray him in possible future roles, because he currently has Gotham in his hands. "
4646," It's an okay transformative-remake
"," So, if you have seen Taxi Driver (1976) and King of Comedy (1982), then you've seen this movie already. They did a good job at creating a love letter to those films, while slapping the stamp of DC's Batman to attract even more people.!<br/><br/>Sadly, it is one of those movies that you can watch once, it won't change your life, and then you can/will forget about it forever. Specially since the plot is really straight forward and a tad predictable (if you are not a teenager or not familiar with movies).. but the inclusion of a small twist keeps you engaged, even if it isn't that interesting or impactful, as it helps the movie reach the finish line in one piece.
There are no memorable moments, or action scenes, no set pieces that are worth remembering or re-watching, or even good lines for people to keep with them for years to come.. but it has good direction and cinematography. Joaquin does a good generic crazy guy that is quite believable. The rest of the cast is mostly forgettable in comparison.<br/><br/>But the more I think about it, the more I forget it.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>As a DC-universe movie, it was kind of bad..
Since it may be important for some die-hard fans, this isn't a real Batman's Joker movie. There is no criminal mastermind, no great plan.. just a coincidence by a guy with issues in a city gone to hell, mostly caused by the idiocy and poor choice of words of a rich guy. If they are smart enough, they'll let it end here, instead of reviving a Joker character (that is as interesting as Leto's) to fight Batman in a one-sided match that would not be interesting.. unless they rewrote Joaquin's character from the ground-up. "
4647," An Honest Review
"," Phoenix was fantastic and probably does deserve the Oscar for the performance, but it's not enough to give this a 10.<br/><br/>I think the writers got lost in the story of mental illness and making a political statement on social hierarchys and how life isnt fair, 'that's life' unfortunately. They do it fanatasically it has to be said. You sympathise with Arthur throughout. Everyone he kills kind of deserves it you feel.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to his killings though it's more reactive and impulsive. Which is why Pheonix's Joker lacks the fundamentals of the original villain. That he's supposed to be a calculated psychopathic anarchist. He lacks the premeditation and intelligence of Ledger's Joker and this is why I dont think he can feature in the Batman films. Plus by the time Bruce grows up to be Batman, Joker will be an OAP!<br/><br/>""Some people just want to watch the world burn"", but I don't think Arthur does. He's a man out of touch with reality, he doesn't know if he exists or not. He cared for his Mother and tried to make people laugh until the government cut funding his therapy and meds. It's the sad story of a deeply unfortunate life.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great film and again JP was outstanding, I just feel the writers lost sight that Joker is supposed to be a villain. One that will argubaly prove to be Batman's toughest adversary. "
4648," great movie
", It is a very good movie. The only reason i give it a 9 is because I think Heath Ledger was a more believable psycho. But it is an Oscar movie 
4649," Average
"," The studio has done a marvelous job marketing this movie as only they know how but it doesn't do anything for the content which is really quite average. The script is very derivative and boring, hardly a funny joke in it which despite the dark tone would have done wonders for the movie. Performances are good but this movie is all hype. In the end we see Fleck flipping over into the dark side and become a mindless killer, but the irony is that the numerous depictions of the Joker in cartoons have more depth in the character than in this movie. Another average film made into a box office success by studio marketing wizardry. "
4650," A Gritty Origin Story With As Many Flaws As Arthur Fleck
",
4651," Really Really Good, Not Quite Perfect
"," I tried not to have high expectations for this movie, but the trailers made it seem so good. Luckily, it more or less delivered. It was pretty refreshing to see an origin story for a villain rather than a superhero, the story was pretty gripping, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a great take on the Joker that is relatively unique.<br/><br/>There were still cons, though. About halfway through, there was a lull in the story after Arthur killed the men on the subway. It was poised as him finally snapping after so much crap being thrown at him from the world, but it was like he snapped, then found some more motivations in his mother not telling him he was adopted, then snapping again and then becoming the Joker we expect. Though I like the idea of Arthur holding himself back because of societal norms, and abandoning that obstacle by killing the men on the subway, but still holding himself together for more personal reasons like his mom or therapy, only to lose those too, I think these motivations could have been paced more smoothly. Some scenes were a bit too long and sort of hit you over the head with the point, which made the film feel slow sometimes.
I know it's an origin movie and motives are important, and I'm glad they spent time to actually build them up, but it seemed to just keeping building and building, almost past the point of sympathy and believability. It was interesting how they made the love story all in his head because I thought it was way underdeveloped until they made that reveal, but it kind of only tells the audience that he's lonely and crazy, which we already know. So that's a bit of a dead end. Personally, I kind of wanted to see more of the big bad Joker that we're familiar with, but again, I know it's an origin story, and this version of the character is a bit more reserved so it does make sense.<br/><br/>Now for the pros. I'm very glad they didn't have the ""love interest"" be like, the only crutch for his sanity and only when he lost her could he be the Joker. Similarly, I like that they have a ton of different kinds of motives and reasons for Arthur to become the Joker instead of just one thing or event being the cause. And I liked that they gave Arthur reasoning behind the things he was doing, but they made it clear that he went off the rails in terms of retribution. I slightly worry, however, about some misguided people taking his joke towards the end (the whole ""What do you get when you cross a cruel society etc. etc.""), while great as a piece of dialogue, as a reason to think they can also lash out? Or see themselves as the Joker and follow in his footsteps? I'm not sure, but it's a fine line to walk.<br/><br/>Anyway, there were also some great moments of set up and pay off, which isn't as common in blockbuster or superhero type movies nowadays, but it comes across as more sophisticated and thorough. One plot thread that they did very well, and set up very well, was the connection to the Wayne family. It started subtly with the letters his mother writes to Wayne, and gradually builds up in a natural way. I'm glad they didn't have Joker kill Bruce's parents, but I'm glad that the whole chaotic uprising that the Joker directly caused, caused Bruce's parents to be killed. You can't really have a Joker movie without mentioning Batman, but I think they had the right amount where it made an impact on the story while also setting up the Batman origin, without distracting from the Joker. Similarly, I like that they have Gotham at a boiling point so it made sense that his ""statement"" on the subway would spark a descent into chaos. They did a good job humanizing Arthur to an extent where you can sympathize for him, he wants to makes kids smile, he's pretty down on his luck in the world, but they still make the audience know that his methods are what makes him a villain. Ang again, I like that they had several different motives, internal and external, for him to become the Joker. His mother not telling him he's adopted, the world continuing to beat him up, literally getting beat up, even losing his therapy and medication. All the pillars of his life fell like dominos, and it made sense.<br/><br/>Overall, I really did enjoy the movie. I thought it was well done, it had the overall tragic, uneasy, yet twistedly comical vibe that you would expect with the Joker. There was a fair amount of imagery that seems fine at first glance but the longer the camera holds on it, the more uneasy you feel. It wasn't perfect, but it was very good. "
4652," What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?
",
4653," A joy for your eyes but the story doesn't work so well
"," Great acting and wonderful picture overall, but honestly the story never takes off.
Last scene totally pointless, could be an 8 without last 5 mins. "
4654," Halfway there
"," If you are coming here expecting to see prequel to the joker immortalised by Heath ledger this movie is half way there. This movie is not remotely as entertaining as Dark knight, instead it's a character study of joker.<br/><br/>This movie tries to answer why joker is the way he is. And it accomplishes it to a certain extent. What it doesn't manage to do that well is for the audience to empathize with the protagonist. Joker in the dark knight is possibly the most likeable super villain, the way he managed to captivate the audience. This movie doesn't do a great job of that. After watching you would be left wondering whether you should be on the side of the joker.<br/><br/>Instead this movie has a taxi driver feel to it. "
4655," Absolutely Amazing!
"," This was definitely worth the hype. Phoenix surely deserves an Oscar for this performance. Joker is a difficult character to portray on the screen since he has so many layers. Yet the movie did complete justice to him. The character development in the movie is amazing and didn't feel rushed/illogical at any point.
The background music, throughout the movie, gives you goosebumps and keeps you hooked. This is a must watch. "
4656," Good but too much exposition.
", A very dark and serious movie but when it gets more interesting it ends. 
4657," 10/10
"," One of the best movie ever. what an act , oscar worthy movie. "
4658," The best Joker till date !
"," Joker is undoubtedly overwhelming, mind blowing , dazzling, breathtaking one !<br/><br/>The movie slowly starts with Arthur's day to day life and completely turns into a chaotic athmosphere towards the end. I am sure of one thing this movie will be marked up as the best of Joaquin and the best Joker ever. I truly wanted to see a performance which overcomes Heath Ledger's Joker and Joaquin just made the wish come true. Joaquin Phoenix you beauty!<br/><br/>Truly a masterpiece!
Climax portions = Adrenaline Rush<br/><br/>'There's no punchline' :) "
4659," Best cinematic experience in this decade
"," After what Heath Ledger did in the Dark Knight no one even came close to it but, Joaquin Phoenix lived up to our expectations and I must say don't miss your chance to see this one in the theater if you missed the Dark Knight. "
4660," Better than expected
"," I went in having high hopes only to get them all met and more. JP does an extraordinary take on the joker, breathtaking, familiar yet new. Definitely my film of the year. "
4661," A Masterpiece !! No movie can come even close to this much greatness !
",
4662," Worth the hype and expectations!
"," Joaquin Phoenix, what a performance, he really made us liking him. Felicitous for the Joker role! He lived as Joker, very empathetic one. Critics just like to whine about the movie that it's bad just to get attention for their sake. You know what? This movie is and will be one of the phenomenal movies of 2019. The message the movie tried to convey via cinematography at climax is an art, pure excellent art! The movie is so raw that it's actually disturbing to watch some scenes(Violence/Gore). This is how a dark movie should be made. One of the best movies to portray what a man/woman can go upto based on how society treats him/her. Just ignore the critics and watch the movie! "
4663," Ledger was a sane man acting crazy, Phoenix is properly insane...
",
4664," It's gonna be movie of the year
"," I'm very sure heath ledger will smile if he sees the next generation of jokers. This will be the best thriller of the year, but will Joaquin win the best actor of the year in the Oscar event? Can't wait! "
4665," A rip off of everything, even other DC movies.
"," You've seen a lot of comparisons to taxi Driver, King of Comedy etc and rightfully so, it's pretty much the same script mashed up with some previous DC movies and Death Wish thrown in. Todd Phillips even throws in the finger gun to the head from Taxi Driver and the fake TV set from KOC, heck let's just get DeNiro too!. If you tell us it's an homage then just repeat everything it's just a completely unoriginal movie in every way. This is not the Joker, it's a made up origin story that makes the Joker a pretty dull character with both mommy and daddy issues.<br/><br/>Answer me this, why is the Joker a 44 year old guy and young Bruce Wayne only 9? So when they fight as adults Bruce is 35 and the Joker is a 70 year old man?<br/><br/>Having Bruce Wayne's parents be killed by a clown is just stupid.<br/><br/>Please don't make a sequel. "
4666," Disappointing
", Had potential to be great but was underwhelmed. Truly the most disappointing movie of 2019. Where were the Justice League when Joker was doing all these crazy things? I kept waiting for Ben Affleck's Batman to show up but he didn't. Zack Snyder should come back to the DC franchise. Period. 
4667," dont belive the Hype
",
4668," So overrated, Phoenix' creative choices totally unfounded and weird
"," Literally had to make an account once I saw all the 10-star reviews. The movie was ok at best, and everyone needs to relax. There is so much that goes undeveloped and underdeveloped in this movie. And Phoenix' choice to play the Joker as ultra feminine and then all of a sudden bring out a southern belle accent in the final scene simply doesn't make sense. Director just put in a lot of random scenes, maybe thinking that random equates to crazy. It doesn't, and it hurt the movie. All the hype is simply people jumping on the bandwagon. It wasn't that good. "
4669," Nothing special
"," What do you people see here!? Movie promotes violance for solving problems. This is a story of a guy with a mental illness cause of his troubled past. Yes, mentaly ill people shouldn't carry a gun, that's all I can take from this movie. The fact that it is so highly rated scares me that there realy are so many supporters of somone like Joker out there, like in the movie. The last time that happened we had a WW2 on our hands. I addimt Joaquin played the role convincingly. Heath is still my favourite Joker though and with a far better storyline. "
4670," Only reason I gave it a 7 was Joaquin Phoenix.
"," Great acting, below average story and you get a 7 out of 10. Those giving this a 10 out of 10 need to their head a shake. Without Joakin Phoenix this movie would be a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best. The story is pretty dull. "
4671," Powerful but Plagiarized
"," This movie certainly has its strengths. Terrific performances by Phoenix and De Niro (who stands out even given his minor role), command the screen; interesting commentary on the importance of resources for the mentally ill; shocking scenes that hit hard even in today's media desensitization to violence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>My issue with the movie come from its relative lack of story originality. It was as if writers Todd Phillips and Scott Silver recreated Taxi Driver, but replaced the subplot of prostitution ring with the King of Comedy talk show themes (and Rupert Pupkin associated discomfort). Not to mention the last scene with Arthur walking out of the room with blood covering his shoes seems to be taken directly from No Country to Old Men, and the group of Wall Street guys taunting Arthur on the subway bears striking resemblance to the gangs in A Clockwork Orange. This movie aligns so close to Taxi Driver that plagiarism must be called into question. Between character parallels (Bickle and Joker; Charles Palantine and Thomas Wayne); turning point scenes (when Bickle snaps in the convenience store = when Bickle snaps in the subway); regular scenes (the finger gun to the head); and questions after the fact such as what is real vs. imaginary.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It is okay for a movie to be inspired by another work, but this seems to be taking that ""inspiration"" a few steps too far. "
4672," Good, but not great.
"," 'Joker' was neither a disappointment nor a triumph. Good, but not great. If you have seen films such as 'Taxi Driver' or 'The King of Comedy,' you won't find any surprises here in terms of story, unfortunately. However, Joaquin Phoenix's great performance, as per usual, and the surprisingly striking visual style of the movie make it just unique and entertaining enough to be worth a watch. "
4673," JUST WOW, WOW, WOW, WOW
", For it to be a original story of the JOKER was just amazing. If you're expecting what you want out from the JOKER? I promise you will get it all from this masterpiece.

4680," Dark Masterpiece
"," Spoiler alert, don't read if you plan watching the movie ""Joker""
The ""Joker"" always intrigued me because it seemed to me that the creative freedom to give life and character to joker was more important than creating a batman 2.0, 3.0 and so forth as versions of the movie came along.
Think about it, a dark character- called Joker! And another thought to ponder - similar to athletics records getting broken all the time which is in a way victory of the mind over muscle, there's the other logical application of mind in creativity and this particular character has evolved from a vanilla villain, to a psychopath and the most recent one... I don't even know how to describe him. He represents a lot of what the world is becoming, and draws sympathy from actions that are so wrong and very anti-social.
From Jack Nicolson with ""So much to do, so little time""... and the acting canvas that gave Heath Ledger (RIP) which I had assumed to be very tough to beat and along comes the masterpiece of Joaquin Rafael Phoenix.<br/><br/>It was tough to miss a movie that has the Joker playing lead and the watching experience was very unnerving. This was perhaps the darkest of all Joker-in-character movie with a very strong satirical take on our own society. So much so, that some countries saw demands of banning this movie.<br/><br/>I had read about Ledger distancing himself from the world, dealing with insomnia and at the same time build the Joker character. He was given a lot of freedom and the genius in this actor delivered a top-notch experience where in his own words ""It is a physically and mentally draining role - his Joker is a 'psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy""<br/><br/>Phoenix's portrayal of the same character was more challenging. It had to transform a person who was unlucky, some may say ""a loser"", and a person dealing with serious mental disorders thru really logical circumstances where the state fails to continue funding his medicines, his continuing bad luck and facing apathy and violence to someone who's such a dark psychopath that he easily redefines another state of ""the goodness of evil"".
Gone was the dark set of Gotham, any gross inequality or injustice in the society overall or the need for a vigilante. In some parts of the movie I heard a few laughs from the audience which sounded totally out of place to me. I didn't find one comic relief, maybe the character was too engrossing for me. Perhaps if Batman emerged in that train, to save Phoenix , I'd have clapped.
His first kill was a reaction to resist being bullied. And then it almost became the necessity of committing himself to be the quintessentially evil Joker...
The portrayal of a modern apathetic world had a ubiquitous influence over the evolving character. The darkness of the film was such that one doesn't feel guilty in empathy over the circumstances leading to evil than the evil itself.
After all, where's utopia anyway!<br/><br/>The movie - wow
The effort put in by Phoenix- OMG. The mental transformation led to the portrayal of the character and the physical transformation was beyond severe. Hope he wins an Oscar and also lives in peace. It amazes me how an artiste can get into a character so deep, and I hope it is as easy to extract oneself to reality once the character is played and over with. "
4681," Joaquin Phoenix!!!
"," I loved how excellent Joaquin it taking on Joker! It is a perfect match!<br/><br/>At first Joker was just wierd and acted ""cringe"" but as the movie went on he got my sympathy more and more!<br/><br/>Awesome end scenes!<br/><br/>(sry for spelling/grammatic errors) "
4682," Excellent film with magnificent acting
", This is well worth watching Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant. This is an Oscar worthy performance. It is a masterclass in how the west treat the mentally ill and the working class. 
4683," Best of 2019
"," Joker is the best film out there right now, Dark, Bold, Best DC film ever made. "
4684," Great , diffrent
", Not your regular superhero movie this movie is a masterpiece and all of the cinematography and the directing is amazing including the acting of Joaquin Phoenix which was the best of the best this movie is a masterpiece and everyone should see I dont have a single problem with this movie (GO AND WATCH IT.) 
4685," Simple but scary good
", It tip toes on some serious mental issues that some may even deal with daily but it still comes off entertaining gritty and funny when it needs to be definitely worth the watch 
4686," Freaking Legit!
"," At first I couldn't tell how I felt until I realized that what I was feeling was so many emotions all at once. This movie is compelling, gripping, memorizing, scary, eerie, gruesome, morbid, and overall just simply amazing. To be fair, my wife hated it. So it isn't a movie that everyone will enjoy. Some parts I'll admit, I had to look away. But the way Joaquin handles the role and develops the true nature of what it means to become the Joker is simply fantastic. He def deserves an Oscar for the performance he gave. I highly recommend this movie. "
4687," The critics don't know what they are talking about
"," The critics were obviously paid to write these reviews. Do not listen to them. This movie was so powerful and it had me in tears. Joker shows what society really is and how the impact of one's environment can actually mould them. It is raw with depth and portrays the real darkness people go through. Take the time to watch, you could learn something from it. "
4688," Clown world. Only the based know.
"," Clown world. Great movie.<br/><br/>Cast were all wonderful, I would certainly recommend. "
4689," A very unique and special interpretation of the Joker, but unfortunately the movie is very flawed.
",
4690," joker is a good movie but it's not as good as people say
"," Before this adaptation we've seen afew more Joker adaptations and I've seen Heath Ledger, jared leto and Mark hamill's voice demanding role so I won't consider Batman's(1989) joker.
Before I make comparison between joker adaptations let's turn back to the movie.
""if i'm going to have a past i prefer it to be multiple choice"" this line is from comics and this is somehow is verified in this movie. Joker has mental ilness and he is unreliable narrator so it is not certain whether the film is imagination of Artur or real. It's up to decide to audience and I liked that. Joaquin gave very good performance and his laugh is amazing in the movie. Also Robert de niro is good in a supporting role. Soundtrack of the movie is very good and It gives necessary tension. Although there are afew uncessary scenes the movie is not boring.
Aditionally, I have several issues with the Thomas wayne is depicted is a bad guy, doesn't matter whether he has a secret affair with joker's mother or not. And I didn't like seeing death of Batman's parents again and it is caused by Joker. And if this is just one movie that is not connected to DC cinematic universe why we see Bruce Wayne in it. finally, joaquin is impressive as a joker but not as good as Heath Ledger's joker so If you avoid this comparision you'll like the movie simply think two jokers are different jokers one is criminal mastermind and the other one is a sick man is tortured by society. "
4691," Everything I want in a movie
"," This movie has everything I want - good character development, a beautiful look and music that effortlessly propels the story along, genuine emotion that makes it shockingly relatable, and real meaning. Arthur Fleck's backstory gives Joker a sense of humanity that I like seeing in villain characters. He's not just some crazy psychopath, he's an actual person with thoughts and pains. He's real. And that's something that's carried over into the rest of the movie, as well. They made the movie feel like it's something that can actually happen. It's not overdone, it's not artificial, it's not pushed, it's just the story of some guy who felt distressed and unintentionally affected society. He had no out-of-this-world plan, that's actually just absurd if you think about it, to make a story. And the movie didn't have a plan to say anything about society. It's not political. It uses principles that are found in society to tell a good story, but it gives no call to action. And that realness, the raw storytelling, shows what it actually feels like to be someone like Arthur. It's truly artful. "
4692," Yea I'm giving it a 10/10, it's that good
"," Going into it, i didn't know why it was given and 8 minute standing ovation, after seeing it, i know understand. All i can say without spoiling it is-this will be a movie talked about for years to come. "
4693," Awesome
"," I thought this movie was super good. You can almost watch the actual moment when birth is given to the Joker. I loved the plot and the way it gave historical context to the man behind the villain. GREAT acting by Phoenix, great directing, great costumes, and great music. Everything blended really well. Can't wait for the next one. "
4694," Amazing Direction
"," Joker 2019 is a Masterpiece.
And Behind it there is always.

4695," Brilliant, haunting, best Joker!
", The hype is real with this movie. I went in thinking I hope I'm not going to be bored and another superhero movie. This is far from that and the movie was so mesmerising you couldn't look away for a second. Joaquin is an incredible actor and his performance in this was outstanding and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this I will be shocked and embarrassed of the film industry. Excellent and well worth seeing. 
4696," Painful
"," Not the real story!! Stop making these movies without the real background, they killed spiderman, now joker, and from the sound of things to come new batman. It's a shame. "
4697," Review
"," Brilliant movie!!
All cast are great actors, so sophisticated, psychology.
I will see again the movie :) "
4698," Amazing film
", It's a masterpiece. Loved it not overworked just real loved it. Well done.. 
4699," Outstanding performance by Joaquin
", This movie is so captivating and truly amazing but not as much as the performance by Joaquin. His acting is beyond words and explanations. A few actors can really put themselves in character but his skill to be this person is of the charts. He really deserve an oscar for this role. (sorry about my english) 
4700," Amazing.
", Probably the best movie I ever watched. Little scary tho. 
4701," Excellent Film
"," The overall reception of this film is pulled down by political reasons, not by the merit of the film, which, due to an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, an incredible score, game-changing color palette, and thought-provoking plot, deserves a chance by any viewer. Joker does not ask you to love it, and does not ask you to sympathize with the protagonist. Joker holds a mirror to the viewer, generating uncomfortableness to break the ice and start conversations. It is hard to stomach, but only because there is no sugar coating of the issues it brings into the light. Joker has sparked many a conversation between me and my friends about how we should always help those around us and how to deal with and help others through hard situations. "
4702," Masterpiece
", What can I say other than this is a masterpiece. The masterful acting of Joaquin Phoenix and the haunting soundtrack of Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir alone is worth the price of admission and it's a must watch movie in a theater. Watched it twice because it's a rare movie that relies on story and performances maybe since The Dark Knight to entertain the audience. 
4703," An absolute Masterpiece!
"," Absolutely amazing movie with an original story on one of the most iconic character ever. Joaquin Phoenix was just brilliant in portraying such a damaged character. He captivates you to every screen he is in.
This is the story of how the joker came to be. Many are comparing it to Heath Ledger's take on joker, but it was different. Heath's character was already completely transformed into the this crazy man who only wanted to bring chaos to the illusion of world order. But in this movie Arthur is not there yet. They are both on different stages of being the joker.
It was a compete deconstruction of a damaged human being who was rejected by the society which in turn created a dangerous ruthless man that the joker really is. "
4704," Masterpiece
", Story is very nice and very good acting by Joaquin Phoenix. This is masterpiece and deserve Oscar!! 
4705," No matter what anyone says, this film is a true masterpiece!
",
4706," Mental Illness Not Violence is the Central Theme of ""The Joker""
"," Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of The Joker is stellar. While many people are sidetracked by the violence (which is certainly reprehensible), there are many takeaways from the movie pertaining to mental illness.<br/><br/>It is very obvious from the onset that Arthur Fleck (The Joker's real name) leads a tortured life. Employed as a clown because his mother always told him he was put in the world to make people happy, he is bullied by kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>He tells his social worker that she never hears him which is symbolic of how he walks through the world; invisible, nonexistent, unheard, and unloved. A coworker hands him a gun to protect himself from bullying. It is not long before he uses it, not in a premeditated way, but to protect himself from being beaten up on the subway by three wealthy and arrogant businessmen.<br/><br/>As the search for the subway killer ensues with the sole clue being that he had a clown face, Arthur feels a twisted sense of accomplishment and admiration as a movement explodes in the city with people in clown costumes.<br/><br/>THE TAKEAWAYS:
(1) Mental illness has a stigma in our society. Arthur writes in his journal that ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.""<br/><br/>He is on seven medications and has a maniacal laugh. People stare, ignore, bully, or ridicule him. The only kindness he experiences is in his own delusional mind with a female neighbor in his apartment complex. When some of the city's programs are cut, he loses access to his social worker and his medications. He is alone and suffering from extreme mental illness.<br/><br/>It is not hard to understand what drives him to anger and violence. Again, it does not justify his behavior, but it is not hard to see how he gets to that point.<br/><br/>I am reminded of the powerful quote: ""Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about."" If only more people adopted this mantra in the world we live in, perhaps it would be a happier place.<br/><br/>(2) Just like physical illnesses, mental illness is not a choice. Arthur does not like his circumstances; he did not choose to be this way. He has a strong attachment to his mother and is shown caring for her as she is weak and suffering from various physical and mental ailments. There are tender moments when he is cutting up her food and bathing her where it is clear that he is capable of love. He has redeeming qualities, a fact I suspect is true of everyone suffering from mental illness.<br/><br/>(3) Medication does not solve mental illness. Arthur's behavior when he is on the medication is not much better than when his medication is no longer available. Pills can't fix everything, and it is time for our society to acknowledge that and work as hard at helping patients with mental illness as we do helping cancer patients and those suffering from other diseases of the body. "
4707," Incredible!
"," Amazingly well written, disturibing yet beautiful and incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Joker shines not only as a comic book movie but also as a thriller and proves that you don't need CGI to make a movie this entertaining. Gives you the feels everytime something gruesome happens ans i loved it. "
4708," Heath ledger is smiling from heaven.
"," A movie that made the day of every dc fan.
Jaoquin phenoix is getting oscar for this ..finally..one of the finest acting i have ever seen. If you have never seen a dc universe movie you should watch this one...not just a comic villian movie. "
4709," AMAZING
", This movie was incredible. I love how the actor portrayed the character and how the character developed throughout the film. 
4710," Perfect Performance From Joaqu√≠n Phoenix!!
"," My favourite to win the Oscar for the best performance in a main role.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix maid Heath Ledger very proud, in my opinion one of the best role Phoenix ever made and one of the best joker.<br/><br/>When I heard they will make a origin story to the joker I was really skeptical, because in the DC comics there is no official Origin story to the joker, but Todd Phillips made a really good story and the joker still a mysterious character. üòâ<br/><br/>Sorry for my bad Englisch! "
4711," Great job
"," Great job, no comparison with previous jokers because it's different. There is a dark footprint that collapses with the empathy created for the arthur character. Arthur is weak and sick but the joker is strong. "
4712," Not funny, not comfortable. But that's kind of the point.
",
4713," Amazing!
"," Turley portrays on how broken people can be and how broken our society can become. This movie is honestly the story of a broken man who lacks the relationships of love and affection along with truth, you truly feel sorry for the character. A lot of comments were complaining about how violent the movie is but i honestly expected way worse. The story line is amazing and they acting in the movie is absolutely outstanding. Much watch this movie and truly see the story and background on why joker became the way that he is! Amazing! "
4714," A Ground-Breaking Work of Art.
"," Once in a blue moon, there comes a movie that breaks out of the typical mold and leaves a sense of you're watching something of historical proportions. This is one of those performances that will leave an impact on society now and generations to come. If this doesn't win an Oscar, I'm done supporting super hero movies. "
4715," A Dystopian ""Taxi Driver"" Set In Gotham City
"," The best movie I have seen in the last 10 years. It's utterly stunning. No wonder it's hated by the left wing media as it's a movie that makes you think and encourages debate which are two things they don't want you to do. Todd Phillips has made ""A Dystopian Taxi Driver Set In Gotham City"" and Joaquin Phoenix has delivered a performance rarely seen in any actors career. I have never rated a movie 10/10 and can't remember going to see a movie twice in five days at the cinema. See it for yourself and make your own mind up without being told what you can or can't watch or what you can or can't laugh at.
That is the whole point . "
4716," Whoa.
"," Deeply macabre, viscerally sad with poignant social commentary. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar than something is seriously amiss. The character development is remarkable and realistic from the innocence to the victim to the anti-hero. Really dug the way he used his body. The whole film is breathtaking and jaw slacking. I'm not a big DC follower, but this has me hooked, I need to see who Joker is now, knowing where he came from. It must be pure evil. Thank you Todd Phillips, thank you Joaquin Phoenix. "
4717," Outstanding!
"," This film is nothing short of a modern-day masterpiece. World-class performances, perfectly paced, amazing cinematography and deep, impactful storytelling of the highest order. Phoenix deserves the highest credit and will surely receive it. This will be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made because it has everything. A perfect ten. "
4718," Blown Away
"," Went to see it twice, I'd be up to see it a third time. What a breath taking movie. I don't think I've ever been so impressed with an actor before. The PAIN in the eyes of Joaquin Phoenix... Unbelievable. Lives up to the hype, 100%. To any negative reviews...... Nothing will please you, huh? "
4719," HOW can you NOT like this!!!!!
", This movie is a masterpiece. Its like they picked the best aspect of all previous jokers and put it in one.. p e r f e c t i o n.<br/><br/>The fact that it's more realistic makes it even better cause that was exactly what was needed. A movie showing a detailed side of him and just him.<br/><br/>Joaquin performance is excellent and breath taking even relatable at times. Brilliant.<br/><br/>I would love a second movie on it with batman getting involved and everything. 
4720," I went there thinking it was overrated, guess what? It's NOT
"," First of all, let me start with this review by saying I thought the Joker was overrated, seeing how people immediately go to the next trendy thing at the moment, and so I went there either way to have a good time with friends, and the fuss was underrated, yes this is how much I liked it.
Second of all, Joaquin WAS the joker, he wasn't only acting, it was unbelievable to see someone reincarnate such evil character but feeling what he feels and the audience was undoubtedly feeling for him and his hardships in life.
I just can't wait for the sequel and to know what it holds. "

4724," Awesome...I loved it...,,
"," Just a short review...But I loved this character study...Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding, it is dark...There is a real twist half way through to do with his mental state that pulls a real punch on the viewer... I don't think it was violent for the sake of violence to be honest, it really was just part of his story and I don't think was any where near as gratuitous as most action hero movies are... I was amazed at how you really felt for him...And I really did and the last scenes almost at fever underdog hero pitch...To the point you almost cheered with the others...But then the final scene left me feeling that NO he is just a twisted killer when the completely innocent as far as we could see,hospital staff member was killed...I actually felt that scene was purposefully added so cinema goers 'wouldn't ' leave thinking he was the next best thing..As up until that point he had only seemed to of killed those who had done him wrong in some way...But as I said my feelings of wow for this anti-hero were completely changed just in a few final moments with that what seemed senseless killing....I wonder who else felt the same... Was it because she represented another councillor who talked but actually never really listened to him..?. Anyway Amazing and Outstanding movie "

4736," Movie of The Year
"," This movie is quite an experience. I've watched it twice already and it's my favorite movie ever! Joaquin deserves everything for playing this role. He studied the mental illness 'laugh' to be better at his role. They didn't even ask him to. He did it out of pure charisma. This movie might have a lot of hate but why? This movie is not portraying violence. Joker grew up on violence. It's telling his back story never seen on big screens. I recommend this Movie! You will not doubt it! This is rated R because of murder, violence, F bombs and more "
4737," You've seen the other 10's!

4739," Joaquin Pheonix is mesmerising and incredible
"," I was gripped and couldn't take my eyes off him.
Watching him at times made me uncomfortable as his character made me cringe and feel embarrassed for him, a sure sign of how realistic his portrayal was of someone so damaged and unaware.
I loved the twists and how the story unfolded.
I wanted for people to show him compassion and just knew it wasn't going to happen.
His dancing was captivating and unexpected! And the way he contorted his body gave additional dark, but hypnotic viewing.
Excellent all round, especially as it deviated from the comic book stuff in a very captivating way.
Loved it. Loved him.
Joaquin Pheonix you are one talented, alluring man!
Todd Phillips thank you for a fantastic film. "
4740," intelligent: our routine living behavior disguises our wrong behavior
"," Never seen better acting performance than Alpacino in Scent of a Woman until Joaquin Phoenix's in the joker...bravo.
The openning scene was the full movie,dark tone as introduction, &amp; Arthur "" joker "" struggles to put a smile on his face with a single tear, then go to do his job in a perfect way like a man who respects his career, a joker who dances in playfull happy way to put smiles on peoples face, teen kids on the street run into him and take his sign board he runs after them in a very funny way like a kid, then they break the sign board on his head and start beating him, he gets on the floor all of pain but as a joker he must end the scene with a joke so he presses a buttom on his jacket to release a water ...hahaha.<br/><br/>throught all this pain and struggle and in the middle of no where &amp; under the eyes of feelingless people the joker ends his joke scene.
&amp; the rest of the movie is delusion.<br/><br/>this movie is amazing you can consider it as a comic, original story, bieng related to batman or not, or just a movie about a mans journey through a desease.<br/><br/>it changes the way you look at people and teaches you how to be patient with all types of people and give them excuses until a certain point where there is no actual cure.<br/><br/>Some illnesses are actually genetic &amp; in the DNA, and to a certain level there is a cure. but this cure needs all parts of the society to share thier part in the process.<br/><br/>well...if the whole joker movie bieng all delusional and just in the head of a sick person in a hospital or not this movie is amazing to watch.

This a shut up call to all those whoever doubted Joaquin as he has proved to what extent he can go to. I mean this is the MOST awesome and immersive cinema ever. Also the credit goes to the director who had the audience glued to their seats the whole movie time. Hats off for such an amazing movie which will be remembered for ages to come. A must must must watch. 
4745," Brilliantly Demented
"," Not only one of the most brilliant and thought provoking films of the year, but also one of the most well made, Joker stands atop any other comic book inspired film this year by truly delving into an area so often shied away from and shining every step of the way. Joaquin Phoenix gives a breathtaking performance as Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, and truly is the main force carrying this film through. That being said however, the film has so much more to offer. From its stunning soundtrack, wonderful cinematography, provocative storytelling, and by far phenomenal acting, the film hits home on almost every remark. The film may seem a bit slow with pacing, but it's interesting enough to carry you along, especially with never truly knowing what may come next. In the end, Todd Phillips Joker is a brilliant masterpiece that is better than it has any right to be. Let's just hope the Oscars think the same, because by God does this film deserve some.
My Rating: 10/10 "
4746," First Viewing 8/ Second Viewing 9
"," This movie benefits from a second viewing. You can really get into the film rather than getting into what the film does and doesn't do to meet your expectations based on what people are saying.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix DOMINATES the screen, this film is also technically great.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing it at least twice to get all you can from it.<br/><br/>First viewing 8/10
Second Viewing strong 9/10 "
4747," It's not my kind of Joker.
"," It's not a bad movie but not a Joker I would expect. Joker shall be crazy, sophisticated, delusional lunatic with sadistic attitude, bad to the bone - not pity little psychopath abused in childhood who happened to be walk into wrong subway train....No, its not my Joker. it must be crazy difficult to walk into character defined before by Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, and it must be admitted that Joaquin Phoenix is great in what the script of the movie brings on the Joker. I love to see him as a grown up Joker. Joker laughter made by Joaquin is from now on iconic for me. "
4748," 1 hell of a ride watched twice 2 understand it
"," Joker is absolutely an instant Classic and Phoenix should win an oscar for his mind blowing performance. This movie should have been called Arthur Instead of joker Cuz Phoenix played Arthur fleck in this movie and showed how an innocent Human being turned Evil. Because DC has named it Joker, people are comparing it with heath ledger and all that but the matter of fact is that this was an Arthur fleck role and not the Iconic joker... Its basically like Darth Vader and Anakin skywalker. So there is no comparison. But this is an incrdible origin movie and OMG the Ending...... "
4749," Oscar worthy 100%
"," I don't even know where to start. The directing, the character build up, the camera angles and of course the brilliant performance of Joaquin Phoenix make this a package deal for the Oscars. I haven't seen such a raw movie in a long time. "

"," Go and see this film. A masterpiece, no CGI, just a great story and amazing acting from JP.. if he doesn't get the Oscar it will be a compete travesty. "
4751," One of the best film of 2019
"," People exaggerate this film to be ""masterpiece"" as it is not a masterpiece but it's great character study film and I won't overhyped this film to be one. These film sees Todd Philips takes on different genre as he occasionally makes comedy film but this film is by far the deepest film of his. The Joker does take on the society aspects which can be relate into today's world but these film focus more on Arthur Fleck with his creepy dance and laugh which tells about his condition. Joaquin Phoenix is great as ever and he deserve to win an Oscar this time. Overall, it's great, thrilling and deep. "

"," A true character study, brilliantly executed. Casting, acting, cinematography, score, script, everything is close to perfection, one of the best films of the year, and probably of the decade. Unexpected in a lot of ways, brilliantly unexpected. "
4755," So... that's it? *Very mild spoilers*
"," All these 10's out here made me curious to how this film was going to end while I was watching it, cause the build-up was really just plain and predictable. The director ads some ""twists"", but these could be found in the trailers already, so there were actually no twists at all. Phoenix is good, but to be honest not terrific in my opinion. The writers of this film want the main character to act as if he's entering a new stage of insanity every 15 minutes of the film or so, but it felt like it was just mors of the same with finally a big step into insanity in the final act.<br/><br/>Sure, you should watch this. As this film has a unique storytelling aspect that pretty much none of all the other comic book movies ever had. But I was kinda let down at the end by the fact that I wanted to see some more consequences at city-level. Cause this was just the same rioting scene as in TDKR and by that not very original and even disappointing.<br/><br/>6/10 and I wouldn't watch this again probably "
4756," Breathe of fresh air
"," It takes a serious change in the way movies have predictability. Loved this movie beginning to end, amazing performance. "
4757," A Instant Classic!
"," I got everything I wanted out of a joker orgin film. Its unsettling, intense, and doesn't hold back. Jaquin Phoenix as the joker is Oscar worthy and in my mind goes head to head with Heath Ledger's take on the character &amp; maybe even above. This film is a film of the year candidate without a doubt. A must see "
4758," Pros and cons
"," Pros:
Original story, really powerful themes about class imbalance, mental illness, how much you can really take from someone, etc.
Crazy good acting for Arthur, every movement is planned to capture the image of someone discovering their role in the world
Character design for Joker is so good, the design of his followers works great<br/><br/>Cons:
Love interest subplot was just bad, they totally could've told the story of Arthur trying to find warmth in the world differently
Thomas Wayne storyline left something to be desired, did not have satisfying closure
Fake tension violin sound in legitimately tense scenes were not welcome<br/><br/>Best part: Murray Franklin show, great dialogue and great way to solidify the transformation from Arthur to Joker
Worst part: love interest ending, unnecessary and unwelcome "
4759," This movie is kinda all over the place.
"," The first act of this movie is an absolute mess. When you give a character every mental illness in the book, the result is a character that can act completely sporadically and no one can question their motives. We are shown a character who is depressed, clearly on the spectrum, disassociative, is prone to vivid hallucinations, has ptsd from abuse as a child, and so on. All of these ailments stack up, one at a time, whenever it's convenient for a plot point. For example, Arthur feels no remorse after killing the wall street guys on the train. This would make sense if Arthur had exhibited any kind of psychopathic behavior leading up to that point, but he doesn't. It only makes sense because the audience knows that the Joker is a remorseless killer, and Arthur will eventually become the joker. It's backwards storytelling. If this movie wasn't an origin story to a supervillain, the character development would be total nonsense.<br/><br/>This leads me to my next point. The character development for the supporting characters is almost non-existent. Arthurs mother at the very least has a few interesting details to uncover. I was very interested in her story about Thomas wayne, and it was satisfying to learn about her troubled history through the records office. EVERY other character in the movie is utterly one-dimensional. His boss is a typical New York boss archetype, Thomas wayne is the big rich meanie archetype, the cops are cops, the wall street guys are wall street guys, the TV host is a TV host. The world feels remarkably dead. We almost have an interesting character in Arthur's hallucinated girlfriend, but all of her development is thrown out the window when we find out Arthur was hallucinating.<br/><br/>My final complaint is more trivial, I'll admit. The joker at the end of the movie is completely incapable of being the criminal Mastermind joker that we love in The Dark Night. First and foremost, the Joker is an intelligent antagonist. The Joker is ALWAYS one step ahead of the police, the gangs, and Batman. His ability to anticipate and predict situations is his most important character traits, and it's not developed in this movie at all. I understand that this joker is different, and that's fine. I respect this movie as a stand alone story, but come on. This joker could never be the antithesis to Batman. He's dumb and impulsive.<br/><br/>These complaints aside, this movie does not fail as an entertainment piece. The third act specifically is thrilling, to say the least. Phoenix did an incredible job bringing a half-baked character to life. The shots were pretty, and the closing scenes were very satisfying. At the end of the day, this movie uses our knowledge of the Joker as a crutch far too often. I wanted something more profound, but I was entertained anyway. "
4760," Totally stole the show from Avengers Endgame
"," Avengers Endgame: exists<br/><br/>Joker: I'm about to end this mans whole career<br/><br/>This film is unique for its own. This is not typical sadistic, psycho criminal Joker we know. It shows the human side of Joker. He is victim of society, the byproduct of flawed system and capitalism. In the end he is seen as hero, not the villain.<br/><br/>I like ""superhero"" films like this. This and Dark Knight have actual plot and message, not just CGI filled action trashes like 80% of MCU films.<br/><br/>Jaquin proved he is a good actor. But Heath Ledger's performance is still the best, because he stole the show from Batman and acted like a main character, despite being in the film about Batman. Heath Ledger also improvised many scenes on his own. Respect. "
4761," A true Masterpiece
"," JP performance is As good as Heath Ledger's<br/><br/>The movie is dark. It's a DC movie. It has to be dark. The way the story unravels, Stunning!<br/><br/>Todd philps direction is mind blowing.<br/><br/>This movie sets a new bar of expectations for movie hereon.<br/><br/>A must watch. Its a crime if you love DC and not watch it. Even if you are not a DC fan, just watch it to know how awesome dc universe is. üòâ "
4762," One of the best DC films ever
", So I think that Joaquin Phoenix is a better joker than heath ledger but this movie is not better than the dark knight. In my opinion I think the first 15 minutes was really dull in my opinion but after those 15 minutes I was hooked in on the movie. It's also very graphic I was shocked of what I saw in the theater. This is an A minus for me it just needs and better start but other than that it's great and I highly recommend. But I don't recommend if you have a weak stomach it gets violent during the climax of the movie. 8/10 
4763," Good, but not great
"," While Joaquin Phoenix turns in a great performance as Arthur Fleck/Joker and while the film itself is a feast for the eyes, I can't help but conclude that Joker is only a good film; greatness eludes it.<br/><br/>Even this non-comic book fan could make the obvious connections between the Wayne family and Arthur Fleck/Joker, but they're likely to be of much greater interest to longtime fans of the comics and the characters. In the end, I left the theatre happy enough to have taken in Joker, but I won't feel a need to watch it again anytime soon. You might feel differently about it of course. "
4764," Please build the DC film franchise around this movie.
"," This movie finally does the DC universe some justice. The movie was dark, unsettling, and honestly some parts were tough to watch, but the film is a masterpiece. Phoenix is amazing. This is how DC needs to be done. It was so good, I hope this isn't a one off. I really hope they scrap the Suicide Squad/Justice League failed attempt to parallel Marvel, and instead build a film franchise around this movie. Amazing. "
4765," Masterpiece!
", Just go and watch this. Movies like these come once in a while. 
4766," So relevant to the world we live in today!
"," Personally I thought it was great! A- in my book. I think it brings the climate of the world into the movie, which made it super relevant to me, but I could see it being a turn off for some people. Amazing acting and deep plot. I think it can be best described as a psychological thriller, and a really good one! "
4767," Move over Heath Ledger
"," I have been seeing video after video on YouTube explaining the ending of Joker. There is no explanation needed, if you don't understand the ending you should probably stop watching movies because you are so far disconnected from reality. I love Heath Ledger but Phoenix does an amazing job in this movie. 10/10 from me. "
4768," Not bad...but WAY over promoted to the point credibility has beed compromised
"," I am more disappointed at the build-up of this film than I am impressed with it-and it WAS good...but....no...not as good as other films out there.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix remains under-rated and under-challenged.<br/><br/>The subject matter was relevant and timely...though not accompanied by any breakthrough insights or original observations. The OVER-lying comic-strip character story-line was somewhat interesting for a bit... Otherwise...Joaquin Phoenix lost 52 pounds and like Mathew McConaughey, might sell enough tickets to get an Oscar.<br/><br/>Woo. Hoo. "
4769," Arguably THE best performance by an actor.... ever.
"," The whole thing is excellent, beginning middle and end. "
4770," The most grounded portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime, and a phenomenal performance by the great Joaquin Pheonix

4772," A milestone in the supervillian genre
"," Very few hyped-up films succeed in delivering beyond expectation-""The Joker"" is one of them. Right from the opening shot, I was hooked into the character of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) who would later become the Joker. He possesses an unsettling charm that exceeds some of the great anti-heroes in film: most notably Travis Bickle. Nothing is certain in what Fleck does and says-his addicting laughter (which is closer to a clown than any of the previous Jokers) sets him apart from society. His descent into villainy is closer to a vigilante (a l√° Travis Bickle) than a super villain. His ultimate dream to be in a talk show with his idol (ironically played by Robert De Niro)-a nod to ""The King of Comedy"" (1982). There is also a subplot revolving Arthur's mother and her alleged relationship with Thomas Wayne- which is handled very well. Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force, creating a new Joker that rivals Heath Ledger's portrayal in ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). Making this Joker into a comedian was a great idea-the aesthetic and the moral dilemmas are portrayed very well. Every scene is built up with a punchline that gives the film my praise for being the best film of this year. "
4773," Character study of a villain
"," Amazing character study of a villain. In my opinion this is the first comic film made for adults. It's a game changer.
People that don't like this film do not understand the character of the Joker. "
4774," Dark, Scary, Depressing, and Satisfying as Hell
"," Everyone wants a dark comic book adaptation but once they get it, they complain about how dark and disturbing it is. That's the point. This is a movie about a man with a very severe mental illness who has been corrupted by the world around him. This is not a superhero movie, but a deep and angry meditation on loneliness, abandonment, and being bullied. It's a very scary movie, but that's what made it so damn good. I didn't have doubts about this film and others shouldn't either. It's a pure, nihilistic, and utterly cataclysmic crime epic powered by a searing performance from Phoenix.<br/><br/>B+ "

4779," A Realistic Depiction of a Clown
", The acting is fantastic. And it is an overall good movie. But Todd Phillips writing/directing is derivative of Martin Scorsese films. 
4780," Fabulous interpretation from Joaquin Phoenix
"," The story is a little common in american action movies, which that I personally don't like. Although it's a superhero story derivate, the movie hasn't any kind of supernatural scene. The movie is full of cinematographically perfect scenes, supported by an amazing interpretation from Phoenix.
The movie has also an interesting reflection about the subjectivity of what is funny.
The movie is great but despite it all I don't think this movie deserve a Gold Lion from Venice Festival. "

through the character of the Joker before entering the criminal world on a dark journey with psychological symbols and a crazy acting from Joaquin Phoenix along with a great great great enjoyable directing from Todd Phillips. "
4786," Masterpiece

",
4790," They finally did it
"," They finally made a movie about the joker and., didn't let anyone down. "
4791," Empathy is key. Indeterminate spaces created that I appreciated a lot
"," I like sophisticated fiction that creates spaces of uncertainty within them. Whilst watching Joker, I kept on thinking of Fight Club, and I wondered why? Because it's not really like Fight Club - but it is. How one character relates to the world. And then there's the creation of the fictional character in Zazie Beetze's apparition, for Fleck. So, that's one indeterminate space that I really appreciated the whole text as creating. I found it also particularly telling that there is a scene where Fleck admits his original three murders to an admin worker, and it's references Raskolnikov's own admission in Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment beautifully, here. That text is a masterpiece of exploring existential being in a society, and so the reference was not lost on me.<br/><br/>I had empathy for Fleck, and the filmmakers did this wonderfully well. Those many reviewers that judge Fleck as a 'pathetic' and 'sad' 'incel' figure have already objectively judged him, I feel. Empathy at that point of judgment renders empathy not really possible, in my opinion. Much is missed out on. A much more interesting question is how are those actions reached, empathetically? Todd Phillips has given us a very good exploration, that references, and the text is richly complex. I had a good time here. "
4792," Brilliant!
", That's all I have to say.<br/><br/>BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>Absolutely brilliant. 
4793," DC Version of American Psycho
"," I've been of a Joker since Jack Nicholson, I still think Heath Ledger is the best version of Joker in a movie, but Joaquin Phoenix is another masterpiece. His act as a Joker brings a heartfelt to the audience, Phoenix doesn't need too much dialogue to make the audience feel the sadness, his eyes and his laugh is enough to feel the desperate and sadness in Joker. At some point, the notebook that Joker brings which contain his handwriting of sadness and anger kinda reminds me of American Psycho (actually it's kinda different). Heath will smiling from above when he sees his friend gives the audience an outstanding performance.
To OSCARS board, just give the award to Joaquin, HE TOTALLY DESERVES IT "
4794," Absolutely stunning!
"," Nothing like it! A must watch for sure! Please understand that this is not for children. This is an adult movie, with strong adult themes. But with that, this is also not a typical Joker. This is about the mental destruction of a man in which society pushes him over the edge, making him the person he is today. "
4795," Please watch this movie
"," What a masterpiece movie. Joaquin phoenix made the joker so real. Loved it. Please watch this movie , you cannot afford to miss this one.I thought nobody can relive Joker after what Heath Ledger had done but oh boy!!! Joaquin phoenix made me laugh, made me cry, made me fear....

4800," Dark, Mind Bending and Thought provoking
"," The Joker is that kind of a movie which will stick around in your mind.
It's gonna make you ask questions, about morality, sanity and comedy.
As a whole, Joker isn't for the weak of mind or the weak of soul.
Joaquin Phoenix delivers a performance that keeps the audience hooked on to him, he gets just the right amount of apathy and sympathy.
The beauty of the movie lies in the layers that are moulded into it, on its surface it may be hard to understand, however it is one to spike a chain of critical thoughts.
Finally Phoenix's Joker is not the anarchist or rebel or psychopath or gangster that Ledger or Romero or Leto or Nicholson gave us, he is a true evil person, but a human none the less. Phoenix's Joker bridges the gap that the common person might feel that he has from the Joker. He showed how everyone of us has to capability to become the Joker.
Both Joaquin and Phillips have delivered a movie that will be remembered for generations to come. "
4801," Astonishing Performance
"," One of the best movies I have ever seen, amazing acting from Joaquin phoenix, he was the perfect person for this role 10/10 of course for Cinematography, Music and everything, I highly recommend to watch this masterpiece. "

It reminds me about taxi driver (ronert deniro) "
4804," Outstanding Movie
"," An outstanding movie with an outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Joker is the closest and more reminiscent to the Joker what it should be. He surely deserves an Oscar for this. The story is well written and considering the vague origin story of Joker provided by DC, this movie will make you feel that this story could possibly be one of the origin story of Joker which one could believe. "
4805," Trust me, I GET movies. I've seen The Critic.
"," This film made me whinny and buck around the theater like a bronco in heat. I side swiped like 4 people in my pony-like state. All the food I eat now tastes like sugar and hay. My hair flows longer and longer as my hooves clop against the city streets. The frontier is gone, stone shapes the steets that used to be dust and dirt. Let me hoof it to a pasture where I can be my own master. The only thing I can lose are my chains. "

4808," It's never be the same again. Joker could be real 9/10
"," The performances by Joaquin Phoenix will makes you uncomfortable, dizzy, very disturbing, and u will never forget his LAUGH in this film. I bet many viewers (adult) can't stand this film, its hard to watch, but from the start we all know that this is NOT a comic boom JOKER movie. Enjoy it if you can. "
4809," Joker
", This is a very disturbing character study of a man named Arthur Fleck. Phoenix really gets under the characters skin and is very convincing trying to make it as a stand up comic. The film is beautifully shot and has a great soundtrack. The film has some really disturbing images and is not for people who can not take graphic violence. It is a great portrait of society that has gone bad. Phoenix performance is Oscar worthy. This film is one of the best of the year. It has beautiful images shocking violence and a incredible character study. 
4810," Oh my God !
"," No matter how many times I tell you this movie is spectacular, you won't believe it. Joker has exceeded my expectations. It's beautifully dark and disturbing. No doubt that this is Joaquin phoenix's best performance of all time "

", Just saw the movie and all I can say is that it is truly a masterpiece 
4812," A true masterpiece of a movie
"," THis movie has got me awestruck, amazing direction, cinematography and Bgm. But most of all the acting is just top notch. Felt the pain, felt the seclusion of an individual. Movies got to move you and make you feel the emotions. Tood Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have just hit the ball out of the park.
Watch the movie to know and feel what happens when everything goes wrong but u still need to smile.
A true example of a masterpiece, do not miss. "
4813," I felt like a psychopath and it felt good
"," This movie was ""SO ART"" for me, I felt so deeply sad and then for a few seconds I felt happy and then again sad. In fact Joaquin Pheonix made me feel in so many ways I can't even describe. I think I felt like a psychopath, I felt him, I felt his rage and all those negative emotions. Details like microexpressions, oh god, wonderful, and the acting overall and the music, yes, the music + acting... ugh.Then the END came and I got out of words, it was... astonishing. I am sure there are people who will get bored because it's not a movie made for all to understand. It may not be perfect but for me, at last, it's very close to perfection.<br/><br/>10/10 "
4814," Joaquin Phoenix at his best
"," Just finished the movie at cinema and the whole cinema was quiet and seems in deep thoughts that how a normal person turns to be that monster and inspiration for oppressed community.
Joaquin Phoenix at his best, music and the way movie was directed were awesome.
Society plays very huge role in building the healthiness of people. "
4815," A BOLD MASTERPIECE
", The best DC film till date. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of joker was spot on. A must watch for every comic fan. 
4816," Summary: This world is lacking empathy.
"," You loved heath ledger as joker right?
Well, you'll fall for Joaquin Phoenix the moment the movie begins. There is not even a single second of off-screen time and this guy, he has nailed every bit of it. The laughter, the choking during the laughter and the whole psychotic aura of his, it is mind blowing. Well, he deserves an Oscar for what he has done as joker. This is the movie of the decade, for me. "
4817," Magnum Opus!
", What a brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Surely his act deserves an Oscar. I wish Heath Ledger would be proud &amp; smiling from heaven seeing Joaquin. Thank you DC for giving us such a masterpiece movie. 
4818," Redemption of character
"," Yes. Finally it happend. After Heath Ledger's beautiful performance and Jared Letos quite let down - we have Joaquin Phoenix who has made our beloved character into something we all can love for what it is. A surprising, unexpected and dangerous - Joker. And also.. he has a story now! Truly beautiful performance! Definitely Oscar nominee - best picture and best actor! "
4819," Brilliant character representation and Joaquin's best performance
"," Grab a seat, free your heart and calm your mind because this movie is silent like a lake but it will hit you like a meteorite fell right in the centre of that lake. Todd's take on Joker is raw and real.<br/><br/>I just wish this movie was longer but as a drama piece it is perfect. Joaquin is a masterpiece. I hope they don't merge it with DCEU. "
4820," What a complete and total waste of time.
", Was this suppose to be entertainment? What a waste. Can't believe so many idiots think this is quality entertainment. Must be a bunch of Antifa socialists. 
4821," Not a good movie
"," Good acting, slow development, predictable ending. Sourtimes you want to sleep. Early phase of becoming joker fantasie. "
4822," Heath who?
"," One in four people will experience mental illness in their lifetime, but only a very small percentage of those will pose any sort of danger to anyone other than themselves. Hopefully, as more people talk about openly about mental health, stigma will decrease, and all those in need of help will get the treatment they require.<br/><br/>There will, of course, always be cases that slip through the net with tragic results, people like Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), whose fragile psyche is the result of a lifetime of hurt: a victim of child abuse, a victim of violence, a victim of intolerance, a victim of circumstance, a victim of inequality, and a victim of a society that doesn't care. No longer functioning as a rational human being (his access to meds having been taken away), Fleck confuses reality and fantasy, is prone to outbursts of extreme violence, and dances wildly to inappropriate pop music from the '70s.<br/><br/>With a tour-de-force performance from Phoenix, whose turn as the green-haired villain is both sympathetic and terrifying, plus stylish direction from Todd Phillips, and an intelligent script that is, by turns, funny, sad, exciting, and horrific, Joker is a refreshingly bold attempt to do something with a well known comic-book character that doesn't involve expensive CGI-laden battles.<br/><br/>9/10. The only part that I didn't like was where it is revealed that Arthur's relationship with his pretty neighbour has been a figment of his imagination. I think most people would have got this without the need to spell it out for them. "
4823," A bit disappointed
"," First thing first, I personally like this film, but I wish it can had more dynamics on politics and the disparity, it just feels like it wasn't there yet, all those struggling and revolutionary concepts were kind of cartoonish to me, and the dialogues right before Arthur shoot Murray were too blatant, no character can be this self-aware, not even Arthur.<br/><br/>But the cinematography and the soundtrack in this film is breathtaking, and Joaquin Phoenix is just phenomenal in this film, he's such a brilliant actor, I won't compare him with Heath Ledger because both of them did an absolutely amazing job, I almost can't believe my own eyes.<br/><br/>Though I had some problems with this film, I still really appreciate this movie for being existed, there aren't enough films like this in Hollywood nowadays, especially in the superhero genre. I hope we can see more movies like this in the future, which the directors and the writers were actually trying to make a ""good"" movie, with no CGI involved and actually care about the characters and the visuals, not just some cash grab digital cinema, but a ""real film"" with some talented storytelling and masterful visual choreography.<br/><br/>Thank you, Todd Phillips, for giving us this unique experience. "
4824," Well made.. but lacking in real meaningful development
", When they say dark.. they really mean it. But I guess some people really like going to those dark evil places. Acting was strong and some cool stylistic things going on.. but it just seemed to celebrate violence. Yes it's just a movie.. but I guess I'm not a fan of violence with no real world effects. Also Joker really seemed to switch so quickly.. I thought there would be more about how and why he turned so evil. Some missed opportunities to make the film really mean something greater. 
4825," Great Joker Monologue
"," This movie means nothing without Joaquin's acting (obviously). The script, music and FX were lazy. "
4826," Compelling, but ultimately disappointing.
"," This character study, mainly the focus of the origins and psyche of the popular comic book villain doesnt quite work for me , apart from some good acting performances and a well written script, the picture is a little boring and pretentious, we all know the joker is crazy but this portrayal is too grim and feels too detached from the DC universe, nothing wrong with leaf pheonix performance of the joker ,its different and interesting but too dark for a comic book villain , for some reason this film brought the machinist (christian bale )to mind , but despite the actors great efforts id say its the most unmemorable performance of the actors who portrayed the villain over the years. The movie is like a cross of the king of comedy (1982) and taxi driver(1976) both scorsese and deniro movies , ironically de niro co stars in this.
Could be pretty good if you watch it with an open mind ,it offers something a bit different in this genre but this addition doesnt work for me 6/10 so... so "
4827," Disgusting movie!
"," This movie show how ill is today's society. Yes, Phoenix played awesome his role. But the whole movie was terrible and hard to watch. Sorry for lost 2 hours in my life to watch it. I expected from this to be action movie like batman series not a movie for mental ill person and tragically story "
4828," Hated this movie.
"," Hated everything about this movie, except Phoenix's performance. Too long and slow paced. Director tried to do an ""artsy"" take on the comic book genre and in my opinion, he completely missed the point. Joker is a character invented more than 60 years ago, throwing away all that history is an insult to all comic book lovers "
4829," Wow - this is overrated
"," Maybe it because I¬¥m not a Joker fan, but the melancholy and depression in this movie is just to much. I feel like the movie has one message, feel bad. And Jerad Leto¬¥s Joker was a bit more fun, in a non fun kind of way.<br/><br/>I just don¬¥t like when movies try to hard to be ""artsy"" and deep, especially when it¬¥s a Batman villain.<br/><br/>And also the hole ""feel bad for the bad guy"" thing might have worked for Thanos, but not for the Joker.<br/><br/>I was so bored that I almost left the theater. But that is just me, obviously a lot of people like it so good for them :). I am truly glad for there sake. :) "
4830," Painful.
"," This is a painfully drawn out film about a person suffering from severe emotional trauma. It is difficult to watch - unmoving and overall trifling. In simple terms, my wife dragged me for it. I would never have watched. I am surprised people loved it. Maybe they are paying homage to the lineage of films and so on.<br/><br/>JP is a great actor. He takes his roles seriously. But I won't mind never seeing another film featuring him. He should be a stage actor in 1882. Bye. "
4831," Boring af movie
"," There's about 12 seconds of action in this entire slogfest of a film, but I guess congrats to Joaquin for getting rail skinny. "
4832," Boring
"," Some other critic described the movie as ""A boring decent into madness."" I agree. Essentially a movie about the development of the Joker character without giving him an antagonist or purpose to hang a plot on. An anti-hero without a cause results in a very boring movie. "
4833," MUST not WATCH

4835," Really funny
", I did not really like this movie I thought it was gonna be great but it just never clicked at all 
4836," Unimaginative
"," First of all let me say this movie is over-hyped and over rated, whether people say its a masterpiece for popularity reasons,because everyone else says it is because they wanted to prove critics wrong or because most of these people don't have a high enough IQ to see how mediocre it was..<br/><br/>My perfect joker was already done by Heath Ledger. A villain with a twisted,dark,crafty,messed up mind that doesn't play by other peoples rules. Someone who doesn't conform to society and doesn't fit in,who would rather see the world burn and uses his dark mentality and twisted sense of humor to enact these thoughts and feelings out on everything and everyone. A freak who doesn't care if hes a freak and can out-wit out-do Batman at every turn. To me the person who would become joker isn't a simpleton..and sad pathetic idiot who doesn't understand the world,people or himself. This man would not be a looser who lives with his mother and struggles to get by.. An average joe who uses simple normal people vices to deal with his reality. (smoking,drink ect) Who's only unique quality is a bizarre laugh and even that was an accident that he had no say in and can't even control..No..this is not the mentality or the attitude or the way the mind breaks down.
The person who wrote this script has zero understanding of mental illness,mental disorders,psychology or human behavior. Typical Hollywood to just throw a movie together that seems as if it was written by a high school student and have everyone praise it.
The actor did a ok job just like hes done in other movies but he was way too old for the part. If Bruce Wayne was 8-10 when joker was 40+ then that means he would be fighting an 50-60+ year old man.. What a joke that is! Ha! Phoenix had that laugh down but the parts where he started laughing uncontrollably was just hard to watch;it was awkward and drawn out and not creepy,interesting or unique.. Besides that he just brought a pathetic childishness to the character (which may have been what the director wanted) but to me just served to belittle the name of Joker even more.
The score was terrible..The same loongg..drawn out...cello/violin tune..over and ovveerr! The same song multiple times..As if you couldn't hire someone better to make an actual score for the movie that was going to make you millions..<br/><br/>The redeeming part was the delusions about the woman but to me even that was obvious it was in his head. I mean.. you stalk a woman all day and she's going to invite you in to her place?? RIGHT... I liked the scene with his old co-workers near the end but then again that's when he was really turning into Joker and the mentality and actions fit. I also thought how they made the Joker the key that started the riots and protests and that's what led to Bruce Wayne's parents dying. But since there was already an origin for that it really didn't add much to the story. And we have all seen that scene a thousand times..Also, I liked his crazy dancing and how he kept his clown behavior through the movie and that's what relates to the Joker makeup and so on which helps things come full circle.<br/><br/>Overall i was vastly upset that they went this sloppy boo-hoo direction and i will forgot about this movie in an hour lol. It has zero lasting potential for me. In conclusion..<br/><br/>This was written by simple people for simple people and there is nothing grand,great or imaginative about it. 4/10 at the best. "

4843," The Joker is supposed to be a diabolical mastermind. Not a clown.
"," This movie makes him out to be a nervous child with pseudobulbar affect (pathological laughter). I understand what the movie is trying to point out, but it would have worked for me if it was not connected to the joker or dc comics. The Joker is a brilliant and ruthless criminal mastermind, so much of a genius Batman is the only one who can match him. This ""origin"" story does not create a Joker that could ever hope to be Batman's greatest enemy. He causes mass chaos in the city by mistake. A very slow burn for a very weak payoff, the ending should have been in the middle of the movie and gone from there. His makeup is that of a clown the entire movie never bearing any resemblance to any Joker i've ever seen. I can't enjoy a character who is ONLY a mental case, he is terrible at being funny, Heath Ledger's joker was hilarious without trying to be a comedian, he was funny in the moment, this Joker is too disturbed for comedy. A character like the Joker doesn't need an origin story it should be left shrouded in mystery. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with what it all was, but it felt more like Taxi than anything else which to some is a success but I feel it's a failure in this case. "

"," The pacing of the movie is incredibly slow for the first hour as the movie tries its hardest to humanise Joaquin's character and elicit sympathy from the audience. It gets repetitive as the same themes are drilled over and over again. The manic laugh was haunting the first couple of times. Then it gets really old, really fast to the point that it loses all its intended impact. The makeup and wardrobe choice for The Joker is just far too comical for it to be believable and to have that edginess that would complement the character. It's not all entirely bad, there are a couple of good moments towards the end which I won't divulge but save to say, they are just enough to bring this movie just above a mediocre watch. "

4856," Valid Point Irresponsibly Communicated
"," Joker will be a keystone project in the careers of many of the crew; the score, cinematography, lighting design, costuming, and much more were all brilliantly done. Of course, Phoenix's performance exceeds remarkable. However, I take a lot of issue with the messages illustrated in the film.<br/><br/>The film opens with a news story about garbage accumulating in the city to the point of major health hazard. We later learn there has been a garbage strike, and it becomes more and more clear that Gotham's wealthy are to blame for the literal and societal filth that plagues the city. This is a valid point. Thomas Wayne is the city's villain. He looks down on the impoverished people of Gotham and says, ""Accept me as your savior or take on the responsibility of making something of your lives."" We have seen this abuse of privilege in actual American politics.<br/><br/>My issue arrises in how the villain is taken down. Arthur Fleck clearly struggles with serious mental health challenges, and the municipal government has clearly not prioritized providing him support, but the viewer is forced to empathize with his journey to becoming a psychotic killer and at no point does there seem to be an option for Arthur to make an effort to seek personal healing or more appropriate coping mechanisms. And so, Arthur accepts his mental illness as the core of his identity, becomes Joker, aimlessly starts a violent movement against the systematic violence of shoddy infrastructure, inspires the killing of the villain, and is exalted by his peers. This is a valid point irresponsibly communicated.<br/><br/>Many great conversations could come from this film. For one, we can consider that Joker's life parallels that of many superheroes; after a personal tragedy, superheroes employ retributive violence to ""solve"" society's problems, and they are then exalted by their peers. Even Bruce Wayne, who could invest his billions in wide-scale systematic change, ultimately chooses to instead dress as a bat and beat up the poor, disturbed people of Gotham. Additionally, the end scene of Joker calls into question our culture's over-valuing of happiness. We often hear the phrase, ""I just want you to be happy,"" but for Arthur, the first time he experiences happiness is when he remorselessly murders. Is the means justified by the end? Should we care about peoples' happiness more than their deeper wellbeing? So, there is a lot of potential for people to wrestle with the dissonance this film creates. However, I am aware that, sadly, the average film viewer is not a responsible consumer and will not have important debrief after watching this film. Even more concerning, the film is emotionally escalating and does not send a responsible message to those who don't search deeper than art's surface. I think there is legitimate concern that Joker could incite a real-world movement, or at least a violent outburst here and there from unhealthy patrons. "
4857," complete mess...
", Oustanding performance by Phoenix...wrong character selection.the joker charachter was never a crying little boy who lost his mommy..shame really ...maybe next time try picking Robocop and make him a pseudo anarchist!We got your message I must say...but what did the joker character had to do with it i wonder... 
4858," A dark city, the subway, and urban stress. Nothing new. Joaquin Phoenix much better as a Commodus in Gladiator.
"," A dark city, the subway, and urban stress. Nothing new. Joaquin Phoenix much better as a Commodus in Gladiator.<br/><br/>Enough said. "
4859," Waste of time
"," I can't explain how bad the movie was. All this hype, and it was a major let down. I thought Heath Ledger was bad as the joker, but Phoenix is totally unwatchable.<br/><br/>This movie was a total waste of an afternoon. "
4860," A disturbing take on the Joker.
"," The Joker for me was a disturbing and sometimes hard to watch revision of the Joker that not many of us saw coming, Phoenix brought a great effort to the table, but it was somewhat miss-placed for hysteria and mental illness. The Joker has always been known to be cunning, intelligent and calculating so I was surprised they made the Joker out to be so spontaneous and mentally unfit considering what we know he is capable of in a myriad of comics and movies. I do not see this version of the Joker outwitting Batman and the city of Gotham's authorities, he seems to be far too convoluted in the sense that people get to him mentally and emotionally far too easily, he is unstable and not intellectual. Heath Ledger's Joker was and always will be the pinnacle of the Joker, the perfect balance of humor, wit and insanity, it should go without saying. This Joker was just too weird and disturbed to be anything but a sideshow freak. "
4861," It could've been so much better...
",
4862," INDEPENDENT DARKNESS
"," Joker is an escape into a sociopathic dark drama produced as an independent film with a big budget cast. Todd Phillips wrote , produced and directed this cinematic catastrophe. Phoenix was brilliant in the portrayal of a broken-hearted villain, he simply read the script he was paid for. The concern returns to Todd Phillips. His filmography includes a variety of B movie comedies, Old School &amp; Hangover being his claim to fame. Joker is not a comedy or an action throwback to the DC comics. Joker is a dismal depressing depiction from a director who is obviously illustrating his own internal darkness. "
4863," Overrated
"," Well, I'll be quick and straight to the point. This movie is overrated, Joaquin Phoenix does a really great interpretation but that's it. Too much hype on the violence in the film, but I think it was weak. They need to add more violence and darkness to make it a really impressive movie. "
4864," Does not worth that many good reviews
", Compare to other great movies this one is just too shallow 
4865," Call me crazy but we've been here before
"," It seems everyone loves this movie as though it was citizen Cain. Maybe I missed it but it juts lacked a few things. The story is so simplistic I told my friend how it would end in the first ten minutes. This isn't a movie about Joker it's about how good Joaquin is. Yes, he's great but putting Marlon Brando in a movie didn't mean it was a great movie. Of all the things that could create the Joker they went with mental illness and childhood trauma. Those seems like what would be suggested in the first pitch but they could have been more creative. I know the director wanted to create a mood but it's like he just went too far to make his point. He dances and makes sad faces, we get it. And what about sub plots? Well, those don't exist. The only tension created is wondering when he would go full joker and even then it wasn't very satisfying.<br/><br/>Let's not forget that the Joker rivals Batman in intelligence. But this Joker is dumb and not some criminal genius. Yes he's evil buy being evil doesn't make a criminal mastermind. I was hoping for so much more. "
4866," Uncomfortable
"," Impressive, but very uncomfortable. Twisted soul in the joker/loser's body. Dark movie, sad story "
4867," It's just a boring drama

Just very boring. "

"," If you love, care for, help, or just walked passed someone that struggles with mental health issues this movie spits in their face. This IS NOT The Joker. The Joker is fully aware, and loves every ounce of chaos he causes, this steaming pile of garbage takes any and all responsibility for what The Joker does and drops the blame square on the shoulders of mental health struggles he inherited from his mother, and pushed to the extreme by society. Every single criticism, or controversial review of this movie is completely justified. Oh, for Batman fans, Todd Phillips turned Thomas Wayne into Donald Trump. "
4871," Style over substance. An ""Instagram"" masterpiece. An average movie.
"," Joker movie is very interesting because it really reflects the era we are living in. Everything is about style, superficiality. Nothing about the substance, depth.<br/><br/>In that sense, Joker achieved to be an imagery masterpiece ......but with no depth or substance.<br/><br/>Instagram boys will love it.
Men reading books will be disappointed<br/><br/>Let's talk about the positive first. As I mentioned, the imagery, the details to the visual environment is incredible. You really are transported into the depressing world of the Joker, of the old Gotham City (New York if you prefer).
The storyline is fluid, building tension all along. Even though the movie fails in the depth category, and I'll come to that down below, it is very enjoyable.
The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is great. He totally emerged himself in the Joker, even physically, loosing much wait. Which makes him a totally believable Joker.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about what's really missing and where the moving completely fails.
The Joker is probably one of the worst, if not, the worst vilain in the DC comics universe. He has no super powers, but his craziness and his intelligence makes him the most dangerous of all. He has no limits.<br/><br/>And this is where the movie fails if you consider that this is a full length movie about the Joker. To go deeper, to explain why he is what he is, not superficially, but in his mind. Being beaten with a crazy mother is not enough to explain the Joker. Many children are beaten and have crazy parents.<br/><br/>The movie fails to explain what makes him so crazy and so intelligent at the same time.What books did he read ? How does he know so much about human nature, about psychology ? How did he learn to be so manipulative ? What makes him the worst psychopath ever ?<br/><br/>In essence, what exactly destroyed him in a very detailed manner.
And what build him (his skills, intelligence) in a very detailed manner.<br/><br/>Again, you do not become the Joker just by being beaten while a child, then working as a clown in the street and then killing people.
You become the Joker by living the extremes in life : self destruction and self development.<br/><br/>The Joker from Heath Ledger had more depth than the one from Joaquin Phoenix. Period.<br/><br/>If there's a Joker 2 (and I've heard they're talking about doing it), I hope they will fill this huge gap. "
4872," Okay, not great.
"," So I went into the movie with high expectations due to the amount of of great reviews, I thought it was okay. Honestly, the movie made me feel uncomfortable. "
4873," Not Much of a plot
"," Visual feast. Colorful. But there isn't much of a plot, which kind of ruins the underlying suspence. What Will happen? We all ready know.<br/><br/>Well there are a few plot twists, which makes me in a good mood. But still, the story is not gripping.<br/><br/>Phoenix in the lead is good. But sometimes it feels to much Taxi Driver. Watching the world on telly, staying Inside your apartment in an lonely New York (Gotham).<br/><br/>I like the score. The intensity is great. A few scenes is great (The Jokers tv-show appearence is intriguing, to say the least).<br/><br/>A bit Slow and Dull. Not a movie you watch twice. "
4874," Not much to laugh about
"," MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ...<br/><br/>Joker is a VERY predictable film that openly plagiarised other films, particularly Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY and Brad Anderson's THE MACHINIST, and whoever choose the totally inappropriate music score needs shooting.<br/><br/>Joker is a hard watch, NOT, because of its action (or distinct lack of it), but because it is VERY dark and just depressing throughout.<br/><br/>Not a lot of thought seems to have gone into this picture which based around a very flimsy, simplistic plotline.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a socially inept, grotesque and emanciated outcast living at home with his ailing Mother, works as a children's clown and as a part time human advertising slogan board for local two-bit shops and businesses. He suffers from a medical condition (evidently a form of Asperger's syndrome) that causes him to laugh manically and uncontrollably at the most inappropriate times getting him into a series of sticky situations and violent beatings.<br/><br/>Arthur's only hope for salvation (he believes) is to succeed in comedy - an art at which he sucks. His hero is the talk show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro - in an almost mirror image of his portrayal in Martin Scorsese's KING OF COMEDY).<br/><br/>The frequent beatings continue unabated, until eventually (and so VERY predictably) the worm turns ... and Arthur (whilst still in his clown's make-up) fights back and kills three assailants on a subway train ... which, (inexplicably) leads to a sizeable faction of down and outs and criminals in Gotham City rising up, to praise the ""Killer Clown"" and they start rioting against society.<br/><br/>Murray Franklin notices Arthur in one of his show's audience and chats to him on-stage, leading to what Arthur believes a connection between them.<br/><br/>The Gotham riots continue support of the Killer Clown antics and killings which escalate and get much closer to home after Arthur loses his job.
Eventually, Arthur gets his dream big break, with a guest slot on the Murray Franklin show ... but, by now, he wants to be introduced as Joker.
When Joker realises that he is being laughed AT rather than laughed WITH, the Joker takes a terrible revenge.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Joker, as a film ... quite simply ... JUST DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, into what COULD HAVE BEEN, with a bit more forethought and a much better script/director, an intriguing insight into what would be the REAL motivation behind what would create a character like the Joker and his ultimate downward spiral into madness.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix may have lost 24kg to play the role as the emanciated anti-hero... but, I just can't help comparing on just how much better Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson were as the Joker.

4876," Great performances BUT Okay Movie
", I thought that Joaquin gives a amazing performance. He should be nominated for an Oscar. The performances in Joker are great from all actors. I think as a whole the movie is average. The second half of the movie is better then the first half. I think the last 20-30 mins of the movie are the best part. It wasn't as dark as I thought it would be but it's a fine movie. I think what makes Joker such a great villain is that he doesn't really have a backstory. I think you could of made this same movie and not named it Joker and it would of made it a better movie. Just from it being set in the Batman world kinda hurt it.

4879," One of the greatest movies I've seen on cinema
"," It is a great story, with lots of plot twists. Ever since I've seen this movie I can't stop thinking about it. Great ending and one of Joaquin Phoenixs best performances. THE best joker "
4880," Shocking, downbeat and shockingly profound
"," The cinematic event of the fall season finally arrived and boy were our collective minds blown! Who would have thought that a dark comic feature from the director of the ""Hangover"" trilogy could be as popular as it currently is? Well friends, Todd Philips delivered a solid origin story for Batman's greatest nemesis and separated it from the DCEU fare with its own little universe.<br/><br/>I won't delve too much into the plot as it would spoil this masterpiece of dark cinema. The basic concept follows a down-on-his-luck man who after a series of unfortunate circumstances finally snaps and the outcome is horrifying to watch unfold.<br/><br/>After such performances by Caesare Romero, Jack Nicholson, the deliciously insane vocals of Mark Hamill and the post-humous Oscar winning performance of Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' we were all wondering what acclaimed actor Joaquin Phoenix would bring to the iconic Joker. There was some doubt over how he would top the late Heath Ledger, but if you ask me: we got the most human portrayal of this iconic villain yet. Arthur Fleck is a tormented sign-twirling salesman who is eking out a meager existence to provide for himself and his ailing mother (Frances Conroy), but when he finally has become fed up his mind cracks. His journey is a slow descent into madness that is actually heartbreaking to watch as he is a man who really has no support network to rely on and is relentlessly made the butt of the joke by his peers, Known for his intensity, Joaquin Phoenix deftly approached the character as a man who longs for a connection to the world around him and to be accepted as the person he is, but the cruel real world practically spits on him and laughs at his attempts. Phoenix broods and oozes an inner ticking time bomb that when it explodes he goes full throttle without becoming a cartoon caricature, but ""that's it! I won't take this anymore and here's what you get for how you treated me!"" I condone Arthur's actions as they are violent and should not ever be replicated in reality, but in a bizarre way we do sympathize with him since we are always in his troubled perspective.<br/><br/>The standout supporting cast include Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck, Arthur's ailing mother who holds some dark secrets that help lead to Arthur's downfall to insanity, and the great Robert De Niro as condescending TV show host Murray Franklin. First, Frances Conroy is so understated as Penny but she is a terrific foil to the more clearly unstable Joaquin Phoenix. She is caring towards him, but she has a Mrs. Bates quality to her as she relies on Arthur as her caregiver and little boy. Watching her and Phoenix's scenes is both strangely touching, but also unsettling as it is slowly unraveling as the catalyst for the film's climatic reveals about her true self. Now to Robert De Niro, where has this kind of talent been with him these past few years?! After sub-par junk like ""Dirty Grandpa"", we get a return of the De Niro from his earlier career especially the 1980s. The character of Murray Franklin and his interaction with Arthur Fleck near the close of the film echoes the largely forgotten 'The King of Comedy' which had a direct influence on this film's story. While in the Scorsese film, De Niro was the struggling comedian and the late Jerry Lewis was the snide TV host, here the roles are switched as De Niro gets to be Jerry Lewis while Joaquin Phoenix plays the struggling artist in question. The film plays with the wholesome image of De Niro throughout the majority of the film since we, like Arthur, only see Murray on TV until the third act of the film where our troubled anti-hero meets his idol. When we see the moment that helps Arthur's mind snap, we become angry at how the audience and Murray treat Arthur like a sideshow and only invite him on as a joke. The dialogue between the veteran actor and Phoenix is revealing as we watch Arthur take down Murray and the public's perception of him while De Niro attempts to hold his disturbed guest in check. However we still see his true colors as he tries vainly to humiliate Arthur on national television, but at this point in time it is futile as the persona Arthur has since adopted could care less than Arthur's more human side did. De Niro may have to let the spotlight be on Phoenix, but he never wastes a line as he verbally spars with the harsh-tongued lunatic opposite him.<br/><br/>Todd Philips and co-writer Joel Silver deftly tackled this origin story by not just adapting one of the numerous tales that the Clown Prince of Crime has told over the decades in comics and films. Here we get almost an amalgamation of different inspirations such as the infamous 'The Killing Joke' where one bad day can push certain men and women to insanity and the aforementioned Martin Scorsese drama-comedy ""The King of Comedy' mixed with a few elements from 'Taxi Driver'. Given that Scorsese was once in talks for the project, it makes sense that his influence would be felt. This is one of the greatest strengths of the narrative as the ambiance feels like being in an early Scorsese film with the coloring to the haunting musical score and particularly Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck. The character is similar to how Robert De Niro behaves in 'Taxi Driver' especially in the behavior towards his peers like Zazie Beets who is practically a stand-in for Cybil Shepard in the latter film. Though in Arthur's case, his interaction with Zazie Beets' character doesn't really copy what happens with De Niro and Shepard in 'Taxi Driver' since we find out the real truth near the climax of 'Joker'.<br/><br/>There is shocking moments of violence in the film, but I doubt we will have a repeat of what happened in Aurora, Colorado. However, I strongly encourage anyone who sees this film to remember this is a fictional film, but there are people who suffer from mental illness like Arthur Fleck and have done awful acts like him in the real world. Please DO NOT replicate this violence and cost innocent families and individuals their lives. If you are suffering from mental illness, remember there is help and it can provide some comfort.I want all to be well and be safe. "
4881," Meh..
"," This movie was very slow and drawn-out. I get what they were going for with the telling of how joker became the joker but honestly, it was on the edge of becoming a snore fest. I kept waiting for more to happen and will say the ending maybe last 10-15 mins was when it started to liven up. I get that it's a deep movie, where they really want you to see the depth of the character but I think it could of been sped up a little bit. Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job at being the joker and I think he should be in the next Batman movie for sure. This movie was neither horrible or great for me. If I had to do it over I would of waited until it came out for rent. "
4882," I mean it's kinda good but...eh
"," Now don't get me wrong, as a story about an already mentally ill man going insane, it did alright. There's good performances, you can feel the decent into madness, and the series of events that bring him there line up.
Everything that happens in the B plot, however, irks me. The uprising of nihilists makes no sense whatsoever. People who believe in nothing rioting for what they believe in? I don't buy it. Now if you want to say the uprising is more radical left...okay. But do you buy a clown killing three investors on the subway sparking a series of clown themed protests supporting the murderer? I know I don't. "
4883," Playing the Joker
"," A well made movie but one that I struggle to see the purpose. Highlighting a decline in mental health and lack of support and prevention, I don't think this an origin story was needed. Batman and Heath Ledger have already highlighted this. You have to question the impact of playing this character on the actor. Well played for sure, and a nod to previous intimations before him. I hope you're ok Joaquin. "

"," I just watch this film last night and I still recovering for the Joaquin Phoenix performance....What I just watch? Well trying to digest, for me the most impressive movie of this year, it's one of the most great presentation of the seven art I have seen in years. It's definitely an Oscar winner; the cinematography, the powerful score, the original script, the direction, the set decoration and the most important, the exquisite performance of Joaquin Phoenix, makes of this movie a real modern masterpiece. I'm thinking on going to watch it again to see it in more detail and enjoy this evolution of the Joker.

"," Very well made back story about the joker. Before the Time of Batman/Bruce Wayne. The joker aka; Arthur Fleck is a tormented victim of abuse in all shape and form. We see a sympathic character who has had enough of the system that benefits the wealthy. But we the audience feel his pain . Hopefully they will do back stories on penguin and the riddler. The cat woman with Halle Berry not good but a reboot needs to be done. Anyway I have to caution viewers it's ultra violent and disturbing. I'm predicting an Oscar nod to Phoenix, I believe he has it in the bag.I was hestitant to seeing this but being a DC/Marvel comic fan I had to give it a chance . I did however enjoy it.We also see Thomas Wayne in a different light. And let's not forget Robert D Nero.As a Johnny Carson copy. Laugh clown Laugh 10 stars. "
4905," Just hands down horrifying good
",
4906," Hands down one of the best movies I've seen.
", Joaquin Phoenix plays the part so convinngly &amp; the script is spot on. 
4907," No review does this film enough justice, it is in every way a masterpiece.
"," Jaquin Phoenix gives the most devoted, perfect performance to give the shine on what is the most brilliant movie I have seen in recent years, from the opening scene to the moment the credits role this movie is extremely hard to fault.
After Heath Ledger this part was always going to be difficult, for many obvious reasons plus his outstanding portrayal, but the new angle in Joker gives the role a gritty freshness that is so capturing I didn't find myself making any comparisons, without offering spoilers Phoenix nailed it. The slow descent of the charecter in this origin film is dark, rough and most of all very sad and throughout it all you feel everything he feels. There is no 'super' in this supervillain's early story so what you're left with is a man that you can relate to, and that's what makes this so damn good.<br/><br/>It isn't often I asvise people that they 'must go' to the cinema, but if you haven't seen this yet then you really must go, it needs the big screen and sound. In 20 years this will be the film people are still fond of. "
4908," Wow!
"," After hearing about the new joker film, my immediate thought was, do we have room for another joker after Ledgers whopper of a performance in The dark knight? Well we most definitely do! Phoenix's commitment to the part was second to none! With a great background setting to his unstable upbringing, you can really get on board with the sense of sadness that surrounds his life! The switch up of showing the uprising of the 'baddy' and how he becomes the hero in taking on life's bullies that have tormented his dark and twisted mind, are a real thrill!
With great backing soundtracks and punchy 'off the cuff' one liners, this film is a hit!
I award it 9.1/10 "
4909," Don't miss it
"," This movie overturns the way we think about superhero movies. It's an anti-hero movie, but not in the same direction as the The Dark Knight in general. Joaquin phoenix's incredible performance, and amazing soundtrack. Even more striking is the film's remake of batman's growth history. It's worth a Golden Lion award. "
4910," Bestttttt!!
"," The movie ""JOKER"" is definitely The movie of the year for me.... Don't know about the Oscars, but it was once in the lifetime performance by Joaquin Phoenix....and would remain in my heart for years &amp; in my brain for days to come,,,may be.....The best portrayal of a psycho character that i have seen...was that of Christian Bale in 'American Psycho'.....Phoenix was right up there too if not above, not only the craziness, disturbance and madness but also the physical transformation was quite unspeakable.... "
4911," WOW
", Best movie. Call it acting or direction or cinematography or lighting anything. It's the perfect blend for everything. 
4912," BELIEVE THE HYPE
"," We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for Joker. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.<br/><br/>Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.<br/><br/>For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments. "
4913," Forget the oscars, they need to invent a new award for this!
"," Tragic, scary, grotesque. No movie will make you feel like joker does.
I sat in the theater in absolute awe of this masterpiece. It was more than a film, it was creation, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance was beyond acting.
The cinematography was amazing and the scores were unique and penetrating.
Such an amazing experience of strong mixed feelings that I will never forget!!!
I don't want to do the comparison with Heath ledger's joker because they are two different characters in two different movies. "
4914," Must watch
", Plz guys must watch movie.....dont see the negitive review...you will miss the movie of the century...

", Any bad review is bull this movie is an all time great I don't what there is to complain about.

4917," Masterpiece
"," It's one of the best, everything amazing ,the epic soundtrack , the acting , everything is perfect , it's an Oscar movie. "
4918," Depressing...
"," ,,,but an Oscar winner for JP no doubt. Its all been done before, the dark decline into depressive mental health caused by both internal and external sources, it just gets more recognition this time because its based on a comic book villain, brilliantly acted and produced and brilliantly filmed but there are no hero's in this film, just victims. It starts dark and it stays dark, its the story of how the Joker became the comic psychotic villain, the story is told very well, but don't expect Batman or anything magical to appear to brighten the story. I get the feeling its going to sweep up many awards "
4919," Unbelievable Jeff!
"," Oscar winning performance from Joaquin Phoenix, I would even go as far as saying he's challenging Heath Ledger for best Joker. Outstanding with a deep meaning to the movie. I would highly recommend. "
4920," Amazing
", This is one of the best films have ever made from a HQ. Todd Phillips teaches how to produce a film from heroes universe and to be deep. He entered on the mental issues that our generation suffer nowadays. 
4921," You wouldn't get it :)
"," That's life.<br/><br/>Ohhh that background score. Ohhhh that screenplay. Ohhhh those frames, each frame was a craft at best.
Ohhhh those dialogues. Ohhhh that Mr. Phoenix.<br/><br/>And that song.<br/><br/>A heavyweight contender for the best 10 of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I was sure that this kind of cinema was a thing of past. But I m glad I was wrong. "
4922," Masterpiece
"," One of the best movies i have ever seen, the development of the character is outstanding, his acting is amazing, the movie is so deep that it reaches to some feelings in you that you never thought you even have, it is depressing in a weird way, overall such and amazing actor, amazing script. Great movie. "
4923," HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
"," Arthur Fleck is a disturbed and deeply troubled individual who gets by in the big city as a clown and stand-up comedian. A series of tragic events rupture the core of his fragile mental state and his gradual descent into the abyss is as unsettling as it is assured. Joaquin Phoenix is fine as the demented lead and lends pathos and sympathy in this portrayal of madness. Lags in some parts, ugly and grimy film that makes the movie look like it was filmed forty years ago in a bad way and a dose of pc mar what should have been a more punchier flick. There's also a lack of oomph that's necessary to fully flesh out films like this. While no classic, ""Joker"" somewhat lingers long after the credits fade and it's a breath of fresh air in that a dark, creepy film is both an artistic and commercial success in a time of fantasy and cartoons glutting contemporary cinema. Push your fingers on both sides of your lips and smile that blood-flecked grin. "
4924," Like nothing else.
", Going for a 3rd view tomorrow....2hr film time flies by. Mesmerizing performance by phoenix. 
4925," Great movie......... But....
"," Absolutely great movie, the only fault I can see is the joker in this is more of a crazy simpleton rather than the a crazy super villain, capable of being the arch nemesis to batman for so long. "
4926," A cinematic masterpiece
", This movie is absolutely incredible. Ledger would be proud... 
4927," Good as standalone movie
"," The Joker is a cinematic masterpiece with a great performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It would have been one of the best movies if it wasn't about the joker, supposedly. Because as an origin movie for the Joker it is terribly inaccurate. The Joker is portrayed as an old idiot with mental health issues. While the DC Joker is a highly intelligent psychopath who can outsmart Batman on occasion. It is a fantastic movie, but not a good representation of the Joker. In my opinion Heath Ledgers, Mark Hamilton's and Jack Nicholson's Jokers are thousand times better. "
4928," Should be named ""Arthur""
"," I would give it a 9 if the movie was rightfully named ""Arthur"", and not ""Joker"". I don't see a connection between Arthur and Joker. "
4929," Not that great, but don't forget to smile :)
"," The plot is quite simple. It's centered around the main character who is in pain, never finds hope and then tipps into folly to escape this cruel world.
The structure of the movie resemble of the Hangover of the same Phillips : In the Hangover, the half-teen half-adults main characters are mired in their issue throughout the entire movie until the last minutes, and the it ends on a climax.
In the Joker, the main character (Arthur) will suffer throughout all movie, but he finishes on a climax.
If the movie shares similarities with the Hangover, it also shares the same weaknesses which are the lack of plot and character development.
The two doesn't really have a complex scenario, there's just a chain of events, things are revealed and everything get crazier and crazier.
Except for the main character, all the supporting ones are one-dimensional and all the rich guys are bad and evil to an unrealistic point (Traders and millionaire physically bullying people in the the train or in public toilets, yeah)<br/><br/>But enough with the bad criticism and let's talk about the good points :
First, cinematography is great. It's fair to say that it's the most realistic depiction of Gotham to date : colored people, call girls, trash everywhere etc.
Music is OK. There's some notes that are clearly taken from the Nolan's Batman but it's rather a nice tribute. I'd reproach that some tracks which are playing when Arthur is walking sound more like a warrior entrance and doesn't really fit the scene.
The main strength of the movie is Phoenix's performance. He truly stepped up for the role, has a large panel of emotions and is always convincing.
There's a bit of Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker when he has this warm amazed look on his face and we can only have genuine empathy for him (let us face it, his situation is more relatable than Bruce Wayne's).
Moreover, this depiction of Arthur shows a glimpse of the supervillain in him. Arthur is abused but never look weak : He has a very stable and intense gaze. Furthermore, he is very skinny but demonstrates tremendous strength at several times and has an impressive accuracy when he shoots at people (he never miss).
There's also an escalation of gratuity in his murders that announce his descent into darkness : At first, he kills the three traders for physically attacking him, then he kills his adoptive mother and his colleagues just because of their lies, and finally, he kills Franklin (the second parental figure he kills directly or indirectly, the third one being Thomas Wayne) just because he made fun of him.
Phoenix's Joker is a great character in its standalone movie that has been made to exists in its own universe. We can't really imagine him to become a criminal mastermind and battle Batman.
The movie deals with the enormous social inequalities and Joker is a product of this society.
His final murder in the movie turns him from a martyr to a ""hero"" among impoverished people because he dares to act against a powerful man and tips the balance by his crimes.
It also announces the real birth of Joker because it's done in public and on TV and the Joker lives through the eyes of his public.
Indeed, he only finds joy when he is playing on a scene (especially when people are clapping at him), when he is watching a movie and when he is dreaming awaken (his first scene with Murray Franklin, his relationship with his neighbour...). His happiness is closely linked to the show and the medias.
This movie has reminiscences of ""Taxi driver"" but there's also ""Network"" material in it. "
4930," a masterpiece - the Joker is real
"," From the first minute to the last, the Jo(a)ker catches you and keeps you entertained, tensed up and mesmerized. Joaquin Phoenix shows a one of a kind performance with a huge but easy to be missed character development on such a constant extreme ""crazy"" level, it just makes the resulting Joker frightening real. There may have been bad, good and grand Joker interpretations. This one is the real deal.
""if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice"" (comic quote) "
4931," Joaquin is ace ..but the third act/climax is disappointing
"," Joaquin is ace as JOKER, a mentally disturbed man severely let down by the system amd society that is supposed to care for him. The cinematography is stunning, especially on IMAX and De Nero is excellent as the talk show host. Because it's a low budget movie you don't get the big climax you usually expect from a DC movie but I guess you have to see JOKER as a standalone movie showing how JOKER became JOKER. "
4932," Everyone has it correct, which make this a 6/10
",
4933," The movie was great but...
"," Was this movie great? YES
Does it deserves all the praise that it's getting? Probably
My only complaint about it tho is that we already got better versions of this move (The King of Comedy and especially Taxi Driver) "
4934," Most overhyped movie of 2019
",
4935," This really is a must see
"," Easily the best film so far in 2019
An astonishing performance by Joachim Phoenix. The mood and flow of the film are perfect "
4936," Awesome performance
"," Saw it yesterday. Just want to say, this is truly one of the best acting work that I have seen in years. These days people only expects action explosions fight scenes, but truly Mr. Phoenix did a fantastic job being the Joker. To see the film tru the eyes of the Joker that someone who can not lose anything more stands up to make a point briljant! I hope Mr. Phoenix will get an Oscar Award for this he deserves it! "
4937," Gritty. Real. Original.
"," Little to no CGI.
Dark, true to the reality that would create a man such as the Joker.
Original material. Original shot creation. Still grabs you and let's you know this film exists in the Batman universe.
Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely masterful in every way, from beginning to end. "
4938," Good
"," Excellent tha film is so feeling depressed
But i like it
And the jocker is meya meya "
4939," This is the world we made.
"," Just watched joker.
DC always and this film is the complete reason why, DC has and always will be head and shoulders above marvel.
The greatest hero and villain ever were just MEN.
Blown away by the acting.
I put this portrait of the joker above the dark knight.
This film respects total absorption In regard to the fact that it's totally grounded and viable that this could really happen or has.
If like me you know your DC, Then forever use this film as the template to make sense of the WHY behind the greatest comic book villain EVER. "
4940," Example of Perfection
"," For sure movies like this couldn't be made by marvel
it will be remembered as a masterpiece. "
4941," SORRY HEATH... THERE'S A NEW JOKER IN TOWN
"," IT'S HARD NOT TO ACCEPT THE NEW KING OF JOKERS... NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT THE ENDING, BUT A WELL DONE FILM NONETHELESS. "
4942," Movie: okay one, acting: legendary. Phoenix kept the legacy unlike Leto.
"," Jack Nicolson, Heath Ledger and now Joaquin Phoenix, unlike Jared Leto, these actors have given us a Joker to remember. Movie itself isn't that great. Story isn't that great. It's the acting that saved the movie. "
4943," This will change ComicBook movies forever!
"," Just like how the dark knight changed comicbook movies for years to come this movie will be the next benchmark. I mean even if you remove the comicbook references this movie is a masterpiece. It's strange how the character Joker is so iconic, we have got 2 performances that just blew it out of the park and these portrayals are something no one can ever achieve.<br/><br/>I was only familiar of Joaquin from the movie Her. He was really good in that but I was still sketchy about this movie. The trailers came out and I spent all the time waiting for this movie by watch trailer reactions on youtube.<br/><br/>Hope DC does similar movies. Perhaps if todd can reprise as a director for another standalone movie. "
4944," Career Best Performance For Joaquin Phoenix
"," Having just seen ""Joker"" I'm going to call it.... Best Actor Oscar, Joaquin Phoenix.<br/><br/>""Joker"" was ASTOUNDING. One of the top five performances I have ever seen in my entire life. Joaquin as Arthur Fleck is, in turns, terrifying, heartbreaking, hilarious, yet somehow completely relatable at every turn. The performance of a lifetime. "
4945," Joker is No Joke
"," This movie is one of the best films I've seen in a while. It's an incredible character study of a psychopath, rejected and mocked by society until he finally snapes. This film truly questions the morality of everyone in the audience and presents a corrupt society that is frighteningly true of today's. The acting and direction of this movie is astonishing and I, for one, prey that this movie receives the Best Picture award at the upcoming 92nd Academy Awards. This is a movie that has something to say and leaves you thinking once it's finished. It's a true masterpiece that achieves more than doing justice to the greatest comic book villain of all time. Everyone who reads this review, I beg of you to see this movie. It's a phenomenal achievement that provides the audience with important questions about their treatment of their fellow man. "
4946," Superb acting!
"," Audio and video effects: 8 few scenes, but there are many vistas of the scene, the protagonist is delicate and close-up, the face emotions are obviously captured
Rhythm of the plot: 7 The overall slow spread, for the climax of the back, the mood is too strong, does not clearly express the wisdom of the clown character, but the charm is full, there is no gorgeous scene with the stage name, but the small person gesture is close to the audience, the bloody darkness is not brought to the individual Gotham City level.
Actor acting: 9.5 distinctive dance twists and strange and uncomfortable laughter, with the undulating performances of various stages of the plot, the multi-scene exposed thin and thin body contrasts with increasing pressure, the action of painting the clown makeup many times is considered The plot is high, but the hard part is that there is no makeup to interpret the increasingly distorted situation. "
4947," Dark Psychological Approach
"," I saw ""Joker"", starring Joaquin Phoenix-Walk the Line, Gladiator; Robert De Niro-The Comedian, The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle; Brett Cullen-The Shallows, The Dark Knight Rises and Zazie Beetz-Deadpool 2, Atlanta_tv.
This is the first in the DC comics new line called DC Black Label. They will be stand alone movies not connected to the regular DC universe of movies. Joaquin plays Joker in this dark psychological approach to his origin story. You see his descent into madness and the violence here-although not a lot of it-is sudden and very graphic. Joaquin works as a clown while developing his joke telling abilities as a stand up comedian-he performs at clubs whenever possible. Robert plays a talk show host-think Johnny Carson-that gets a video of Joaquin's act and invites him on his show. Brett plays a man running for mayor that wants to clean up Gotham City-they have been having problems with people becoming vigilantes that are taking the law into their own hands and even killing people. Zazie plays Joaquin's neighbor that he has a crush on. There are times that you are not sure if a scene is really happening or if Joaquin is imagining it in his deep psychosis. As to the question of whether or not Batman makes an appearance or not; Yes &amp; No. Bruce Wayne shows up, but not in costume.
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 1 minute.
I enjoyed this different look at a familiar character and would buy it on DVD. "
4948," Why 10 stars ?
"," Cause u' ll ovastand that only the day after, I didn't see it in Imax, I'll going tomorrow... Phoenix?... Oscar, he missed it in The Gladiator, and he made an amazing performance. I really he Will get it this year cause he really deserve it. We love him. Tsm bro, big pleasure went at cinema the first day. U' ll never forget the first time lol "

"
4954," Joker
",
4955," Set the hook as a comic book movie, and real in the suckers.
"," So I really didn't enjoy the Joker movie and definitely can understand the people being upset. In my opinion it sucks people in thinking they'll see a comic book type movie, just as a marketing ploy and then leans heavily on trying to randomly include source material via namedropping ""Wayne"" . Then it's similar to the Movie Taxi Driver (made with Denerio) about a guy that goes crazy and kills people and is then celebrated for it and glorifies violence as ""deserving it and embraced by people who understand and condone murder"" not even entertaining in that just wallowes in self pity and shifting of blame for actions. If you want to make a movie like that, it can be done and done well obviously since it's taken from another movie. But don't try and use connections to comic books to increase the crowd draw and then expect people to be ok with it. Saying its societies fault when someone who deserves to be institutionalized and would be in real life and that society condones murder and it's not the killers fault is tone deaf in this day and age. Plots progression is unbelievable acting is great for sure. "
4956," Excellent acting but..........
"," Pheonix nailed his part but the story could have been better explored by not making it just a character study, i believe no one left the theater with an intention to rewatch it because it was slow and predictable. "

4959," Not bad

Cinematography 10
Acting 9
Others 5.5 "
4960," Not the Joker we wanted... But the Joker we deserved!
"," As a HUGE Nolan trilogy fan I went into this with low expectations. I mean, who could compare with Ledgers Joker portrayal, let alone compete with the great script and plot 'The Dark Knight' gave us?<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie completely blew me away. Not only was this great entertainment, but I left the cinema genuinely moved. Joaquin Phoenix will win the Oscar this year- no doubts.<br/><br/>This is not the origin story of any joker you have seen before. This is a very different take, and dare I say more realistic dissection of a villain we have all loved and hated for over a decade. I would love to see a sequel but a) I don't know how it would work and b) would be so scared they tarnished this work of art.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, buy a ticket now and go. You will NOT be disappointed. "
4961," Beautiful!
"," It's mind-blowing to see how far cinema has changed it's portrayal of mentally ill individuals.
A dark, beautifully macabre film that always leaves you guessing.
There's a lot to unpack but I highly recommend this film, it's something you have to sit down a focus on, but it's incredibly thought provoking "
4962," A masterpiece
"," It's astounding that something so closely resembling a piece of art, doesn't do so at the expense of being entertaining, edge of your seat cinema. There are millions of things for movie buffs and cinephiles alike to drool about and for your everyday movie goer, you'll be enraptured from start to finish.
This was a generation defining film. It was as close to perfect as a film can be. "
4963," A mirror to the establishment...
"," I really want to summarise how potent, pertinent and disturbingly beautiful a film like 'JOKER' is in the way it points an uncomfortable mirror back at society, in the way all powerful works of art do... except today in an age of the politically correct gag culture of low brow cinema and the ever growing dissent against the corruption of powerful elites in politics and the media, this is more than just a refreshing and timely story, but a revolutionary act and a warning to us all, surprisingly from a mainstream film no less. Don't listen to the shill ""critics"", 'Joker' is a modern masterpiece that is currently embarrassing it's detractors!! "
4964," Joaquin was PHENOMENAL! I have one criticism though...
"," My only criticism of the movie, and the reason I'm giving it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I was hoping that the focus would've been split more evenly between Arthur's descent into madness and him actually being the Joker in the costume and makeup. The last 30 minutes of the movie was AMAZING when he actually looked the part of Joker and was sauntering and dancing around the city causing havoc, and the way it ended left me wanting WAY MORE of him that way! It was so intriguing how the costume and makeup instantly transformed him into a villain, and I really don't think we got enough of that. It felt more like scratching the surface, to be honest... I doubt the director would do a sequel because he hasn't expressed any interest in interviews I've seen, so I'm not holding my breath for that. Ugh.. so disappointing!<br/><br/>Having said that, Joaquin was absolutely brilliant! He made me very uncomfortable a handful of times throughout those 2 hours and he did this character that we're all familiar with the best kind of justice (after Heath Ledger, of course). I don't think anyone can or will ever beat Heath's version of the Joker, but Joaquin came pretty damn close to his level and has definitely set a new precedent!<br/><br/>I really truly feel that he deserves to win the Oscar in February. He's been nominated for 3 Oscars in his career and it's about time he wins. A win for this role would make up for his other losses, the biggest one being playing Johnny Cash in Walk the Line. That was honestly one of the worst snubs in Oscar history!<br/><br/>I'll have my fingers crossed for him this time around :) "
4965," Excellent
", Complete masterpeice and highly entertaining as long as it lasted. Would reccomend. 
4966," ''Joker (2019) Review
"," ''Joker (2019)
Review<br/><br/>Walking out of Joker I knew I had seen a well-crafted film, but was unsure of my feelings regarding the direction the film had taken. I was surprised to find out that Todd Philips and his collaborator Scott Silver had written a film far more concerned with studying the titular character as an ordinary man troubled by mental illness than any previous cinematic incarnation up to that point. The decision to make the film a character driven study of the iconic character offers viewers a welcome fresh perspective.
From the opening scenes, the film establishes Gotham as an oppressively bleak, grimy city, nosily chugging along despite itself. The way Todd Philips and Cinematographer Lawrence Sher film the city evokes the many rat-infested alleyways of late 70's crime films; an era from which the film derives quite a lot of inspiration. In many ways, Gotham's depiction also reminded me of the City from Se7en. Both are dauntingly bleak and offer no glimpse of sunshine amongst their vast skylines. Had I not been reminded of the fact that the city on display was Gotham, I would have been completely content with the setting being a timeless unnamed metropolitan. While maybe a fitting setting for a cautionary tale tackling universal themes, the way Todd Phillips weaves comic book mythology so seamlessly with his distinct vision makes for some of the most captivating aspects of Joker.
While the city may be a character in and of itself, it plays a supporting role to Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck. His performance allows the viewers to simultaneously sympathize with the character's struggles as well as dread his eventual transformation. While I found certain aspects of the social commentary direct and underdeveloped, much like the mob of protestors swarming the police vehicle, it ultimately acts as a stage for the character's transformation and into the titular villain. "
4967," best movie
"," Acting was best and mad i loved it really great. ""Joker"" centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen. Phillips' exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham's fracturedsociety. A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night...but finds the joke always seems to be on him. Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study. "

But brilliantly, exquisitely played by Joaquin Phoenix. "

"," The entire movie is unironically a bruh moment. 9/10 movie. It's a perfect movie there's no issue's I saw. but I will never give a movie 10/10 'yeah I'm really pretentious' .but to compare this movie with the dark knight is almost impossible I mean the joker has better character development but the dark knight has a better story structure. And nobody should compare Joaquin's performance to health ledgers performance because they are so different I mean seriously they have to no similarities except having the joker name. This movie exceeded my expectations and I already had unrealistic expectations this is the only movies that has delivered more than I thought it would even though I thought it was gonna be good. This movie is not for everyone just like all movies thats why I never give movies a 10/10 I always try to be objective in my movie reviews. But in my heart it's a 10/10 This is my second favorite movie of all time. And if this doesn't win best picture and best performance then it really proves how the Oscars, some critics, and the main stream media are so unreliable and biased "

"," An extremely important message of the movie highlights the importance of kindness and listening to others.
This basic message seems to have escaped a lot of people who otherwise seem to be into the movie just for the ""kewl"" factor. Some even seem to have ironically twisted the meaning into some kind of anti-left sentiment and bashing critics. Smarter people know better.<br/><br/>I guess good people will take a good message from the movie and bad people, well, bad.<br/><br/>I personally thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Joaquin Phoenix's acting was awesome. There's more to the movie than violence. It touches on important issues such as kindness, poverty, mental illness, injustice etc. "
4975," Briliant portrayal of the joker
"," I thought it was going to be trash but boy are metacritic and rotten tomatoes wrong, this movie is a grade A . Its everything id want in a joker movie and an interesting take on the infamous sociopath clown. If you don't believe me , go watch it yourself ... ignore these false critics, they need to be unemployed because clearly they do not know what a masterpiece is. "
4976," Please give that man an Oscar
"," I honestly wasn't looking forward to a Joker origins movie - I've always liked the idea of him having no real backstory. Having Phoenix play the part caught my interest though and I must say I was deeply impressed with his performance. He's sad and menacing at the same time and the way he slowly spirals out of control reminded me mostly of 'Requiem for a Dream' (but with clowns). This film is an absolute masterpiece and provides an alternative for you average Marvel/DC superhero movie. Now don't get me wrong, I love those as well - the difference is that in a few years time, I will still want to rewatch Joker, while having forgotten all about the Ant-mans of this world... "

", A solid movie. Something really worth watching. I just re-visited it. And I really enjoyed my time with it again. It's hard these days to find classics like this. But this one certainly does it. 
4979," Joker
"," Throughout my conversations, I believe that those who walked away from the film thinking the movie was about the Joker missed the point - and largely left unsatisfied. In my mind, this was one of the most brutal and unforgiving depictions of desperation and utter loneliness, and how society can alter or advance this emotional desperateness. With that mindset, I believe Joker to be a masterpiece. 10/10 "
4980," Masterpiece of a broken soul.
"," Joker is the story of a broken person. A modern day masterpiece in its own write. Without a doubt Joaquin Phoenixs' performance is the main highlight of the film. this film was not at all possible without his brilliant performance. The darkness, the brutality, the poetic justice of this calamatic humanism, it's all part of this film. And obviously i have to say it's a brilliantly written film. According to my opinion as of now, This is the best Origin story of any comic character (Hero/Anti hero, DC/Marvel). This Joker is undoubtedly the masterpiece of DC universe. "
4981," Slow...... but worth!!!!
"," First half is a bit slow to build the story and character ..........
joaquin phoenix lived as joker!!! "
4982," The Joker
"," The film is amazing, the best movie of the year. Like says a user more down, the hype is real!. Joaquin Phoenix make the movie even better. "
4983," Masterpiece
"," Amazing as expected! They better give Joaquin Phoenix his Oscar that he deserves, he is the best actor out there! "
4984," AMAZING !
", OSCAR FOR Joaquin 100%! I went into this skeptically! This movie was so disturbing. Just the way it was supposed to be! So amazingly good! This is how Joker comes to be! RIP Heath Ledger. This is absolutely AMAZING! 
4985," Wowzers.
"," From start to finish it felt like being on a rollercoaster with the adrenaline rush I got from this film. This is proper ""Joker"" for me. Phoenix was outstanding, you could see the pain in his eyes. "

"," I was totally blown away by the acting, story, cinematography, directing, tone...well everything. Gonna watch a million times. "
4987," 11/10
", This film is simply breathtaking. Character development is best I've seen. Whether you are a comic book fan or not you will walk away from this movie in awe. 
4988," Came out of the cinema BOUNCING!
"," Wow, I can't think of another film that ever had this impact on me! I've never managed to watch a batman film to the end and only watched this because 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' had stopped showing. Had fairly low expectations, knew it would be better than the usual comic book film but had no idea just how amazing it would be. I have never seen a performance like it, pure genius from beginning to end. There is barely a moment in the film when the focus isn't totally on the Joker and he totally captivates you. You FEEL his pain...intensely!<br/><br/>Every tiny detail was perfect, what story writing, what acting, what set design, what an amazing sound track, a masterpiece from beginning to end...I'm off to see it again! (first film review I've ever felt compelled to write). "
4989," At last...
"," Finally the Joker character is given the start he deserves. Dark, gritty and not reliant on an army of people working on graphics to complete. The only weak moments for me (which is why IMO the movie is not a 10/10) were the segments with Bruce Wayne. They didn't quite work for me and didn't seem believable at all in the context of the movie. "
4990," Disturbing Character Study
", Disturbing character study disguised as a comic book origin story holds its audience captive by grounding Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance in an authentically gritty world; could serve as a great first act in a larger narrative. 
4991," You have to watch, but alone,
"," A lot of different feelings when you see it. Specially with a background of someone who is living in Gotham city .. I mean really living in city the same as Gotham city and lives with people who are turning to be Jokers with the time.
I like it, however it is different from my criteria for movies I like as I like movies with positive energy for real people which can give me a push to move it. This one is for people who needs a push to push bad things around them but this needs courage that I don't think the people of Gotham city don't have it yet, that is why you will go out in a bad mode, not because you didn't like the movie, but because you keep asking yourself when I will set myself free of fears.
I was watching it in Kuwait. Surrounded with a wealthy people (young and old). Noticing there reactions was another experience. This is something needs another post.
In short, watch it, as you will miss a lot. "
4992," Don't trust the critics!
"," This movie is an absolute masterpiece. A descend of a man into craziness and becoming the CLOWN prince of crime.<br/><br/>There are several things great about this film,
I'll list them.<br/><br/>1. ACTING
Whoaa! One of the greatest acting performances you'll ever see. Joaquin phoenix should win Oscar for best acting. The laughing scenes are great and makes you feel sad for Arthur fleck, however when he becomes joker that sympathy is no more there. You won't feel bad for him in the second half.<br/><br/>2.STORY
Arthur fleck works as a clown. He tries to become a stand up comedian. But he has a neurological disorder which makes him laugh uncontrollably. He kills three guys in subway for self defence. He learns he is an illigimate son of billionaire Thomas Wayne. But nope, his mother adopted him and let her boyfriend abuse him. He learns this and smothers his mom. And he becomes transforms totally into joker. This story is DARK, VIOLENT. So great. I love it.<br/><br/>3. CINEMATOGRAPHY<br/><br/>Every shot in this movie is a beautifully crafted art.
This movie should win the academy award for best cinematography next year. Every scene feels iconic.
It feels great to watch every scene. Because it's beautifully crafted art as I mentioned before.<br/><br/>4. SCORE<br/><br/>The music in this film makes you feel frightening, it's so intense and great. It is so emotional and it completes this film.<br/><br/>5. DIRECTING AND SCREENPLAY<br/><br/>Thank Todd Philips for giving us this masterpiece.
It's so well crafted thanks to the direction of Todd. And the screenplay should win academy award for best director and best adapted screenplay.<br/><br/>That's not it. I can't list everything. If I forget something great I'm sorry. I love this movie that's why I gave it 10 out of 10. This movie is capable of winning multiple Oscars. Please, Don't trust the critics. Please watch it and you'll never regret it. "

4996," Standing ovation!!!
"," This was the first time that I witness an audience giving applause at the end of a movie in cinema. I can tell you it was totally worth it - every piece and every second of it. I was left haunted after the first screening, so I went for an another today and it was the same like the first, full of joy and excitement, seeing Arthur transforming into Joker.... Joaquin blew our mind, the audience was enjoying as if it were live screening. If his Majesty Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar, I can say and please allow me to quote Roberto Benigni from ""La tigre e la neve"" - they can close this whole show of a world... they can cart it off, unscrew the stars, roll up the sky and put it on a truck, they can turn off this sunlight..... Hats off! "
4997," Tour de Force - Joaquin 's Best and Worthy of ""A Best Actor"" Oscar and Best Film

Just a gripping tale of a guy going over the edge - much like Taxi Driver.and taking others with him. Lead character is expertly done by Joaquin Phoenix and the script is finely honed to make you pay rapt attention. You liked Taxi Driver? you'll love Joker. An absolute MUST SEE! "

"

For me a 10, another may rate as a -10. Only you can be the judge. "

"," The movie is extremely dark and dramatic. You can feel the hard and difficult emotions seeping through. It tells a story, that lots of people can relate just maybe in the different spectrum. You could say everyone one of us has a bit of Joker insider our self's. Society, the pressure of acting normal and following the rules sometimes takes the joy of the life. But at least most of times it's OK enough. Sadly not so much for the soon to become Joker, his life was really tough one. And we get to see all the emotional troubles he is caring with him.<br/><br/>The move is exceptional. Instant classic, this the best Joker performances ever. Everyone should see it! "

Pheonix plays an almost accidental tourist on his way to becoming the joker.
No delusions of granduer or thoughts of world domination, just a slow, jerking and painful stripping away of humanity.
systemic apathy towards mental health and the ignorance of the state are all contributing factors in molding of arthur, resulting in a rather stunned awakening as the joker.
Cannot recommend this movie enough "

", The start of something spectacular! Very excited to see what comes after this amazing film so well done. 
5018," Absolutely stunning
", Joaquin's performance is overwelming. A cascade of emotions and a great end. We want more of this Joker! 
5019," Simply Awesome..
"," First of all the most attractive thing in this film is the Acting.. such a brilliant acting by Joaquin Phoenix.
The next best thing is the story. Really, this film is just like a biopic of Joker but the story is really awesome.
Next thing is its Screenplay. Such a beautiful presentation.
I really liked this movie. According me this is one of the best movie from DC universe. "
5020," SPOILER AHEAD: A couple of questions only for those who have seen the film
"," So, I won't comment on the film itself, or Phoenix's stunning performance.I already rated a 10/10 which I rarely do.
The question is: Is really Joker Batman's half brother after all?
At first I thought, no, it is clearly stated that he was adopted. Then my girlfriend reminded me that his mother had said that Thomas Wayne had given her: ""some papers to sign"".
What were those papers? Were they the adoption papers? Why were they handed to her by Wayne? Why would he bother about a half crazy employee of his?
Most Importantly: How the hell did a single, mentally disturbed woman come to adopt a child? This can only be done if a person of influence, namely Thomas Wayne, pulls the right strings.
The second question is: Did he kill his fictional girlfriend?
It seems to me that although it's not shown directly, it is implied when he leaves her appartment and walks the corridor.
This would make sense if we link this killing with that of his mothers. They are the two people with whom he still has a bond (a real one regarding the mother, a fictional one, yet very strong, regarding the ""girlfriend"" ). That bond -loving, or being in love with- somebody else, is the one that still keeps the last remnants of humanity in him. Once this bond is cut, the minute he completes the two murders, he is not a human being anymore, even in his own conciousness. It is the time that the transformation into a monster is complete. He has become ""The Joker"".
So what do you think? "
5021," One of the Best movie I've ever watched !
"," Dark. Truth about society. That media doesn't want you to know.
Will hit you somewhere deep inside, the side which you have chosen not to reveal anybody. "
5022," Joker or how I learned to stop worrying and love the movie (2019)
"," I rarely write any reviews but I couldn't stop myself this time. The movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. Acting, music, cinematography, directing, dialogue - everything was on point. Yes, it's not your typical action packed comic book movie and I'm thankful for that. I think this movie is more suitable for a mature audience and not because of the bloodshed or the strong language but because of the topics and messages that are conveyed through it. I see how a hardcore comic book fan of the Joker may not like this movie as it derives from the original material at times. For me though, it was a breath of fresh air! "
5023," So good
", Amazing. Joaquin was amazing. Gonna win an Oscar for sure 
5024," A very deeping movie.
"," Joker"" is a 2019 film directed by Todd Phillips.
It is nothing but a message in favor of suffering people, forgotten and marginalized by the rest of society.
Today many people are just a mass of suppressants, selfish, cruel and exploiters towards the weakest needy. The reason why an individual behaves in a certain way does not matter. Only what others have seen count, I learned from third parties without making sure or investigating why he did it.
I hope the world changes.
May everyone realize that we are human beings who tend to do good but unfortunately we should move away from suppressors or those who represent antisocials. I hope everyone can realize how much we can do our best for ourselves and for the welfare of others. And that before judging a sick person, let everyone look inside their soul. "
5025," My Review of Joker
"," MASTERPIECE!<br/><br/>There is only one word to describe this film, and its Masterpiece. This film does so meny things to make you wonder if anything is even real and Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this movie deserves to win every Oscar. Along with that, Joker's laughter feels so real that it makes you feel uncontrollable at some parts. But I would not recommend this movie to children under 16 as there a lot of violence and adult content within this movie. However I would recommend this movie to everyone who is 16 and above! "
5026," Enjoyable
", Very enjoyable and Todd Phillips does an amazing job directing and setting the mood. 
5027," Great intense movie!
"," This is certainly not your average entertaining movie but very intense. Overall, after thinking more about it, I actually like it more than directly after watching it. It makes you think about different angles and really warrants the positive reviews. I do not really understand the negative ones, especially related that it would shed positive light on violence. I never felt that Joker's action were justified, to some extent I only felt sorry for him but that was about it. "
5028," Excellent movie
"," Really enjoyed the movie, strongly recommended
Reflection of reality in many communities "
5029," Joaquin Phoenix only
"," I have been waiting to watch this for so long , i decided to wait my friend and go with him , I hated Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator , loved him in Walk the line and became a huge fan in Her , so i love seeing him acting ,he is brilliant , so when i saw the announcement about this movie long time ago i could not wait , today i went with my friend and he did not disappointed me at all , I cried , felt his pain and laughed , he did worked hard in this character , I loved the music, DeNiro , however i'm very disappointed because of the end , this is not a complete story , the end is horrible to be honest , however i did not regret and i gave it 8 because of Joaquin Phoenix only , seeing you worth my time. "
5030," Joker (2019)
", This was one crazy movie but I loved it! It was good from start to finish and always had you on the edge of your seat. It really shows how Psychological disorders can develop overtime. Recommend seeing 100% 
5031," has some highs and lows
", Overall it is worth a watch. personally thought it was a cool take and style of movie. found it a little slow at times but overall enjoyed it; the darker the better for me lol. 
5032," fantastic
", Feel good and bad in laugh. you must go into the movie 
5033," Joker as you've never seen him before.
", Joaquin Phoenix at his pinnacle.. Never have I seen such a performance from a somehow underrated actor.. Not anymore I guess. The way he portrayed Joker is unreal. One would say that Joaquin was acting himself. The story was good. There were moments where you didn't know what to feel.. Certainly kept me on the edge of my seat at times and confused at other. I believe this is the only proper way of telling Joker's life. A solid 8 from me and a must watch for sure. 
5034," Metaphor for the decline and violence of Western Democracies
"," I wasn't prepared for this movie to make such a bold political statement. The Joker/ Arthur is a metaphor for the illness of western society and the failure of western democracy to care for its citizens.
The real Joke is we do not vote for leaders who care for citizens but try to live vicariously through images in media.
The film even has a go at the illusion in the happiness trap. Mans pursuit of happiness leaves In His wake another persons misery.
I guess the message is that the violent society is the one that allows obscene wealth to live alongside abject poverty. "
5035," The best recent film I've seen in 10 years
"," Before I begin my review, I want to say screw the media for slandering this film as if it'll cause mass shootings. It's rated R, so it's expected to have some adult content like blood and violence. The Joker is NOT A KID FRIENDLY VILLIAN. A lot of people lost sight of how evil and interesting the Joker can possibly be whether it's him paralyzing Batgirl and making Commisioner Gordon watch his daughter naked and bleeding to physically abusing Harley to carving off his own face no real reason. The movie has perfectly captured the Joker the best way it can. We see a struggling mentally ill man with hopes and dreams of being the greatest comedian ever to becoming a monster that the people of Gotham created. Joaquin Phoenix has done a phenomenal job of being ""Arthur"". The reason why I put quotations under his name because in the movie, the adoption papers has named him under ""Unknown"". I love the world that the movie has established as a rundown slum that ""Arthur"" is trapped in and you feel as if in that bad part of town that you want to escape from. All of the characters are great except I'm not so convinced about Bruce especially when his parents was killed in front of him. He showed no emotions of grief and anger. He just stood there. There are many ways to interpret what happened in the movie. Whether it all actually happened, some parts of the story were fake and exaggerated, or the entire story was all made up by The Joker who was trying to paint himself as a victim. I prefer the latter. Overall, I love everything in the film like the story, acting, editing, settings, soundtrack,and characters. It's good enough to be it's own movie that has nothing to do with DC. I hope they'll do a follow up film in the future. "
5036," JOKER a dark bleak origin story with lots of 70s references
"," JOKER<br/><br/>When Martin Scorsese's name got linked as a producer on this DC Comics spin-off movie, many people were flabbergasted. Scorsese? A Superhero flick?* In retrospect, once one sees the end result it makes a certain amount of sense. Much of JOKER plays like an alternate universe conglomeration of TAXI DRIVER and KING OF COMEDY (with healthy doses of MEAN STREETS and AFTER HOURS in the stew). Director and Co-Writer Todd Phillips and his partner Scott Silver cleverly weave in the origin story of the super-villain into this alternate reality.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a sad sack with psychological issues. So, of course, he's working as a for hire clown who spreads his anti-joy to those unfortunate to witness his services. Fleck lives with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). Fleck has dreams of becoming a stand up comedian, and , after a particularly awkward trial set, he ends up as a guest on a late night talk show hosted by none other than -- Rupert Pupkin himself, Robert DeNiro (as Murray Franklin). Also lurking around Fleck's purvueis a certain rich millionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and his son, uh, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson).<br/><br/>At this point it must be stressed that JOKER's screenplay and direction use the form of the (highly) unreliable narrator in telling its tale. Sometimes, the deception is clear. At other times, not so much, to the point where one can't be certain. For the most part, it's a smart strategy. The movie succeeds in keeping the viewer off-balance even if one is fairly certain where its ultimately headed.<br/><br/>Phoenix has long been one of cinema's most quirky and unusual leading men. As if to prove his bona fides as an eccentric, he even once pulled a year long stunt where he 'quit' acting to become a full-time rapper. Here his unpredictability is keenly used to the movie's advantage. Phoenix contorts and bends his body, and curls his facial muscles almost as if it were against his will. It's a physical transformation so complete, that the Joker clown makeup is almost superfluous.<br/><br/>JOKER exerts it grungy attitude in an effective manner for the first two acts. It's a dark bleak vision where the DC origins are almost unnecessary. The streets are crime ridden and literally filled with piles of garbage. Other than the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, it genuinely feels apart from the superhero machine. Unfortunately, Phillips and Silver have to not only shoe-horn in the comic book elements, but, in doing so they also become too confidant of their ability to give the movie false gravitas. Not content with paying homage to the Scorsese quartet, JOKER also weaves in DEATH WISH, and ultimately NETWORK (and not to the present movie's advantage). It feels force and Fleck/Joker's words begin to feel false and over-written (V FOR VENDETTA achieved similar conclusions much more smoothly and organically). The too on the nose song score also gets to be a bit much.<br/><br/>Despite the weak third act, JOKER is still a movie to be reckoned with. Missteps aside, it a jarring addition to mainstream blockbuster movie-making. Even if one isn't as seeped in the films of the 70s and early 80s** it's a daunting vision even it can't fully pull it off.<br/><br/><br/><br/>* In the end, it didn't happen, of course. The current 'official story' is that Scorsese was approached because the movie was to be set in NYC and it was thought his connections and production savvy could smooth the way for an easier shoot. He demurred in the end.<br/><br/>** Along with the titles mentioned, JOKER evokes such 70s crime films as THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1,2,3 and THE FRENCH CONNECTION. That's why it's a bit of surprise when it's revealed that it actually seems to take place in 1981 (references to the films WOLFEN and ZORRO THE GAY BLADE set the date). "
5037," Not Your Typical Superhero/Super-Villian Movie
"," Joaquin Phoenix presents a dark, deep study of a man who is battling mental illness and suffocating depression. His portrayal elevates him to the top of the Oscar race and finally establishes him as one of the best male leads in the movie industry. His performance harkens back to his role in the obscure indy film ""Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot."" His role in ""The Joker"" is a study in madness you won't soon forget.<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes of the film is absolutely gripping. The final 30 minutes delves into a zombie apocalypse that distracts from the personal focus of the film. However, there is a school of thought that the entire closing sequence was merely a fantasy in the Joker's disturbed mind.<br/><br/>Much of the violence is suggested in the film; this is not all about blood and gore, though it does contain graphic, shocking scenes. Movie fans of shoot-'em-up, CGI Superhero films will be caught off guard by this biopic-epic.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro's supporting role as a talk show host is refreshing and a welcome relief from his endless stream of buddy films that has made people forget that he was once in the conversation as the best actor of his generation.<br/><br/>A must see for movie goers who desire some adult drama instead of viewing yet another regurgitated comic book flick. "
5038," Incredible profile of mental illness
"," Phoenix is brilliant here. This was an incredible insight in to the spiral of mental illness. Easily the best captured in dramatic cinema. The film is ""dark"" on a level that you rarely experience in a movie, but remained entirely absorbing and fascinating. If you're looking for a Marvel or DC movie experience here, you can keep moving. This elevates the genre in the same way the Nolan did with the Dark Knight more than a decade ago. "
5039," PHOENIX EMBODIED THIS ROLE
"," I went in knowing that it made a lot of headlines and controversy, but it was absolutely amazing. a true masterpiece. this is the best joker characterization i've ever seen, it literally goes full circle. it starts off a little slow maybe but then a huge twist and WOW factor and the rest of the movie is basically mind blowing.
i'd see it again soon! "
5040," Stands alone as a smart psychological thriller
",
5041," Difficult and Brilliant
"," This was not entertainment. I sat on the recliner chair and I must say that within 10 minutes my back was upright and my eyes fixed on the screen. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker was difficult to watch but at the same time enthralling beautiful.
The film gradually built the character up as an Origin movie should. I just hope, that this Joker becomes part of the DC Universe, as to see what he becomes after this would grant ""closure"" in some ways. "
5042," Different in a good light
"," Joker has been one of the most anticipated and hype movies of the year and the hype began when Joaquin Phoenix was cast as Joker. The hype for the film is accurate as this is a great and entertaining film. This isn't a typical ""superhero"" film but more of a crime drama, based upon the origin story.<br/><br/>The acting by Joaquin was top notch as expected and will sure give him plenty of award season nominations. The supporting cast is great as well. What makes this film as good as it is, is not only the performances but the writing and story is interesting. This is a far different Joker than in the previous Batman films. Also a really good thing the studios didn't tone this movie down, as it's R-rating most definitely have it more of a realistic edge, than a PG-13 rating would. "
5043," Unbelievable. Seriously!
",
5044," Finally a good movie.
"," This was a fully realized movie with a script that made sense and excellent compliments - including good acting, soundtracks, and cinamatography. I was interested for the entire time. It has been so long since a ""good"" movie was actually made. It is also hints that the entire movie might not be happening and thus you can walk out of the movie not even knowing if it was meant to be anything real..so you are going to be thinking about this one for a while. "
5045," ""In a world of over saturated 'funny' comic book movies, the only serious one is about a clown.""
",
5046," I love this film
"," The joker for me is the best villain from any superhero film, comic or franchise. He's the most believable. He hasn't got any powers, endless amounts of money, specialist equipment or high end training. He's just a bloke with some serious issues.
I am and always will be a massive lover of Heath Ledgers joker, he revolutionised the character. A true villain!
Joaquin Phoenix hasn't copied Heaths portrayal, but the elements are there. He did what Heath did which was notice the opportunity of playing an iconic character and absolutely smashed it. The beauty of the joker is if you play him right it's immediately recognised and celebrated. Obviously part of this is down to the writing and directing. But you can't fault the acting. Suicide squad got it wrong. And this was perfect.
Will Phoenix win an Oscar? I'm not sure but he should be at least be nominated. "
5047," Dark, Fun, confusing and painful
"," Good movie. Can't say more really. It's a good movie. Great acting, good screen play, good Directing and good timing. I had a good time watching this movie. After watching i both understand why some call it problematic and some call it a masterpiece.
I liked the movie mostly because fenix performance. He is the best Joker alive, no question asked. I think Directing was a bit to much influenced by Taxi driver, but it was professional nonetheless.
At this climate we need a movie like this, not because of its massage or anything like that, but we need something to be scary to push the boundaries and try to cross the red lines and censorship in the nowadays society.
In my opinion it's a movie, nothing more and nothing less. Watch it, think about it and move on. "
5048," Superb role in method acting and great shots!
", This is a great film. Disturbing and shocking like I haven't seen in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix excels. He deserves an Oscar for this is not another Batman movie but a masterpiece. Please be aware and dont bring your kids. It is not for teens nor children!!!

"," Joker is a confusing movie about whole Batman universe. I did not find out when did Batman meet with Joker. According to movie Joker appeared just before Thomas Wayne's death and at that time Bruce Wane was a kid. After that he arrested and we don't know when did it happen? So, Joker is completely different from all Batman movies. "
5052," Absolutely insane through and through
"," Wow just wow. Spiral into madness or happiness? Smile through the pain or does the pain make you smile?
Brilliance of Joker. "
5053," BRILLIANT
"," Brilliant, simply brilliant. Pheonix is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale year of acting. The movie is slow paced, working on the progression into madness by a man who has been subjected to negative experience after negative experience with a climax that is both satisfying yet questions both the audiences empathy/sympathy towards the joker 10/10 "
5054," A true, gritty, dark, psychological and cinematic masterpiece.
"," This movie certainly is of a unique style. Director Tod Phillips delivers an oscar worthy masterpiece that everyone who really loves cinema should watch and study....
Crime, darkness, thriller, madness and dark humor this film has it all. I personally feel that these type of films should be films to look up to and learn from. . .not turn down....it's really sad when critics without film sense review this type of a film and shun it.....""You Gus should tell the audience how good it is from their pov and not from yours.""....Haters gonna hate. JOKER is true gold. "
5055," Joaquin Conquers All.
"," Just been to see the movie tonight, It met all my expectations and then some, Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely mesmerising in this role. The casting is brilliant, the soundtrack is brilliant, the cinematography is outstanding and this all leads to a gritty, dark, realization from Todd Philips. Absolutely sublime work and will stand up against most if not all movies over the last few decades. "

5063," Joker is here to stay
", Went to watch it for the second time cause I felt I missed out on alot of things when I saw it for the first time. And I could relate to Arthur not everybody is privileged he moved me. The dancing scene on the stairs probably for me is one of the greatest scene in cinematic history. I will always remember that scene. What makes that scene special is For a character like Arthur to break out from his shackles and dance they way he did with all the swag man I can't put it to words 
5064," Deep , Dark & Daring
"," Terrific performance by Joaquin , Some might find it boring but people should know what they are in for , it's a character study of the most iconic DC villain and a fantastic one . "
5065," Excellent
"," I was gripped throughout this movie. I like psychological storytelling that makes you think a bit more. I felt the director delivered on this movie with the script, score and acting. Phoenix is captivating and not always in a good way. I experienced a rollercoaster of emotions. Sadness, fear, shock and empathy. It's a difficult film to watch at times which perhaps some people didn't like. I don't think the point is to feel sorry for the character of the Joker. More to connect with his journey and his mental state and what might have led him to this point and, ultimately, pushed him over the edge. It's not to condone violence but to understand where it might originate from. I hope this gets the awards it deserves. "
5066," Best movie
", The only scene that was missing is the scene where they give to Joaquin Phoenix his academy award. Superb movue and acting. They turned a comic into a real eveyday story. 
5067," LEDGER FROM HEAVEN, JOB WELL DONE JAQ
", What should I say . A great movie experience . Joker is by far the best movie of the year. Characterisation performance story cinemetrography everything is top notch. A worthy Oscar contender. Not a single dull movement in the movie and the climax will blow your mind. Todd Phillips has done a remarkable job of showing the what really made Joker. Jaquelin Phoenix man what a performance . One the first scene to the last you just can't take eyes of him he lived the joker character . And he really deserves the Oscar unless it rigged. The pain the agony frustration anger just wow. So much this guy has given into this role . A Classic Masterpiece. And the question who is better joker between ledger and Phoenix . A tough one because both of them has immortalised this joker character. Don't miss this movie at any cost.

5069," Amazing actor
"," Joaquin's performance is really amazing, but scenario wasn't so rich "
5070," Critics don't 'get' this masterpiece
"," It's nearly a week and a half since I went to this movie on it's premiere, and still I'm deeply touched by it. I don't think I'm ever been touched by a movie this way. This isn't just a 'Joker' movie, it's much more than that, it isn't just a 'movie', it's a mirror of current society where people are pressed away, where people are forgotten. Of course everybodies tot a different taste, but you can't simply criticise this on it's plot and all different kind of things, what I read on critic reviews. People who have been hurt can relate to it like nearly no other movie before. Of course I can onderstand the view on how dangerous the movie can be (the lone wolf aspect), but maybe it's just a nessecary thing about it. It's nothin less than a true masterpiece like none other the past 20 years "
5071," The deal here
"," What does the Audience get that the critics don't? Critics are a laughing stock these days cause if this is too dark for them then I guess all slasher films are like butterflies and rainbows
This whole movie, it shows true emotions of what a mans world would be if society just pinned him down and stepped on him like he was nothing. It's absolutely insane how some people see this as a massive darkness. Not only that but the Media is pushing for a shooting to happen, if that ever does happen anytime soon it'll be on there own hands that they pushed this far. The Joker is an absolute masterpiece even if its dark it still shows the truth and builds up on how Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoneix) became THE JOKER "
5072," Perfect
"," This movie is wonderful, and it has different lines of interpretation, the classic ... joker really kills everyone and the one I saw, that is, that joker actually imagined some things, because as a beginning we see him already in the asylum ... a scene that can make us understand many things, in short, there are so many details that leave to the interpretation all to be seized with a second vision. an anthology film, it will become a cinema classic. "
5073," amazing in every aaspect
"," Movie of the decade, for sure the best picture in comics "
5074," Spellbinding
"," Would've liked more action but the Action that it had was Intense and life like. It was really well done, everything felt real, even though the action scenes were long like John Wick 3, the action it did have was so well done and realistic and believable that overall the whole film was satisfying and perhaps moreso. "
5075," Great film from start to finish
"," Joker has to be the best film I've seen this year and could be regarded as one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully made, it has great pacing and some of the best character development. We see a journey of a troubled aspiring comedian who takes blow after blow. Previously it would have been throw him into a science experiment gone wrong, now it is more throw him to society until he snaps. This is a very dark film, not for the faint hearted. The realism and beautiful build up is harsh, the angles taken are unique. It was great to see how the Joker started a movement and in the end got a following.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, Joaquin Phoenix gives an incredible performance. This is method acting at its best. He deserves the best actor Oscar for his performance and Director Todd Phillips deserves recognition for such a great film.

", Good movie go see it if you can its showing the story of the joker in a good way 
5077," incredible movie
"," As someone who has always been a fan of the Batman franchise, this movie was a breath of fresh air. It's beautifully acted by the amazing Joaquin Phoenix who completely embodies the role of the Joker and his origin. It's also believable as an origin story; it's raw, real, and leaves you thinking about your own morals. The cinematography is stunning, and in every single scene Joaquin steals the limelight with his uncomfortable, strange, frightening version of the Joker that you can't help but empathise with, despite his flaws. The entire movie had me in it's grip from start to finish, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well made thriller. "
5078," Joker
"," What an absolute masterpiece Joaquin Phoenix smashed it portraying the joker character, the film was well written, cinematography was amazing and the directing was superb it was nice seeing something on the lines of the joker since the dark knight was released what a great job Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger did. Watch Joker now!!! ü§° "
5079," It's the first time to watch a psychological study about a supervillain.
"," I know not any other movie of this kind. It's a psychological look at a derailled supervillain character. I understand why so many people can't cope with it. It's from the angle of the Joker. It shows his story how he is as a mental patient who struggles his personal and goverment induced circumstances. It shows that he is no bad guy in first, but how he changes when time and circumstances grow bad. And the society aspect. How are mentally ill persons treated by society. That are really strong issues for a movie. The range of emotions for this movie character sure can tend between ""poor guy"" and ""stop this guy"". But the movie shows up that nothing happens without a cause. And the acting of Joaquin Phoenix was really big cinema. I like the look of the movie, the flow, the perfect timesetting that didn't change over the whole movie. It's an absolute interesting story for Batman fans. This is the other side of the story, told from the side of the Joker. The end was a good peak for the movie so we went home very satisfied. We would wonder, if there wouldn't be a nomination at the Academy Awards. It's the strongest acting I saw this year. "
5080," An oscar worthy masterpeice.
"," Went and saw ""Joker"" today. Joaquin should get an award for that performance. I can see why people are walking out. It's an extremely poignant reminder of what is wrong with society today and how we treat one another matters. I personally think the movie should win lots of awards, not bans.<br/><br/>I went to it thinking it was going to be a lot of gratuitous violence. What I saw was someone who becomes a product of their environment. The tough part to watch is the journey that culminates with him becoming that product. I think a lot of people can relate, we all have those times where you feel constantly piled on. Couple that with mental illness and it's really sad movie. Very dark.. and i wouldnt even consider it an action movie and has a lot less violence than most horror flicks. "
5081," ""Society!""
"," It's not hard to see why The Joker is connecting with a lot of people, and know I don't mean the themes (I hope not). It is a very well executed character study that is brought to life by the fantastic performance of Joaquin Phoenix
The film is also good on a technical stand point at the same time, delivering a well awaited and satisfactory third act.
There isn't much more to be said other than I recommend it, and it's a film most people can get behind
Oh, and joker saying 'society', that was an epic gang weed representation moment "

"," I don't use the word ""Masterpiece"" very often when describing a film. Especially in this day and age, however this film is something to be revered. The acting, is second to none! This movie is Joaquin's swan song. The man deserves the highest accolades possible. An Oscar is coming his away, no doubt about it! The directing and cinematography are absolutely incredible!!! Do yourself a favour and see this piece of art! It is soulful, insightful, painful, emotional, comical, uncomfortable and so much more. Thank you to the entire team that brought this vision into fruition!! My faith in modern cinema has been restored. "
5087," More than expected
", Buzz created by joker before the release is extraordinary. From trailer it's obvious that Joaquin phoenix did a Oscar worthy performance. And in trailers they haven't given away much. I was unsure whether it will reach my expectations. But this film crosses my expectations. Nothing extravagant or mind blowing. But the way the director told the simple story combined with extra ordinary acting and cinematography is simply superb. Go watch it in cinemas if you haven't watched already.... :) 
5088," Ver Well done.
"," I think the key to any movie is to not go in with huge expectations based on what people say and reviews that you read. I think this movie was incredibly well done from the directing to the acting to the cinematography all of it. I always love a movie when they could transform the time seamlessly back 40 years even make the film look like it was made 40 years ago, gives you a real sense of how New York City really was back then. Joaquin Phoenix role as the joker was flawless, he absolutely killed the part. I really enjoyed the story, the character had so much substance, it made you laugh and made you want to feel bad. Now based on most peoples reviews do I think it was the greatest movie I have ever seen? No I do not but it was very good. I found it a little funny because this story in someway is kind of the same one we're living today To some extent... People who do good for themselves or have a little extra are bad and people who may be a little less fortunate and or criminals are the good guys. I give it eight out of 10 stars but it was very good I really enjoyed it. "
5089," BEST acting... but POOR script... Victory for Marketing team
"," No doubt the lead actor has given his best performance, but script is pretty much weak... takes too much time for buildup and still fails to show convincingly how joker becomes Messiah... Kind of character and premises they built can just justify rise of a serial killer but definitely not Messiah of criminal organization... Joker deserved better movie than this... "
5090," The perfect genesis for JOKER
",
5091," Despite too much hype, Joker is still good cinema
"," The Good: Generally when watching a movie, I begin drawing conclusions about what score I am going to give it at around the halfway point based off how I am feeling. Joker is unique in that I was so engrossed by this movie that I wasn't even properly reflecting at all on any rating during this film.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I was blown away by the production design, which gave a very Grimy Gotham that felt realistic, yet still unsettling in an incoming nightmare sort of way.<br/><br/>Following this of course is Joaquin's performance. While having everything being from Arthur's perspective led to some dissappointing moments (see The Bad), I have to commend the filmmakers for sticking so unflinchinglty to one point of view. Like it or not, we are stuck in Arthur's shoes and forced to empathize partly with him, and Joaquin Phoenix brings an amazing performance that ensures we are invested in the ride.<br/><br/>Zazie Beetz's character twist was a genuine rug pull twist that set up Joker's fractured mind well and the concept of him being an unreliable narrator.<br/><br/>The Bad: Overall, while I left the theatre satisfied, this movie still left me feeling a bit empty and like it could have been a bit more.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw for me in this movie was that Arthur didn't really have a journey. While the movie seems to argue that society has caused him to snap from the incidents presented in the movie, I feel that he was already there; that is, he was going to turn into Joker under any circumstances. For me, this ruins any real arc in the movie and lessens the tragedy of a good man going down the wrong path.<br/><br/>Moreover, the ending of this film rubbed me the wrong way the more I reflected on it. While it can be argued that Joker being an unreliable narrator is true to his character, this film was meant to be his origin and should provide a proper story. By saying that parts of his story was fiction (as the ending implied), it negates anything that happened in the movie and completely ruins any stakes that were there. This also just feels like a way to wave away the tons of plot holes that were in the movie, as it can just be blamed on the Joker lying.<br/><br/>If you take this story at face value, there was a lot of lazy storytelling or plot holes. The biggest ommission was explaining how society was collapsing in Gotham, and why people were so drawn to Arthur. Moreover, how did someone record Arthur's performance to show Robert De Niro's character and get him on the show? Did they have camcorders in the 70s? Who let Arthur enter the show with a gun? The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Finally, while the darkness of this film should be expected given the trailers, this was almost comically grim. Why does everything in Gotham seem intent to beat up Arthur?<br/><br/>Film Highlight: Arthur's interview on TV. What a tense, well-acted moment that also gave a huge light to what the film wanted to say of how society tends to give a blind eye to the downtrodden.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A well-acted, gorgeous film that unfortunately has some faults that keep it from being great. "
5092," Best comic movie!
"," Joker is for me the best comic film ever made, a masterpiece and a movie that deserves more than just an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix plays his role as a joker so good that you almost get goose bumps and just impressed, so fascinated and overwhelmed by his unique acting.<br/><br/>Camera, editing, music, backdrops ... everything is perfectly tuned for film and nothing is left to chance here. Here, people have thought and created one of the most intense film experiences.<br/><br/>A social critical, dramatic and terrifying film.<br/><br/>A masterpiece. 10/10 "
5093," The acting is great
"," It was just phenomenal. It's a slow movie, it takes to the last half an hour to really show the Joker. But I liked it. His slow deterioration was just beautifully displayed. How he lost everything that kept him from insanity. How he slowly transformed into the Joker, what was just his imagination and what was not. Joaquin Phoenix' performance is not comparable to Heath Ledger's, it's different. Every Joker until today, had their own spin on the character, but this one was really worthy of an Academy Award. First review, so excuse shallowness and plain obviousness and I'm drunk and tired. Sorry, last sentece: this movie lives up to my favorite movie Oldboy. "

It shows how one simple person like you and me got abused by the system and people close to him resulting in permanent mental and health damage. I would call this more of a social documentary than a superhero (or better put supervillain) movie.<br/><br/>I knew from the start that I would see myself in Arthur and I was right.

5111," Uncomfortable, yet brilliant
"," The first half of the film is arguably the strongest; the title charachters struggles with his prevalent mental health issues were both relatable and palpable, which leaves one feeling a level of pitty for him, and anger at a regimen that disregards the struggles of the poorest social classes under harsh austerity measures. Sound familiar? It's when he makes his innevitably transition to the titular Joker that the film starts to move from somewhat dark, tense drama about the effects of austerity on those with mental health ""issues"", to a film of apparent shock and awe that in contrast to the start of the film, made for an uncomfortable viewing as we see our charachter become deranged in a way that isn't respectful to those with mental health struggles. It seemed to paint those with severe mental health as dangerous and volatile. And because I stopped associating with his struggles half way through, the film felt longer than it was as I found myself wishing it would just end.
I'd give it a 5 out of ten but Joaquin Phoenix's acting was sublime, 10/10, and the art direction and cinematography was rather very good, 9/10. Made for a strong 7/10. "

5117," One of the best essays on schizophrenia I've seen
"," I can't help but thinking bout 'Joker'. This being the fourth day since watching, I can't seem to shake it from my memory. I wanted to write a review right away, but I also wanted to read feedback from others, to insure I wasn't missing anything. Turns out, I wasn't.<br/><br/>Mental health is a subject I know quite a bit about but schizophrenia is something I haven't really experienced myself. There have been many films about the subject, however Todd Phillips masterpiece 'Joker', is probably the best mainstream take. I don't use that word ""masterpiece"" lightly, it requires so many elements and in a cinematic quagmire 2019 has become, seeing a film like 'Joker' is a breath of fresh air. Yes, people haven't forgotten how to make a good movie.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure there is someone on here who was offended by 'Joker' and it's inhumanity, but that's kind of the point. Reality is, our protagonist is lacking the ability to reason properly and likewise, go a bit crazy from time to time in retaliation towards things which any rational human would also be upset by. It's just 'Joker', he just doesn't care anymore and armed with a snub nosed .45, he causes a bit of ruckus throughout New York, I mean Gotham. It's not because he was treated well, it's because he was lied to, manipulated and pushed around to the point of breaking.<br/><br/>'Joker' for better or worse, has a paper thin story, but it doesn't matter. Our journey is with Joaquin Phoenix, one of the industries most talented actors and nearly every frame has part of him in it. This very intense relationship between himself and the audience, is quite astounding. Every frame is rich in detail, bringing a level of realism to the character that makes his reactions almost feel good. ""Joker"" is a symptom of society and you almost HAVE to empathize with him, even though you know what he does is wrong. It's this internal struggle, which is the core of what makes this movie such a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Phillips took a basic and important story about a struggle happening to so many people these days and push it into the DC universe, so that everyone would want to see it. The film and character stands alone without the makeup, without the name. However, including the name ""Joker"" pushes it into another realm, with bigger financing and greater audience potential. It's those things that are the most clever aspects of this film. Otherwise, it would be another arthouse film like Joaquin Phoenix's phenomenal role in ""The Master"", one of my all-time favorite movies. This movie plays perfectly as a stand alone without the 2 minute scene that locks it into the DC universe. To me, that's good storytelling and even though reviewers everywhere are panning the film because they feel it's too shallow and panders to the DC universe too much, I disagree. One of the reviewers sticking points is the filmmakers ability to negate the entire story by the end. It's as if the audience has schizophrenia and is seeing/believing things that never happened. By the end, you're wondering how much of what you saw actually happened and what was up to interpretation.<br/><br/>The film was beautifully shot by a master cinematographer who initially was going to shoot on 35mm, but because Joaquin wanted to adlib much of the film in darkly lit locations, it was decided to shoot digitally for cost and time reasons. Warner agreed to make film prints however, as the Alexa 65's full-frame feel, translated really well to film. I was shocked how good the cinematography was, it looked and felt like an art piece. The editing, music and sound design were all spot on. There were so many technical challenges on the movie from huge scenes with thousands of extras in what appears to be downtown Manhattan, to a complete sub-story classic night time TV set that was used quite a lot. There were intense subway scenes that appear to be shot on the trains themselves. Heck, I only caught a few green screen effects in the movie, most of it was really shot on location. They had a great supporting cast from his mom to the TV show host played by Robert De Niro, both of whom did a great job. The 70mm print was excellent, not a single scratch or fleck of dirt and it always adds some depth to the film that the digital projection doesn't have.<br/><br/>I guess the only gripe I have about the film, is the laziness surrounding some of the ancillary characters and the lack of humility. However, it's overlooked because that's how Joker views them anyway, so in the long run, it doesn't matter. The lack of humility is part of the character and sure it would have been nice for the violence to be toned down a bit, I don't think it detracted from the film at all. Many people are concerned the story will instigate copycat's, but I don't think so. Yes the violence and subplots are concerning for younger audiences, I just don't think anyone wants to be Joker. I don't think anyone will idolize him to the point of being a copycat.<br/><br/>Honestly, I hope Phillips makes a Joker part 2, where he meets his nemesis Batman. Tell the Joker story from his point of view rather than Batmans. :) "

5119," While not a bad movie, it was a little disappointing
",
5120," A MUST WATCH
"," Take a bow Joaquin Phoenix! If this doesn't get him an Oscar, I don't know what will. A dark and gritty film that explores the mind of a broken and mentally deranged man, it's a difficult watch. The first half deals with Arthur's daily life and all things his mind has to go through. The second half is a bomb especially the last 20 minutes or so when he fully embraces his Joker persona - ""I thought my life was a tragedy, but now I realise it's a comedy"". There are some chilling murder scenes and revelations which is gonna make you question that how much of the film actually happened and how much of it was in his mind. Joaquin just set a benchmark for any future actor who's gonna take up the mantle of joker. Although it's an origin story, we see things from the perspective of Arthur who's a very unreliable narrator and so we don't exactly know what's real and what's his mental construct . A film which is gonna make your head spin for days , it's a must watch. "

"," If there is someone out there saying this movie is bad or even not as good or so so...that one, can go suck a co#k. This movie is a gentle kiss in your heart. I was almost crying while watching it. Thank you Joaquim and to all those who made this movie a CINEMA MASTERPIECE. "
5122," Simply Phenomenal!
"," What an amazing movie. Yes, it is very dark and sad. This movie truly depicts a tormented individual with a series of unfortunate events that led him to hate himself. However, at the same time he's able to charge a large group of followers that believe the world only cater to people with wealth and power. If I say more I will give the movie away. Go see this wonderful masterpiece. I simply loved it! "
5123," Masterpiece
"," From the cinematography to the acting to the script, every element was so emotionally engaging and raw, the joker couldn't be portrayed any better than how this movie did and I believe the movie did his character justice. The movie will make you question your own morals but that's what makes this movie so special. Joan Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his incredible depiction of the joker.
Highly recommend 10/10 "

"," The story was great, acting was suburb! Great depth to the character and arc to becoming the iconic joker!<br/><br/>The most disturbing thing was the mother who brought there 7yr old. This is not a kids movie. Disturbing content, that made me (42yr old) winch - even more with knowing a child was there. "
5130," A movie to feel
"," Every single detail of this masterpiece will definitely touch you in a certain level, the music will drag you deep to Arthur's feelings, the retro vintage style, the deep dark colours, and off course the magnificent outstanding performance of Joaquin Phoenix, he was the Concertmaster, he made us sad, angry, scared, devastated, hurt, felt betrayed and then scared again, he made us question our morality, our principals, or ethical judgement. He skinned us to the bones. "
5131," Compelling
"," Todd Phillips movies have all been entertaining, but never provocative and stimulating as this. The story is by far the finest curve that anyone could throw at the legendary joker. Right from the beginning, the movie takes you through spectacular visuals, and Lawrence Sher has done an amazing job. Set in the city of Gotham, the movie revolves around the evolution of the joker we all know. But this time, we are all with the joker and without us knowing we justify his rancor, his eccentricities. Joaquin Pheonix blazes with his impeccable rendering. He lives the man; he lives joker. This is what movie making is all about. A dark gritty movie that creeps into your skin and stays there forever. Joker is funny, darkly funny, like the note in his journal, 'I hope my death will make more cents than my life.' Compelling. "
5132," Stunning psychological dark thriller
"," Let me start by saying it was a truly masterpiece. It's not your every day comic book based movie it is neo noir original movie with some Martin Scorsese's taxi driver vibes in it.
The movie refect a real word anxiety it's a merchant of anarchy and controversial insane.
The story line was so good and prefect caracter developpement driven by great Todd Phillips direction and writing and astonishing Joaquin Phoenix performance. Add to that the great cinematography and beautiful soundtrack all together make it a brilliant phenomenal film "
5133," Already Going For Great Movie, Even If It Isn't
"," All of you people on the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and more garbage places for critics, are just too opinionated about movie ratings. You try to think about every aspect known to be possible and think really deep, to make mixed and low ratings. You have to realize that the people that rate this movie don't care about any of that stuff. So once you rate this movie low on the Metacritic ratings, you lessen the chance of more and more people going to see this movie. Which makes the profits for the movie bad, and makes the producers sad. "

"," TL;DR It's a great film. Go see it! Personally, I will always love Heath Ledger the best as the definitive live-action Joker, but this Joker is now a close second. ...Sadly, the media has lost its mind. I went to the theater with my cousin. I took a quick pit stop at the restroom as everyone should before a movie. My cousin finds us some good seats on the fourth row from the front. I enter the room. The trailers have started so it's quite dark. I go down the front of the screen and scan the room for my cousin. I see several people get up, looking nervous at me. ""Chill, People! I'm just looking for my cousin!"" I spot him, very embarrassed, and hurry to my seat. The rest of the screening was normal. I could feel that everyone was on edge though thanks to the media freaking everyone out. "
5145," Good film, astonishing acting
"," The film is very good but not a masterpiece. The soundtrack could be much better (I would suggest Hans Zimmer, he is great to create an atmosphere), the script was good enough BUT the acting of Phoenix was excellent, he was amazing, I always appreciated his acting skills, I praised him from time ago, when he played in Gladiator and always knew he is a great actor. Well, with this performance he is being known to every single person in the world. Whoever didn't know his acting skills, now he knows!! "

The movie was so realistic, unlike other DC movies, that it could be an independent not DC movie, telling the story of a guy that has been through a lot.
2 hours were not enough, everyone wanted more of this. Congratulations to the production and THANK YOU for a great movie experience!!! "

The cinematography, the writing, the fantastic direction and of course, the mind blowingly brilliant performance from Phoenix.<br/><br/>When people ask, ""Will I like this film?"", with most I can generally tell them, Endgame - If you like Marvel it will be fantastic, Once upon a time in Hollywood - If you like classic Tarantino possibly not, The Lion King - the original you have to, it's the law, but the remake possibly not. Joker I just can't. It's so ... so ... so unpredictable, and surely for this of all films, that's a pretty good position to be in. "

A spin-off that fills the gap between 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'. Perfectly shows Emotions, struggle for survival, and mental health of people who depends on bottom-line of society, and moreover how American society treats them. A perfect answer within the story, ""why society needs to respect people of any class?""and ""get out of fear of Clowns"" and people who are delusional.<br/><br/>Hats-off to the director Todd Phillips, for finding a fitting story for this movie. No words for Joaquin Phoenix, least an Oscar for token of appreciation. "
5156," A Joker we've never seen before
"," First and foremost, what a stunning picture. Every scene in this film is a piece of art, both the cinematography and the acting.
While watching ""Joker"", I found myself waiting for that moment. The moment where Arthur Fleck will snap. And boy, did he snapped. We all know that he's the villain of the story, but some how, we are rooting for him. Overall, I was sad, afraid, and satisfied all throughout the movie. Big props to Joaquin Phoenix who offered us a brand new joker that is also familiar to us comic book fans. I'm sure that I'm not only speaking for myself when I say that his portayal of the Joker deserves some recognition. To the man himself, Todd Phillips, on behalf of us who understands the villain, thank you very much. "

5179," Just ok....
"," I was looking forward to this for a long time. Dont get me wrong, it's dark, it is well filmed and the performance from Phoenix is excellent. I have to say though, it took 2 hours to get to where it needed to be, and then it ended. Maybe building up to the next one? As for all those saying it will encourage mass shootings....try not selling guns! That may help "
5180," Film like no other
"," One needs to be at the top of its craft to make film like this. I'm struggling to find excuse why I didn't give it 10/10. It's just I don't believe in perfection that 10/10 represents, but this masterpiece is as close as it gets. 9.99999/10.
Didn't believed Joakim could top his Master performance, but Joker is on different level. This is hard film, but it's riveting at the same time. It's so immersive like no other comic book based movie.
Photography is hypnotic. This is the best version of Gotham City ever. Script is so layered and ""tight"". No silly nonsense and holes. Directing is the definition of craft. Tod is in league of its own. Casting is flawless. Main role is wow! Just wow! As someone wrote ""the hype is real"". It's magical. Yet disturbing. Uncomfortable, but fascinating. I need to see it again, I want to see it again, but I'm not sure I have mental strength, because this is not fun go out flick for idling brain. This movie will light up all of your gray cells. "
5181," A truly unforgettable film
"," Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance and the gritty, dark storytelling abilities of Todd Phillips combine to make, in my opinion, one of the best movies in recent memory. Through the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, it isn't as dark or gripping as the trailers portray it. But after the subway scene (if you haven't seen it yet, you'll know exactly what I mean when you do see it), the mood of the movie immediately snaps to dark and disturbing and the viewer can feel it. The grittiness and truly twisted nature of Arthur Fleck's persona helps create the most dark and gripping story since Silence of the Lambs. This movie, especially the ending, will most likely stick with you for a long time, as I know it will for me. "
5182," His acting.... Two thumbs up!!
"," The acting skill... absolutely 5 STARS!!! He definitely evolved into the character. His transformation was unbelievable!! The effort he put into this movie is impressive. Just wish the script could be more thrilling, more ""OMG"" scene. "
5183," Its so dark that will leave a scar in you...
"," Dont know what to say without spoiler, however if i want to describe this movie it pure whiskey. No CGI, very basic sound effects, its just pure solid acting.<br/><br/>Best character building I've ever watched since the God Father; the unpredictable ideas, adding to it the great touch of Robert Denero.<br/><br/>I hope this movie will be nominate to the movie of the year with best acting and best script<br/><br/>Do i recommend watching it? only if you can handle pure dark drama...

"," Joker from beginning to end keeps you enthralled, not only through the eyes of Arthur Fleck but Gotham city as its slowly crippling before our eyes. Joker has such ambiguity towards a lot of its subjects and scenes that there is no concrete answer to a lot of what happens in the film which is amazing because it leaves you asking questions and starting a conversation and debate with other movie goers, I dont want to give too much away other than to simply watch the movie. "
5192," Excellent
"," Excellent dark, convincing potential background story for the Joker. Very believable. Slow paced in some places but that is necessary for the story to unfold leading to a perfect climax. The atmosphere in the entire movie is just stunning. The soundtrack worked really well too. You aren't always sure what is going on in the Joker's mind but it is a bit more straightforward than what I thought this movie would be liked. It sticks to 70s and 80s movie telling conventions.<br/><br/>Phoenix obviously did a sterling job which has rightfully been pointed out many times.<br/><br/>I'd actually like this to be a fresh start to a new Batman reboot and another meet up with Superman too but I've heard that is very unlikely to happen.<br/><br/>I do hope, if we get more superhero movies churned out, they are more in this style than the CGI style we have had too much off. Maybe some CGI companies will go out of business but we would get far better cinema and more creators behind the camera rather than copy cats.<br/><br/>I loved every minute.<br/><br/>For me the best movie of the year. I cannot see another Disney Abramsified Star Wars movie beating it. "
5193," Outstanding!! Joaquin is absolutely breath taking
", Joaquin Phoenix puts on one of the best acting performances I have ever seen! The score and his acting had you on the edge of your seat the whole time. You were just waiting for him to explode...absolute master piece if it does not sweep the Oscar's it would be a absolute travesty. 
5194," Best movie of the year
"," Joker by Todd Phillips is a film masterpiece of recent years. A film that keeps you disturbed from beginning to end, is a unique and unforgettable experience. Joaquin Phoenix made the best Joker and my favorite, worthy Oscar winner, the secondary cast is excellent (not to mention the wonderful Robert De Niro excellent actor). A soundtrack, photography, magnificent scenes so well directed, a sublime and excellent script. The last half hour is bright, sublime, disturbing, I was never so shocked and so attentive to watch each scene, watching this movie in the cinema is something unique and I will never forget. It should not be denied that she is the great candidate for many Oscars awards and will be the film that will be cultured in years. Excellent and magnificent. The best movie of the year. "
5195," The brilliance of Joker and the deliberate misreadings on both sides
",
5196," A study in human pain - masterful
"," The mastery behind this movie is that avoids any unnecessary storyline and focuses on the torment experienced by the key character, Arthur Fleck, aka ""Joker"". This is a study in human pain, as experienced by a wretchedly unlucky man who faces a life of utter misery in a world of banal, casual cruelty, inflicted as if absolutely normal. It is, to all intents and purposes, a film all about one man - the other characters are merely adjuncts. If this film has a fault, it is that it ends too suddenly, without an adequate climax, but the performance of Phoenix is completely masterful and mesmerising. If this doesn't win an Oscar I don't know what will. "
5197," great but not epic
"," The basic story-idea of a tough childhood and a medical condition
that causes his uncontrolled laughter especially when he is emotionaly on a total downswing is something that makes Arthur Fleck aka Joker very believable as a ""real"" character and Phoenix's performance here is extraordinary as i expected it to be.<br/><br/>The movie is great but i didnt feel that it was epic to give a full 10,
something was missing for me, Arthur Fleck sure has the crazieness of
Joker but at the same time seems not to be the brightest bulb in the chandelier. "
5198," Great film, no question just not realistically a 10
"," I don't disagree with anyone that this is a great film and Phoenix's performance should take out a fair few awards, but in saying that it isn't perfect. "
5199," Utterly Breathtaking
"," This film follows the journey of the destruction of a man's soul, and a world that has no limit to its cruelty. Joker is an astonishing movie where each aspect compliments the other to form a oscar worthy performance from Joaquin pheonix, and a beautifully dark story that is brutal and devastating. A must watch which is not only masterfully crafted, but will please Joker and movie fans alike. The movie's disturbing tone is accompanied by an amazing score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, who perfectly captured hownit feels to be alone and be granted no love. Joker is a breathtaking film created as a message for the audience of 2019 to share it's story to those who need to know they're not alone or to spread awareness on mental illness. An experience we will not be pleasured with for a very long time. "
5200," Why so serious!!
"," Joker sucked and here's a few reasons why:
1. You feel like you're waiting for it to begin the whole time since there's no premise or real plot except Arthur fleck (joker) getting bullied.
2. There's no story line, there's no obstacle and there's intention. There's nothing to see except for a man who's mentally ill get picked on and beat up by society (real original).
3. Character development doesn't quite do the joker justice as he's portrayed as more sick and sad than insane and mad.<br/><br/>Ultimately this is a total piece of crap that Hollywood knighted as cool because there's a stupid psychological twist that doesn't surprise you at all. And when it happens, it's the most melodramatic scene that doesn't even play out all the way before it cuts to a new scene.<br/><br/>Hollywood Please don't let the guy who directed the hangover do something this terrible again to such a classic character. "
5201," This will go down alongside Taxi Driver and Goodfellas as one of Scorsese's greatest works
"," What more can be said about this film than has already been said? I could very easily say this film is a masterpiece and leave it at that, but I believe such an action would be a disservice to this film.<br/><br/>When the film was first announced, I was initially skeptical about the idea of having a Batman-universe film without Batman: FOX had already come up with 'Gotham'; the end result of which ultimately did integrate a Batman origin story into its plot, thus leaving it to 'Joker' to be the first to accomplish this goal. That, coupled with the high expectations of Phoenix's performance following the late Heath Ledger's iconic interpretation and the less-than-stellar performance from Jared Leto in 2016's 'Suicide Squad', were enough to worry me about how this film would portray a Joker origin. In hindsight, I needn't have been worried.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix's performance is without a doubt Oscar-worthy. His ability to guide the audience towards feeling sympathetic to the character of Arthur Fleck while simultaneously horrifying the viewers with the atrocities committed by the deeply flawed protagonist. However it is the slow deterioration from a deranged man into depraved one that is most unsettling. As someone who rarely feels the overwhelming sense of anticipation during films like Joker that others seem to feel, this film was an exception. Two scenes that stood out for this were (SPOILERS) Fleck's brutal killing of Randall, and the uncomfortably suspenseful Murray Franklin interview at the film's climax. It was at these points that the unpredictability of the Joker became immensely terrifying, as the audience lost the ability to guess what would happen. It was these moments that perfectly encapsulated what the character of the Joker was about - unpredictability.<br/><br/>The cinematography and soundtrack were equally magnificent, perfectly reflecting and complementing the performances of the actors on screen. Todd Phillips' script was marvellous, contrasting the realistic depictions of Arthur Fleck's mundane, depressed life with the surreal caricature of anarchy that he became when he donned the Joker makeup in the last act of the film. The unreliability of Fleck's narration was depicted clearly through the infrequent-but-impactful shifts in reality (for example, when it was revealed that Fleck's relationship with Sophie Dumond was merely a figment of his imagination), thus leaving the audience ever wondering what was actually 'real'. This questioning was furthered through Phillips' artistic direction, drawing ambiguity in certain scenarios that unfolded (such as the shot following Fleck out of Sophie's apartment, which led the audience to believe that he killed her, though it was not explicit), which is also a remarkable move.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film is regarding the (in my opinion) unnecessary inclusion of Bruce Wayne, and the setup of his transformation into Batman. Although before the film's release I was concerned that this would not be included, the film would have worked equally well - if not better - without Bruce Wayne, making me think his inclusion was a last-minute decision; he was only in two scenes, after all. However, this is certainly not enough to detract from the masterful execution of almost every other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>I don't often give a film a 10/10 review, as such a grade should only be awarded to the greatest of the great, in my opinion. It is for this exact reason that I have given this film 10/10, and there is no doubt in my mind that the Golden Lion won by the film at the Venice Film Festival will not be the last accolade it receives, and I eagerly anticipate the 2020 Oscars. "
5202," Amazing. A modern masterpiece
"," I did enter the cinema with some doubts regarding this movie. Could it really be as good as the reviewers claimed?
The local newspaper gave it 4/5 but i can only say that they were dead wrong. This is a true masterpiece.
The acting, the camera angles, the characters. Everything worked together making me forget time and from time to time I found myself sitting and gape at what occured on screen.
I will for certain buy another ticket and watch it at least one more time. "
5203," Arguably the finest portrayal of JOKERüëè
",
5204," A chilling character study that works in spite of its cliche script.
"," Joker is a character study about an insane person. It's not a comic book movie, it's not trying to be. Todd Phillips, who directed the Hangover movies, rose to the occasion here and made a solid origin story about the Joker. However, it's Joaquin Phoenix who makes it memorable and great.<br/><br/>The script has flaws, the biggest one being the lack of subtlety in the first half of the movie. I know it's not supposed to be subtle, but the way things constantly go wrong for Arthur - he gets beat up, he loses his job, he gets humiliated - is handled so clumsily.<br/><br/>There are a couple of shocking moments. There's a reason this gets compared to Taxi Driver. It's a little clunky at first, but things come together wonderfully in the last act. It's nice to see a movie from the villain's perspective for a change. Things are looking up for DC. "
5205," Outstanding
",
5206," Making the Villain the Main Character, Without Making Him a Hero
"," This is a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable cinematic experience, its atmosphere as brutal as its score is devastating, layered with multiple conflicting tones and an underlying senselessness of societal irony. But perhaps its greatest achievement is the performance at the heart of this grim character study, so alien, so irredeemable and so uncompromising in its amorality as to render it the antithesis of a relatable figure; told through a lens of masterful misdirection that fully realises the Clown Prince of Crime in a manner never seen before. "

5210," Gorgeous, disturbing and satisfying
"," A truly stunning and surprising film. I went in with pretty low expectations and I was honestly shocked Todd Phillips made this. Joaquin Phoenix nails this performance and cemented himself as perhaps the second best Joker ever. It's just a genuinely incredible performance. I love the cinematography, set design and music. The film just oozes with character and panache. It's a slow burn, but well worth it. My only issues is that it didn't know where to quite end and some of the political commentary was a little hamfisted. But if I leave a Joker movie a little disturbed as to how some among us may interpret the message...I have to say, that's a successful Joker movie. "
5211," 8.5/10 for these reasons
"," Cons first
1) The musical score left a lot to be desired. Sometimes it was too heavy for the scene. Sometimes it was non-existent where the scene needed it.
2) The mob support seemed a bit far fetched. I know Gotham is crime central but I can't imagine all those people praising a murderer and actively helping him out.
3) The first portion of the movie was a bit long.<br/><br/>Pros
1) I love this version of Joker. I like his descent into insanity.
2) I like how this Joker ties in with the Waynes.
3) They explain why nobody knows his real name (his name is a mystery in the comics).
4) They have Joe Chill do the deed to Thomas a Martha Wayne (also comic accurate). I like how Chill was just a random Joker fanatic. Bruce Wayne is going to really come after Joker and that is exciting. "
5212," You Will Cry, Laugh and Learn
"," I knew this movie would be great since they chose Joaquin Phoenix, I even didn't watch the trailer. However, still it blow my mind. Fall in love with it and Joaquin at first scene. I wish if I can forget it and rewatch it again and again. Thanks to everyone for making such a movie. "

"," This is not a movie for children, let me clear about that. For all the times we have seen the character of Joker portrayed, this is always who I envisioned Joker to be.<br/><br/>Thank you to all involved in creating such a masterpiece of a movie, and showing old school comic book collectors the true origins of the Joker and his darkness amongst the backdrop of the joke of his life that leads him to be the perfect nemesis for the Batman. "
5216," Uncomfortably amazing
", Felt so uncomfortable through the whole movie but afterwards all I wanted to do is go out and hug people and let them know they are seen. I think the message is clear. BE KIND TO EVERYONE!! This wasn't a feel good movie but it was definitely eyeopening to treat everyone kindly no matter if they arent (normal). Everyone has a breaking point. It's each person job to push them as far away from the breaking point as possible by kind words and actions. It's as easy as a smile! 
5217," Cinematic history- 10/10
"," Joker is perfect, it connects perfectly with DC universe without trying too hard. It's freaky, graphic and dark without coming across as forced or cheap. Overall it's a stunning film. The soundtrack is perfect (Cream-White Room towards end is fitting/awesome). Phoenix is superb, he gives so much poignancy and meaning to literally *every* word he says - ""All I have are negative thoughts"" you can literally see the pain in his eyes when he says it. It's fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall, Joker is my new favourite film. Please go and watch it and decide for yourself. It's too good not to...<br/><br/>And if it's not for you? That's ok! You probably just watched JP's Oscar nomination film so at least you can still be a part of cinematic history! "
5218," The perfect prequel
",
5219," The Joker our times deserves.
"," I must admit that I was not really looking forward to this film, a standalone movie built around the greatest rogue in Batman's rogue's gallery, where the Caped Crusader would not appear. Plus I had some difficulty seeing Joaquin Phoenix in the part. Then I saw the trailer, and I was blown away, and after seeing the finished product, I am happy to say the hype was true, JOKER more than stands alone as a film, free from any Batman franchise, it is a masterpiece of the anti-hero genre, a film that shines a light in a dark, dark place, and is not afraid show us what is there. It is also a film that harks back to great era of film making, as director Todd Phillips has said his primary influences were TAXI DRIVER, and KING OF COMEDY, both directed by Martin Scorsese. This is more than reinforced by the casting of Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a glib talk show host who could easily be a successor to Jerry Lewis's Jerry Langford. There is also more than a little NATURAL BORN KILLERS and BIRDMAN in the mix as well, especially the latter, as we are often seeing events through the eyes of a mentally ill protagonist, and that what we are seeing on the screen at any given time might all be happening in his head.<br/><br/>One thing that must be said, JOKER is not a comic book movie, it's not based on some classic arc from DC comics, there is no convoluted plot, full of action and intrigue. The movie centers on Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, who is in literally every scene. Arthur is a marginalized citizen of Gotham City in the early 80's, a dark concrete and brick jungle, over run with predatory criminals, literally drowning in garbage. But the rot on the outside in nothing compared with what is festering inside Arthur, who makes a living, such as it is, as a clown, but there is clearly trauma and damage in Arthur's past, as evidenced by his uncontrollable outbursts of laughter at any given time. Arthur is saddled with an ailing mother, played by the superb Francis Conroy, who in the past was employed by the Wayne family. Arthur has delusions of being a comedian, a true clown upon the stage, welcomed by people like Franklin, giving joy and happiness to the world, but you can't give what you don't possess, and eventually Arthur starts giving back to this world twice over the pain it has inflicted on him. The pace of this movie is best described as a slow, but inexorable, circling of the drain, as Arthur descends into true madness, and in that madness, finds an empowering identity, and a legion of adoring followers, never mind all the corpses he leaves behind him. When does the victim become the predator, and when do we stop having sympathy for him? Those are some of the many questions JOKER asks, and leaves it up to the viewer to provide the answer.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix does not give a performance, so much as a transformation; from the body language, to the weary voice, to the wary eyes, he creates what is destined to be one of the all time great psychos in movie history. It is a performance where so much is done with the face, from the glee in his eyes when Arthur entertains a room full of sick children, to the joy he beams when in one of his delusions, De Niro's Franklin asks him to come out of the audience and stand beside him on the stage, to the smoldering hurt writ on his face during his encounter with Thomas Wayne, played by Brett Cullen, and made up to suggest Donald Trump. To me, the iconic image of this film is Arthur, in full make up, dancing down the steps as he heads to a fateful appearance on the Franklin show. The other hero of this film is Todd Phillips, the director of comedies like OLD SCHOOL and THE HANGOVER. Phillips, who laments that he can no longer make the kind of bro comedies that put him on the map, has made the complete opposite of those films. In these times, when deranged nobodies, not unlike Arthur, become instantly notorious with acts of mass violence, Phillips has given us a glimpse of where some of this darkness comes from. Though it does seem incongruous that Phillips stages big protests against the wealthy at the dawn of the Reagan era, when the majority of the country was buying into supply side economics and the trickledown theory, the downside of which would only come much later.<br/><br/>I am sure the purists will complain that you can't have the Joker without Batman, Phillips does clearly ground this Gotham in a DC universe, just not maybe the DC universe of any future franchise, as the finale teases us with possibilities of what might be. One thing for sure, we do get one iconic image from the Batman origin that will forever link Arthur to Bruce Wayne, but the violence in JOKER, when it comes, hits like a gut punch, brutal and horrific, and nothing cathartic about it, the kind of bloodshed impossible to do in a big budget PG-13 super hero blockbuster. Maybe it's just as well, if, like Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, his cinematic forefathers, we never see the like of Arthur Fleck again.<br/><br/>Where does Joaquin Phoenix's Joker stand when matched against Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, not mention Mark Hamill's voice work on BATMAN TAS or Cameron Monaghan's on TV's GOTHAM? I don't think it's a competition, each era gets the Joker it deserves, and who can deny that Phoenix's take the character is a perfect fit for ours. "
5220," Perfect
"," I don't care what nitpicky minuscule details arise in the coming month. I don't care if there are continuity errors or plot holes that I haven't seen. This film is perfect. This film is everything it set out to be, and everything I wanted it to be. I don't wnat to spoil it. Watch this movie and support it. We need more Comic Book Movies like this. Phenomenal "
5221," Dark, disturbing, and wildly entertaining.
"," Joker brings something fresh to the screen in the form of a reimagining of one of DC's most beloved characters. Joker not only offers a great origin story for the character but gives us interesting visuals and a fitting soundtrack. Along with all of that, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy- he fully delivers in the part, and leaves me wanting more of his rendition of the character. The film isn't perfect, but it's definitely one of the greatest we've seen this year. "
5222," Awesome
"," A great movie well worth watching. The acting of Mr. Phoenix is outstanding.

Hopefully this film will pick up a heap of awards. It also handles a.delicate subject matter and really reminds you that there are many lenses which people see life through. A work of art pure and simple. "

"," Joker is Masterpiece it's amazing, it's risk taking that's why I love it. The movie shocks you with what it does with the joker character it's a character study about a man with problems and people just turn their back on him and it's done in a realistic way some moments you feel bad for the joker. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as the Joker it's a different take on the character. This movie is amazing to look at the scenes are shot beautiful but yet creepy movie of the year. "

5231," Absolutely Awesome üòÉüëç
"," I was a bit weary about whether Joaquin Phoenix could pull off this character, he did an absolutely amazing job. I like how this film ends in the creation of one of Batmans ultimate nemesis's and fits in to an almost prequel to the 1989 Batman movie.<br/><br/>Compared to the Dark Knights Heath Ledger's character this Joker sees a grim and dark transformation gradually throughout the movie as an individual who did not intend on inspiring a movement. In terms of who the better Joker is, in my opinion Joaquin Phoenix clinches the top spot purely because of his ability to portray a man who is trying to connect with society and the way he is transformed as society fails him is captured well.<br/><br/>Well worth watching and purchasing, it left me wondering at the end from the Jokers point of view is he his own hero or a genuine bad guy. "

"," I can't remember the last time I felt so uncomfortable throughout the entirety of a film. It was engrossing yet creepy. This depiction of Joker was mesmerizing to me, I couldn't take my eyes off Joaquin Phoenix ever. It was funny in ways I didn't expect and equally moving. It's so hard for me to try to quantify this movie.., it was a character study as well as a look at human behavior in general as well as a sorta action piece and a drama with some comedy wrapped with an all around creepiness to it is about the best I can say. It's definitely a movie you'll likely think about long after you finish watching it. Definitely recommend. "
5236," A scary yet exhilerating decent into madness, beautifully portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix
"," This film is one of few films I was excited for heading into the fall season. At first this movie may seem like a typical ""Mental Illness"" movie, but it claims to be so much more than anticipated. Before this screening, I managed to hop into another movie on my list for fall, It Chapter Two. Both essentially about madmen, but Joker was far superior.<br/><br/>The film follows a man named Arthur Fleck (portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix) who works at a corporation that sends clowns to corporations in need (ie. Record Stores, Children's Hospitals, Television Screenings, etc.) He is brutally beat up by a group of teenagers and is at risk of being fired. His Homelife is not what you would call pleasant either. He still lives with his sick mother, Penny, who, due to being in her elder years, cannot do much without Arthurs help. One of his fellow co-workers Randall gives Arthur a gun for protection from ever being hurt again. That night, Arthur develops a slight obsession with a girl named Sophie, a single mother who lives down the hall.<br/><br/>While working at a children's hospital, Arthurs gun falls out of his pocket and thus making him fired from his work. That same night, a girl is being catcalled by a few men who work for Wayne Enterprises on a subway. Due to his mental illness, out of spite and fear, Arthur begins to laugh maniacally. One of the men sings ""Send In The Clowns"" and Arthur feels threatened and shoots all three of the men. Once finding a safe spot to himself, Arthur scarily dances and washes the blood off of his face.<br/><br/>Arthur fulfils his dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian and attempts to make the audience laugh with his brutally dark sense of humour. The audience does not make one sound. Later on, Penny seems awfully scared of something, revealing a letter to Arthur that he is Thomas Wayne's (Bruce Wayne's father) son. One night, arriving home, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized, while Arthur is taken away from the scene to be interrogated by policemen, who ask him about the three men who were killed in the subway murders. While in the hospital, Arthur watches ""The Murray Franklin Show"", who shows a clip of Arthur doing his standup. However, it is only used to laugh at Arthur and not with Arthur.<br/><br/>A riot commences when Thomas claims that the population of Gotham is filled with clowns. Outraged, Arthur and the others fight back. Arthur sneaks into a movie theatre, disguised as an usher and finally meets Thomas, his biological father. Thomas claims all of this is false and that he is not the insane one, but Penny is. Arthur, outraged by his comment, storms out, but later learns that this is the truth and that Penny is mentally insane and that Arthur was adopted.<br/><br/>Outraged by the truth, Arthur storms into the hospital and strangles Penny with a pillow, killing her. That night, Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced, but Sophie acknowledges and tells Arthur that his fantasies of going on dates and her coming to his stand up shows were all make believe and that they only met once in an elevator. Arthur returns to his apartment to receive a call from Murray Franklin's assistant, asking him to make an appearance on the show. He accepts.<br/><br/>Arthur gets ready for his big appearance on the show by dying his hair lime green and putting on some white makeup, creating the iconic Joker that we, the audience, know today. His old co-workers, Randall and Gary bring him a gift to show their gratitude for the passing of Arthurs Mother. Arthur remembers that Randall bullied Arthur in the past and murders him with a pair of scissors. He lets Gary go, for he never did anything to harm Arthur. He makes his way down to the show.<br/><br/>Before the curtain rises, Arthur personally asks Murray (Robert DeNiro) if he could be introduced as Joker, claiming it is part of his stand-up bit. While backstage, Arthur does a dance, ensuring that something eerie is yet to come. While on the show, Arthur realizes that Murray wronged him before, for poking fun at him from his standup bit. With his gun, he shoots Murray in the head and chest and then escapes the set. He is arrested by officers, but as they make their way back to the station, they are rammed by protestors in an ambulance. The protestors grab Arthur and place him on top of the car for recovery. The camera then flips to an alleyway, to once again recreate Thomas Wayne's and his wife's death, ironically not committed by Joker. Arthur wakes up and smiles at his state and looks around at the protestors burning the city in content. Joker is put into Arkham Asylum for questioning. He escapes, leaving bloody footprints behind.<br/><br/>Joker 2019 is one of those movies that you can only watch once. It is wholesome and somehow, someway, you feel a sense of sympathy of Arthur. However, once the movie hits its 2 hour mark, you are reeling to be taken away from this mans the story. The movie is divided into 2 acts. Arthur and Joker. Arthurs half is brutal, almost eye-gauging. Every moment you are not indulged into the story and quite frankly, it feels like time wasted. It is all made up in the 2nd half of the movie when the descent truly begins to show. You are clutching your seat, aching for more. It is perfect, but it isn't due to the first act. Joker is also one of those movies that you can only see once.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give Joker an 8. (First act is a 5/10, Second is an 11/10. 8+11=16 divided by two is an 8) "

Still an incredible movie by every standard and shouldn't be missed. 
5245," You are the clowns! You all failed. A 10+!
"," Most people don't get this movie at all. They think it's about rich vs poor, or some other over used theme. It is not. This film is deep in so may levels but the one that most missed is that it is one big middle finger to you, the audience, the people in the city, the media, the government, and the society as a whole. It is far from trying to draw your sympathy towards the Joker, at the contrary, it is designed to tell you the audience to wake the hell up. To be attentive, to be more human, to listen to other people instead of talking over others. To understand where we are going as people. To not sweat the small things and stop being stupid condescending clowns (such as those talk show hosts). An absolute masterpiece. Go see it. "
5246," AUDIENCE CLAPPED AT ENDING! IT'S A CLASSIC MOVIE NOW.

You FELT his pain, SYMPATHIZED with him. You wanted anyone who died in the movie to die because they sort of deserved it.<br/><br/>This movie is on my CLASSIC MOVIE list and will be watched more than once, twice and three times.<br/><br/>When an audience claps at the end of a movie, well, you know it's going to be up for all awards and win. Let's hope so anyway! "

All it needed was for one to be brave enough. Joaquin Phoenix clealry steals the show with his stunning performance and his devotion to the character.

"," It makes you uncomfortable, and this is what we want from Joker. Joaquin Phoenix truly did a fantastic job. He is one of the best actor of this era. "
5264," Outstanding film showcasing Mental Illness
"," First and foremost, this is an outstanding film being it is a stand alone film. Also, the Soundtrack and Score really makes this film. Todd Phillips utilizes amazing songs that works well with the characters inner thoughts.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of twists and turns. I will say it is engaging from the beginning, but has some slow parts in it. This film is very dark and has dark humor as well. It does have some gore in it without the big use of CGI. I like how the film is based in the late-70/early-80's and shows how the Wayne's play into the film, without taking over. It also gives a different view of Thomas Wayne and the Wayne's in general.<br/><br/>Arthur Fleck was let down by the system and it really shows. Going day in and day out into his only job and how he deals with his demons and what he must feel daily with medication and then without medication. As a healthcare professional, this film should be shown to students when it comes to mental health/illnesses. This film showcases depression (manic), psychosis, hallucinations, and bi-polar and how society deals will these type of patients.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job playing the main role and gives an Oscar Winning Performance! Heath Ledger's performance was great, but Joaquin shows a different side of Joker and takes it up to whole new level!<br/><br/>Could this film be watched at home and still enjoy it...the answer is yes. Should it be viewed in theaters...the answer is yes! The cinematography is great but sometimes feels like a student documentary in some scenes (camera shakes) and slightly weird angles. And again, the story does slow down in parts.<br/><br/>I give this film an 8 for those reasons. So go out and see it for yourself and see how it stacks up to your standards! "
5265," You'll not see anything quite like this
"," Just got back from watching this film. It really IS that good. Phoenix completely nails this and captures everything the joker should be. Awkward, odd and unpredictable. His performance is well worth an Oscar nod. I'll be talking about this film for a long long time. A must see movie 10/10 without a doubt. "
5266," Joaquin Phoenix's performance, unparalleled
"," I've always believed in Joaquin Phoenix's talent and he only needed two movies to prove that but in this, he completely transfigured into Joker. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver we're forever in your debt. "
5267," Mind boggling
"," Made me question a lot after the movie !
Didn't expect what happened "
5268," Masterpiece
"," I merely wanted to add well deserved stars, previous comments expressed all the awe I experienced watching this excellent movie! "
5269," wow !
"," One of the best movies in my life .. story .. acting .. director.. sound tracks every thing is marvelous
you must see this movie .. it's hard to see movie like this for years coming "
5270," Joker, winner of all OSCARS.
"," A beautiful, dark and interesting story about a man's decent into madness. Joaquin Pheonix played possibly one of the best jokers of all time. "
5271," The antihero we love!
"," This film is a masterpiece. Everything about it, the setting, the pace of the film, the darkness and the storyline of course. The joker is an amazing character and they explored this to it's core. Mr Phoenix will without doubt win an Oscar for this role. His portrayal of joker was without doubt breathtaking. Heath ledger would be very proud if he was around to see this. The best movie of the year! "
5272," Ledgers Joker on steroids
", Ledger was awesome for 30 mins of screen time but no way he could go on with why so serious and hold the screen alone for 2hrs+. One of the best performances in Hollywood history. 
5273," There are no words.
"," I just saw this movie in a sold out theatre, and there wasn't a single sound the entire time. When the credits started rolling and the lights went on, most people were still glued to their seats, still processing all the emotions this movie evokes. I understand and agree with the fact the movie could inspire people to do bad things. I think everyone who has ever suffered from any mental illness, myself included, can relate to Joker in one way or another. But even though some parts were relatable, you also feel repulsion and confusion that grow as Arthur slowly loses his mind. I watch a lot of movies and it has been a long time since I've felt so many things at the same time while looking at a screen. This is a masterpiece, and Joaquin deserves an oscar for his incredible performance. "
5274," My first 10 given to a movie
"," There are movies that have One element that stands out above the others and makes the movie wonderful, this is not the case because here all the elements work great and play according to Joaquin Phoenix, I have not yet found something that is not perfect in this film "
5275," Magnifecence
"," What a masterpiece , this movie will win the oscar as well ase joaquin "
5276," WOW just WOW!
", What did I just watch?! This movie was far above my expectations and could not say anything negative about this movie. Such a creepy story and well portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix! 
5277," I don't get the critics!
", I went to see this movies and came away thinking wow. 
5278," A great origin story.
"," I don't even know how to start with this review. I have so much to say I don't even know if there's enough space in a Letterboxd review.<br/><br/>Let's start off with the cinematography. It's great. The color palette is beautiful and there are lots of extremely good shots. And there are lots of great examples of visual storytelling.<br/><br/>The music is some of the best this gayest of not the best. It doesn't overweigh the scene or make it over-the-top. It perfectly fits the character and it's there when it needs to.<br/><br/>Now obviously don't need to say anything about Joaquin Phoenix. He has got this Oscar in the bag. He does such a good job it's genuinely uncomfortable when he's around other people because of his characters awkwardness. His laugh is mesmerizing and it looks like it actually hurts when he laughs, it actually looks like it hurts his throat when he laughs, like it's physically painful for him. I love that I think that's a great idea.<br/><br/>Now onto some things I didn't like. It feels like some scenes it doesn't commit to the realism the film establishes. ge. When he kills Randall and Gary is there it doesn't look like Gary is as shocked as a real person would In that position. They seem to treat it like a it's a PG-13 movie instead of an R-Rated one. A real person in that situation would probably have been completely in shock and silence and maybe wouldn't be able to say anything. A real person would see this as much more horrific then it actually is.
And it's the same thing in the last Talk-Show scene with Robert De. Niro as Murray Franklin. When Arthur tells people he killed those people and he laughs about it, Murray doesn't seem to react like a normal person would. And that goes for the audience too. Hey just ""booo"" at him and yell at him telling him to get out. I mean this is a child-friendly American Talk-Show and bodyguards don't take him out immediately? The audience doesn't get really confused and silent?<br/><br/>After thinking and talking about this movie with my friends. It may be that everything is something Arthur just imagined. All the people praising him, getting to be with that girl, killing his mom? All of this got me thinking maybe he never left the Psyciatric Hospital maybe he never left the white room. Maybe he sat in the room and made all this up. My point is, what i just mentioned before about the Talk-Show scene. If this was something he was making up. this is what he would probably think. "
5279," Everything is perfect
"," One the best movie I have seen so far , made for very special audiences, noobs are not recommended to see this movie else they will ruin its rating. "
5280," Film of the decade.
"," Outstanding performance by Phoenix, very disturbing and chilling. Incredible direction, loved the way it was shot, Todd Philips was an amazing surprise. The plot was so mesmerizing, you never knew what he was going to do next. Cinematography is impeccable. The score is absolutely haunting, i was at the edge of my seat every time it would come in, anxiously waiting for something bad to happen. Character development is on point, so many emotions felt during the length of the film. I can honestly say without exaggeration, and this means a lot to me because i love everything that Heath did with the character, this is my all-time favorite film. I will still keep both Heath and Phoenix in my favorite performance ever spot because it's two very different takes on the character and i loved them both in different ways. If the Oscars were actually what they're supposed to be, this film would take at least 6 home, but that's just my opinion. "
5281," Movie of the year
"," A tour de force of cinematography and acting. Joaquin Phoenix nailed his role, with subtle nuances throughout his devolution to the Clown Prince of Crime. The final 30mins is a true roller coaster ride of emotions and excitement. Wrote this review after my second viewing. Would not be surprised if I go for a third. "
5282," Insane, bold and beautiful
"," A remarkable performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The last time I saw someone get that into character was Heath Ledger's own take on said psychopath. Arthur Fleck, the Joker, is a complex character, he's not just insane. He's a troubled man who just wants to make people laugh but his job as an entertainer is merely a facade for his mental problems hidden under all the makeup. The way Arthur transforms into the Joker is frightening and disturbing but it's also mesmerising, you never know if he feels trapped or free in his true form. This is not to say that Joker's behaviour is acceptable or correct in any way, he's a sick man with a contorted view on life, but it's the product of years of abuse, mental illnesses and a ruthless society. Gotham, you reap what you sow. The Joker is not for everyone, there's no villain that needs to be stopped from taking over the world, nor is there a hero, but rather Joker is made to be open to interpretation. Whether he's the victim or culprit of all the chaos is up to you. "
5283," A Timely, Gripping Masterpiece
"," Possibly the most powerful film of the year so far, Joaquin Phoenix takes the audience down a dark tale full of relevant themes and boldly holds a mirror up to society, no matter how disquieted we feel, no matter how much we want to deny it, and no matter how much we want to turn away. Disturbingly bleak, yes. Horrifyingly unpalatable, yes. But perhaps what's most terrifying is the fact that it's the truth. "
5284," Applause.
"," It is very rare for people to applause after a movie ends (at least here in Hungary).
People did not applause after Endgame, nor after Blade Runner 2049, and not even after Inception a few years back.
After the last seconds of Joker however, I suddenly grabbed myself out of the absolute shock and ecstasy and adrenaline I was in, stood up and started clapping. People slowly started to froze up too and the theater went nuts for the first time in the town of Eger, Hungary.
I am positive similar reactions happened everywhere else in the world.
Joker is an absoultely outstanding masterpiece. "
5285," Unbelievable movie!
", The whole 2 hours kept me on the edge of my seat. It genuinely kept me moving just purely because of how disturbing yet mesmerising it was watching the incredible performance of jauquin phoenix. His performance was exceptional and definitely deserves an Oscar for how good his acting was in this film. It is for sure my favourite joker following heath ledger and his incredible performance. 
5286," Brilliante, surreal yet...REAL
"," At first i read so many times that this movie is about someone going nuts because of bullying. it thought, oh ok that's a popular topic. but then when i watched the movie myself i feel like this is far more, deeper, darker than just about bully. this is about ignorance. something that offers so much ambiguity and subjectivities. the internal conflict in joker is what makes this movie beautiful. phoenix acting? oh come on. there are characters about people with mental illness and when we watch it, yea we kinda get the idea that actor have given their best to interpret. but with Phoenix in joker, i spontaneously said ""omg he is sick"" like....he was not acting at all..like he is sick. i think if not because of age restrictions (which of course we need it) this movie will break so many records. can't wait for another joker appearance. bravo! "
5287," Amazing
"," Best film i've seen in a long while, Joaquin Phoenix put in his best performance yet! "
5288," ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN THIS YEAR
",
5289," The Next Level Of Comic Book Film
"," This movie is the definition of GRIPPING. From the first frame to the last, no thoughts entered my mind (an extreme rarity).<br/><br/>The directing by Todd Philips is masterful, the cinematography is breathtaking (Must See In IMAX {utilizes the full IMAX aspect ratio like Infinity War and Endgame}, the plot keeps you on your toes at ALL TIMES, but you're all waiting for the word on Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Easily, one of the Top 10 performances I've ever witnessed. He simply doesn't exist during this movie. He completely disappears as Arthur Fleck.<br/><br/>And yes, this film is very dark and disturbing. It is not the most grotesque film, but the way the disturbing elements are executed is shockingly surreal. You will want to take a moral shower after watching. "
5290," Did some critics even watch it?
"," Joker is a brilliantly constructed film. The character development of Arthur is something to behold and by the time the film ends, it is almost unbelievable that it is the same actor portraying the stories protagonist. I am shocked by the reviews of some of the critics who are supposed to be 'in the known' of what makes a movie a classic. It actually makes you wonder whether some of them even watched it... "
5291," The Joker we deserved
"," Joaquin Phoenix acting it's just perfect, the photography it's beautiful and suffocant.
It's a 2 hours trip through an ill mind, it's awkard and you want to get off the boat as the madness begins. "
5292," great great great
"," Great movie.. One of the best in the last 10 years. Well done.
The problems of today's society are perfectly presented and the consequences of that... Joker.
.. and Phoenix needs to get an Oscar for this role. "
5293," I haven't saw a movie so stunning in a long long time.
", Joker did not disappoint. I can't compare to other jokers because they're all amazing but I especially loved this this one. Joaquin Phoenix deserves the Oscar definitely. Go and see this movie. It's one of the best movies in a long long time. 
5294," JOKER is not the film we deserved but the film we needed.
",
5295," Beautiful
", This movie is by far one of the best movies released in a very long time. the cinematography is phenomenal and the acting from every character is Oscar worthy. this is definitely the best movie of 2019 and one of the best CBM. 
5296," Its a perfect film
"," This film is so perfect in every sense, starting with the performance of Joaquin Phoenix and ending with the performance of Robert de Niro. This movie is simply a 10. "
5297," one of the best movies ever
", This is probably the best psychodrama movie ever made.<br/><br/>Joaquin did really great to show the dark side of the joker in my opinion this is the best version of the joker even better than heath ledger's version. 
5298," Best movie since last four years!
"," Congratulations Oscar for Joaquin Phoenix!<br/><br/>The acting 10/10

5299," The reviews are real
"," There are not many films which come out now that are memorable or live up to their expectations, but I seen this film last night and I will be going to see it again, which I can not say I have done with many films before. It is unbelievable and quite possibly the greatest performance I ever seen. Probably the greatest Comic Book film adaptation yet. No spoilers here just go watch it and see for yourself. "
5300," Awesome Movie
", This is one if the best film in 2019. Outstanding acting performance for everybody especially joaquin. 
5301," JOKER IS A MASTER PIECE FOR THE TIMES
"," Todd Phillips just demonstrated how to do a great movie. Joaquin Phoenix was flawless and JOKER is definitely by far the best movie I have seen this year. Is so sad to see how disconnected from reality some ""critics "" are, they are the real JOKE. "
5302," Love phoenix :)
"," #Finally i have achieved
#watched joker in theater by taking off to office<br/><br/>-- This is the best movie in world class cinima
-- Phoenix nailed the joker character
-- until now we thought healthleger is the best actor in the world and no one can replace him, but Phoenix has changed this theory<br/><br/>Love Joker 2019 :) "
5303," Finally a different angle
"," Make no mistake the joker is not a happy film, when I watched it I was very tense because I went through the same struggle so you can understand why he is the way he is. It also brought a lot of the main story together of D.C I think the actor was perfect, it was directed perfectly and the film as a whole was genius will definitely go cinema to see it again. "
5304," That was Powerfull!
", I am beyond speechless with the way they have presented this iteration of Joker. Joaquin's performance is just out of this world. He has put in so much work especially to present the joker's laugh which is actually a condition called pseudobulbar affect. Do yourself a favor and please watch it. 
5305," Who said that this will cause trouble?
"," If people who think that the movie joker will encourage the crime rate, all of them have absoultely irrational logic. Not the movie but the theirs circumstance make them to do it. "
5306," Distrubingly Beautiful
"," With a gritt, graphic novel edge this protrail of the most famous villan of them all, The Joker sees you immersed in a film of a man disregard by society with a social climate on the edge of chaos. This depicts real life events that remind us of real struggle throughout the world.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix is on another level. His acting throughout the film is mostly filmed in solo scenes and to get that much emotion from yourself without anyone to work off is staggering.<br/><br/>Joker has it all... "
5307," MASTERPIECE üòç
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime. "
5308," Nobody stops to take a look
"," It's the confrontational realism of this film that might make you uncomfortable. A look into the mind of somebody who, like many others, is disregarded by society.<br/><br/>The dark ""80's New York"" style backdrop makes for a perfect scenery to Arthur's diary. The fast pace of society leaving less and less time to look at those who are most vulnerable. A misunderstood man who is on the verge of taking drastic measures. Would you scream if nobody seems to hear you?<br/><br/>A dizzying but amazing ride with an excellent portrayal by Joaquin Phoenix. Not your everyday ""happy bubble"" movie, but something much more... "
5309," A drama regarding society
"," A man's dream crushed by his peers.
A loveless creature waiting to be destroyed.
The obliteration of a mind and the rise of the anonymous. "
5310," This is my joker
"," Best movie i ever seen
That's what i want to see
Oscar oscar oscar "
5311," Absolute masterpiece
", I'm a superhero fan since I was child. I tought that Heath Ledger would have been the best Joker ever......I was wrong. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for his outstanding performance and the plot is very solid. One of the best movie I've ever seen. 
5312," Outstanding performance & nicely interpretation of Joker
"," I did heard many reviews from people's who already watched Joker screening, but I'm not ready to get caught what are Joachim Phoenix interpretation about Joker, since Heath Ledger's Joker, I doubt that somebody can perform as good as Heath, but I'm wrong...
Phoenix has different portrayal from Heath, different Joker, I like them both, yet crazy, psychopath... and adding of how fragile and desperate he is in Phoenix perspective...
This is the first time I gave 10/10 for the movie... The best movie of the year easily. "
5313," Amazing
"," Just amazing. I can't say anything. Just go to the cinema and watch this movie. If you aren't 18 too, you have to watch it. "
5314," Astonishing!
"," This movie takes on mental illness in a big way! Also spins the typical story of the elite stepping on the unfortunate and ignoring those hurt by society and the injustice of poverty. Excellent directing by Todd Phillips and an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, shot in a drab 80's style like Maniac or Taxi driver that would make Scorsese proud. Then wraps it all up with subtle touches of a familiar tale bent to the storyteller's take of the DC comic universe that should keep fanboys interested. A must see in my opinion. "
5315," Witness the magic of cinematography as it was always meant to be!
",
5316," Film of the years!!! Must watch!!!
", A movie I think a lot of people can relate to at times. More of a real life evolution into a villain unlike some of the past far fetched superhero/villain storylines. It has some great references to Batman and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Phoenix is amazing. Film of the year! 
5317," Send in, the clown
", Joker Review: 9/10<br/><br/>Joker is a dark take on a psychopath whom you might end up feeling heavy sympathy for during the film. That sympathy gradually turns into shock mixed with fear as it progresses. I'm a fan of Phoenix's portrayal. It's completely unique and his own. Joker is one of my favorite villains and I thought that this film did a great case study on him. Be warned it's not a kids movie. Joker is insane and you should be ready for a heavy handed drama. 
5318," Stunning acting. Harrowing story
", Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely superb in this film. I'm not exaggerating when I say this; it's the best acting I have ever seen. He adopts the character like I have never seen before.<br/><br/>The film is very dark and twisted and extremely clever. Quite a hard watch at times. The laughing is harrowing! 
5319," Ground Breaking Oscar Performance... A Must See Film
", The films is just a masterpiece. The joker has never been better performed ever. The storyline is well scripted and the acting was superb. The soundtracks are amazing. The psychological changes of the joker character is easily felt by the audience. Joaquin Phoenix performance is something to teach for generations to come of what acting career should be. It's an enjoyable film by all levels 
5320," And the oscar goes to...Joaquin Phoenix
"," I'm not going to tell much all i can say is, if Joaquin doesn't get every possible award for this performance something is wrong with the world. In my view 8 minute standing ovation is not enough it should have been 1 hour. "
5321," MASTERPIECE!
",
5322," A UNIQUE MASTERPIECE
"," I saw the movie on Wednesday and I can say that it was an immersive experience. It reflected the struggles of a loner suffering from mental health and the aftermath. It was a brave take by the director to use the character of Joker to potray a larger picture of the negatives of disregarding mental health and the negatives of a capitalist society. The movie had a extraordinary score by Hildur Gunatadior and the cinematography was beautifully shot
The costumes and make up reflcted the clowns nature and the performance of Joaquin Phoenix blowed me. I think he is a better joker than Heath Ledger as his character also showed human emotions. Other characters like Murray Franklin, Sophie Daramound, Thomas Wayne and Penny Fleck were used as important points in the plot. Overall the movie was once in a lifetime experience and I wish everyone in the world to see the movie to see the disturbing nature if disregarding mental health and the consequences "
5323," Masterpiece!
", Joaquin Phoenix's best performance I've seen. Absolute genius. Must watch. 
5324," I feel compelled to write my first online review
"," This is a special movie. I caught myself holding my breathe in the theater earlier tonight, leaning forward, flabbergasted, compelled. I've never been in a theater so quiet. No one around me stirred.<br/><br/>I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding this movie. Perhaps it's founded. But I felt moved in my soul, moved in the same way when confronted with truth; and I continue to feel a welling up of compassion and a dispelling of fear. It's shifted my perspective. Changed the way I view the world.<br/><br/>The pleasure is all mine Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix. Thank you for making art with integrity.<br/><br/>X "
5325," One perfect moment
"," I felt like it was created for a specific moment of truth. I was enthralled from the beginning as the movie just had this rawness to it. But this scene near the end the Joker speaks about using a man with a mental disability to entertain I felt like he was looking at us. We were in that moment just as guilty, we were entertained by his pain. In that moment the audience was no better than the audience in the scene, and it was just perfect it was meta without being meta, it spoke a raw truth and made me look at myself if just for a moment. It was an absolutely perfect moment and a perfect performance, thank you for showing me that movies like this are possible. "
5326," Instant classic.
"," One of the greatest movies I have ever seen, I have never seen a better portrayal of the slow decay of mental illness. There were so many scenes where I found myself laughing, nervous, scared, uncomfortable and sad all at the same time. Just watch it. "
5327," A Masterpiece in Psyche Exploration
"," I am absolutely blown away. In a world where comic book adaptations are watered down with corny jokes, cliche tropes, and overkill action with supernatural forces, this movie reinvigorates the genre. Something I've always wanted was a character development heavy focus for a hero/villain with touches of the indie drama genre mixed in, and boy, does this movie deliver. Of course, none of it would have been possible without the stellar performance by Joaquin Phoenix. I usually side with critics when it comes to the ratings of films, but with this one, I have to say the critics have no idea what they're talking about. "
5328," Comic Source Material as Art
",
5329," A true origin story from start to finish
",
5330," Best origin movie of all time!
", They say it will make you crazy. No the critics bias reviews makes the people crazy. It's a good movie! Maybe the best since the dark knight. 
5331," Hard not to say ""Wow!"" out loud in the theater!
"," Now I get the hype. There are two sides to this movie. Firstly, this feels like more than a film. It's an indictment of our ineffectiveness in addressing the mental illness in our society today. The dark places so many people are falling into with no lifeline to get out.
The other side is the incredible achievement of art. Rare is it today that Hollywood has flushed out the why and how of a character that we are placed right in the passenger seat of this speeding out of control vehicle of a film with no way to hit the brakes, and we don't want to. A front row seat to the building of madness and it's beautiful. The locations and production design are only topped by the cinematography. From the shot of a badly beaten Arthur to him emerging from a dark hall into the light of Day is breathtaking all the way to the end. A fantastic achievement that deserves all the accolades I'm sure it will garner. "
5332," Definitely not a comedy
"," The Joker. Where to begin. Maybe with the obvious...Joaquin Phoenix is terrific as everyone has heard. He puts so much emphasis on the psyche of the joker without it coming off too harsh. His performance is chilling to say the least and will definitely be getting some recognition.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips OMG. Where did this come from?? I really hope he moves more towards this genre as this thing is mastercraft. The thematic elements mainly the cinematography and score are superb. The stylistic choices make Gotham and the jokers world so dark and grim its impossible to take your eyes off.<br/><br/>This movie will definitely displease some people just because of the content, but when peeling back a layer it's a psychological thrill ride.<br/><br/>THE JOKER 10/10
SEE YOU AT THE OSCARS. "
5333," This is definitely an oscar movie!
"," Joaquin here presented a masterpiece with his marvelous performance. Depression, suffering, unfairness of life are all blended in this movie. This movie will be always remembered. "
5334," Deep. Dark. Epic.
"," Adrenalin and suspense from start to finish. Phoenix's Joker is a great adaptation of the original character and his origins, however, it's also a truly unique take on the character which makes that much more enjoyable. Going into this movie wanting to compare it to Heath Ledgers is just the wrong way to approach it. Ledger's greatness will never go away, but this film sets itself apart and you get a truly unique outlook on the character. Great acting, directing, writing, and cinematography. Epic! "
5335," It takes a master to paint a maniac as an effective protagonist
"," As someone that hasn't been a fan of many of the DC movies ( the Batman trilogy), I was surprised to see this movie quickly rising through the ranks on this site and others. Given the hype surrounding it, I went in with hesitant expectations, and was blown away. It has been written about already a multitude of times, but the lengthy exposition on each prominent character draws you into the movie in a unique way. Despite the mayhem and sociopathic tendencies of Arthur, you find yourself empathizing given his mistreatment. In addition to the drawn out character development, the musical direction plays a prominent role in pushing the story in a unique way- the score goes beyond the use of eerie ominous drones, and instead incorporates some of the background tunes on the Telly and Radio to invoke a deeper understanding for what the protagonist is feeling. "
5336," Wow
", It's hard to describe how good this movie was. I just know the sequel will be amazing. Can't wait. 
5337," Joaquin Phoenix delivers a masterful performance.
"," A character study, Joker is a dark, gritty, tragic and at times uncomfortable film to watch.If you appreciate films of the likes of Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange, American Psycho then I would recommend you definitely should watch this film. Great acting, score and cinematography. Ignore the pathetic media/critics and there scare mongering.Go watch the film and make up your own mind. "
5338," Masterpiece!
"," This is the movie of the decade! With a very small cast and almost zero effects, Phillips got me amazed and shocked! Phoenix is unbelievable! Give him the oscar now! Congrats everyone!! "
5339," Bodacious
"," WOW... just wow!<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect going into this movie knowing that the Phoenix had a big role to fill next to his counterpart, Ledger.<br/><br/>Phoenix pulled out all the stops. Such a great actor and amazing story. I was truly capture by the whole movie.<br/><br/>I will say it was a bit slow going, but the build up was well worth it.<br/><br/>I loved how they tied Gotham as a back drop but didn't make it all about the city. I loved the sprinkles of the Wayne family but didn't make it about them.<br/><br/>My only two grips with the movie is the music, I wish it was more ominous throughout and the ending. I didn't care how they showed him in Arkham. I felt they could have ended it with the scene right before. My opinion it had a better feeling when he was on top.<br/><br/>We all know Joker will end up in Arkham, but leaving him on top of his game with his followers would have more triumphant.<br/><br/>Just my opinions of the movie. Over all a huge 10 from me.<br/><br/>I can't wait for this to hit video so I can add it to my collection.<br/><br/>Must see for any fan. "

"," This is truly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen and I have seen quite a lot of movies. The thing about this movie is that it's artsy but not pretentious. It's a slow and thrilling dive into madness. Arthur Fleck slowly being swallowed by nothingness and emptiness while joker thrives in his stead. I read a review which gave the movie 1 out of 10 with the main reason being ""WHERE'S BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN??? Where is the heroes to stop joker?"" If you're asking these questions after the movie I'm suprised you can tie your own shoes or even open a door on your own. This movie is a standalone DC movie which I seriously believe benefitted the movie. This movie is a love letter to both DC fans and fans of Scorsese. I don't know if anyone could have pulled this of as fantastic as Joaquin Phoenix did. Fantastic movie, absolutely loved it. If i could give it 100000 out of 10 I would. "

5373," Is it JOKER ... or is societal commentary?
"," Wow. Excellent film. I watch anything with Joaquin Phoenix ... I've long thought he might be the best actor of our time.Which is why sitting through a film of his interpretation of Joker is one helluva hard slog. The story follows Arthur Fleck's descent mentally and his descent into becoming Joker. My heart broke continually, such is Phoenix' believable acting. The ending is very powerful and left me thinking this film is a commentary on the marginalized and misunderstood of our society. We see the shootings done by guys who snapped. These lonely forgotten folks are right in our midst and we've become such an indifferent human species ... not long before we really are full out chaos of Gotham. p.s. I don't think Phoenix cares if he gets an Oscar - that's just how he rolls. But he definitely deserves one for this performance. What a talent. "
5374," Brilliant!
"," Best movie to come out of the DCU. Who ever thought you would be rooting for the bad guy! Last time I watched a movie where I waa hoping the bad guys made it was Das Boot. Joaquin Phoenix is the new king as far as Jokers are concerned. Excellent acting and pace.<br/><br/>WB, don't mess up Birds of Prey by not linking the two together. I hope they reboot it starting with Joker. "
5375," Amazing!
"," Just as expected to be and what the trailer made it look like - an absolutly amazing journey to madness/freedom and personal power. Unpredictable second part of the movie but just wow! You will gasp, cover your mouth, laugh (not something I would have expected) and jump a lot! Joaquin is great (as always) and the role fits him like a glove. Obviously, I loved the movie :) "

A cinematic masterpiece that goes above and beyond everything they've done before.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is masterful.

I walked in with moderate expectations and left mindblown, the films performs perfectly as an origin story for one of the most infamous characters we've seen in entertainment and provides a dark, thought-provoking social commentary on loneliness and mental ilness, I've seen people comparing it to Taxi Driver and I can't help but agree that this movie carries a lot of Scorsese's masterpiece in it.<br/><br/>Loved it.

"
5387," Amazing origin story for The Clown Prince of Crime!
"," Coming from long time fan of Batman and an even bigger fan of the Joker this movie was exactly what we wanted. Joaquin Phoenix must be considered for one of the best Jokers of our time. He absolutely nailed the role with his infectious laugh, mannerisms, and more. It's a harsh realistic backstory to one of the greatest villains of all time. It's a very intense film having my fists clenched or my hands over my mouth most of the time. Todd Phillips delivered us a dark and gritty Joker movie that shouldn't have been portrayed any other way. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and deserves an Oscar Nom(Along with Joaquin's performance) The Crime Alley scene was a perfect setup and I was totally geeking out seeing not only the start of Joker's madness but also seeing the start of little Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman and knowing the path these two characters are on. This movie goes right up along The Dark Knight as far as I'm concerned. Amazing film "
5388," An DisneyLand E Ticket ride journey into madness and evil.
"," Actor Joaquin Phoenix plays the part of Arthur Fleck a down and out, mistreated insecure, needy misfit who suffers from acute childhood trauma and a neurological disorder that makes him laugh out loud maniacally in just about any setting for no reason whatsoever. Arthur has a job as a part time for hire party clown and he lives with his elderly physically and mentally disabled mother in a drab and dreary squalid inner city apartment complex as they both live a hand to mouth existence in a struggle to survive.
Then one day Arthur gets in trouble for accidentally taking a gun to a clown show at Children's hospital that he is performing at and as a result he gets unceremoniously fired from his job over the phone by his boss at the Clown show for hire company where Arthur is employed. It is on his way home late at night after getting fired from his job where Arthur is confronted and savagely beaten by three Alpha male wall Street trader goons on a subway car, that Arthur snaps and pulls a gun and savagely and mercilessly kills all three Alpha male Wall Street goons in cold blood. The worm has turned. At least in Arthur's mind it has as he goes from being a terribly mistreated, needy misfit and into a savage and blood thirsty sociopathic killer.
The confrontation that Arthur has with the three Alpha Male Wall Street goons on a subway car triggers a total transformation in his character and in his personality. He becomes hardened and vicious and discovers to his delight that he enjoys killing. He also discovers through a personal investigation of mental hospital records of his mother that he was savagely mistreated, abused and beaten by his mother's live in boyfriends when he was just a small child. So in retaliation for the horrible childhood trauma visited upon him by his mother and her boyfriend he goes to the hospital and suffocates his mother to death while she is being treated in the intensive care unit for a stroke.
This in turn sets off a murderous rampage by Arthur (the now transformed Joker) which in turn sets off class struggle protests and riots against the greedy Wall Street goons and the uber rich of society by the large collections of downtrodden masses as the city of Gotham is set ablaze as rioters loot and pillage the city.
What I find the most compelling about the plotline of this movie is the Joker's(Arthur Fleck) journey from being a downtrodden, needy misfit and into a evil maniacal killer that would rival for sheer evil some of the most infamous serial killers in history. The Joker goes from being a sniveling, little needy, coward into a viscous evil monster in almost the blink of an eye. His mind just basically snaps. This movie is a true journey into absolute madness and evil and it is, in a roundabout way, a case study of what makes some people snap and go crazy like what we have seen from some of the many mass shooters who have gone on recent mass shootings and killing sprees.
From the beginning this movie puts you on the edge of your seat with a hard core visceral edginess that makes you feel very uncomfortable and disgusted from about the first twenty or thirty minutes of the film. It is a Disneyland E-Ticket ride into evil and madness and into the journey of a man going off the reservation and losing his mind as he transforms himself from being a helpless, needy milquetoast and into a evil rogue killing machine reminiscent of other movie characters like the evil Colonel Kurtz in the movie ""Apocalypse Now"". It is an extremely violent film of a true visceral nature that will leave you wondering how could we as a society have gotten so selfish and so self centered as to have forgotten the least of among us like the downtrodden Arthur Flecks of the world. This movie I think reminds us that the Arthur Flecks, the Ted Bundys and the Charles Mansons of the world are human beings too and are indirectly in a roundabout way the creation of a society that has put a much higher value over the accumulation of wealth and income and material possessions over the needs of the country and the society as a whole.
You can feel absolute sorrow and pity for the Arthur Flecks, the Ted Bundys and the Charles Mansons of the world when they were helpless little children, but as adult monsters you just want to bring them to a very swift and decisive justice where they are made to pay and are punished for their evil and the crimes that they commit against society.
The Horror. The Horror. "
5389," Masterpiece
"," This movie was way better that I expected to be, this movie deserves a Oscar "
5390," This is something special
"," This is my first movie review, so this won't be the most polished review, but I'll try my best. I've got to say it again, this is something really special here. Joaquin Phoenix put so much into this performance, physically and mentally. His maniacal laugh even when the character is anxious seems like a very difficult action to balance body language between the laugh and the underlying emotion, and Joaquin walks that line perfectly. The twists this movie takes are slightly expected because of some instances in his life that seem too good to be true, but just the way that they are done is beautiful. They take those somewhat unbelievable circumstances and keep running with it, because Arthur believes it. And because Arthur truly believes it, you learn to accept it until that reality is completely undone and you're shown the true reality of his life. In other words, he's an incredible unreliable narrator for the story, to the point that I'd say he's honestly up there with Fight Club's unreliable narrator. Not only is this a beautiful origin story for Joker, it's an origin story for Gotham as we know it. In a way, this movie perfectly shows how the city is plunged into chaos, and it's all unintentionally thanks to Joker. Or maybe it was intentional. I may just have to go back and rewatch just to pick Arthur's brain more and truly understand how aware he was of what he was creating "
5391," Give Joaquin and Todd Their Oscar Already.
"," I have seen many superhero movies in my life and I have seen many actors play the Joker but never have I been so impressed with a performance and a film such as Joker. Joker was a film that not only brought the true origin story of how to supervillain known as Joker came to be as told in the comics, but it delivered the right amount of horror, action and drama/suspense that a perfect superhero movie should have. For a movie that is directed by Todd Philips, someone who I thought personally couldn't pull it off at first, he truly made a cinematic masterpiece that is worth all the Oscars and awards possible.<br/><br/>But of course, the real star of the film was Joaquin Phoenix. From the first look we got last year from Phillips on Instagram, we could already tell that he was going to be an good Joker but when you see the movie, he turned out to be an amazing Joker. Phoenix is right up there with Ledger as one of the best Joker actors and with all the Oscar buzz going around for Phoenix, I can see him getting all the Oscars for sure. no doubt. "
5392," One of the best Movie of 2019!! Must Watch
"," I am definitely sure that joaquin phoenix will take home an oscar award for this amazing portrayal of joker.. such a magnificent and clean performance, from start to finished i am amazed on how phoenix deliver such masterpiece. i really hope he will get to play more of joker in the future movies!!

My man stepped out of his normal genre and gave me one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. Joaquin's interpretation of a mentally ill man was was 100% believable and made you sympathize with the villain. Calling him a villain may even be an oversight. This movie was superb - check it out.

5407," Phoenix peaked.
"," This is without a doubt one of the best acting performances ever done, also one of the best character development presented throughout a movie, the pacing was constant, his behaviour was somehow justified. Critics complaining about the fact that apart from the main character and the lead's actor performance, the movie it's clumsy. Well, I'm not sure you read the title it says ""Joker"" not ""Joker's life in Gotham"" or ""socialist anarchy 101"".They focused on one character and they did an amazing job at doing so. I had huge expectations for this film and it delivered. "

5412," No Penguin, No Riddles, No Catwoman and definitely no Robin.
", Joaquin Phoenix deserves every oscar from 2009 til now...this is the Joker we've needed the entire rodeo. This movie may encourage behavior like Arthur's being how relatable it is esp with his trauma. I was truly sad Zazzie wasn't his friend. Delusional Joker...Robert Deniro was perfect. Movie is actually unreal. Can't wait to see a sequel. 
5413," WOW. What a performance.
"," Joaquin was asked and he delivered. Truly the best Joker since Heath Ledger. Worth the hype and then some. It was a masterpiece, no exaggeration. Made you forget that it was a ""comic book movie"". Something that has never been interpreted in this way before. He deserves an Oscar for this one. "
5414," Masterpiece.
", This movie isn't like the other super hero/villain movies. Because if you asked what was so good about some specific movies like Endgame people will go like I liked the fight scene where all the hero's appeared and etc. But this movie has no action yet the creators and the actors of this movie have made the movie so great and stunning. In my opinion people who don't like this movie either don't understand the content or they are marvel fans.

5420," I Was So Overwhelmed by Joaquin Phoenix's Awesome Performance, I Wanted a Cigarette and I Don't Smoke!
"," Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is absolutely great as a man society ignores and when people pay attention to him, they beat the living hell out of him! Arthur is a frustrated wanna be clown-comedian who has a neurological disorder that makes him laugh like crazy. I think the laughs cover the tears he cries. He is on 7 different meds and has to care for his bipolar mother, Penny (Frances Conway). I quote a little from ""Cellophane Man"" song from ""Chicago""- people walk by Arthur and look right through him like he isn't there. In a way, I thought of John C. Reilly putting on white pancake in ""Chicago"" when Arthur was putting his pancake on. Amos Hart and Arthu Fleck are ignored and mistreated by people and you can see their pain.
All of Arthur's frustrations come to a head when he and a woman are bullied by 3 drunk morons who work for Thomas Wayne, a wealthy man Penny worked for 30 years ago. These fools beat up Arthur on the subway and make fun of the clown costume he wears after he entertains sick kids at the hospital. Arthur shoots them with a gun he accidentally dropped at the hospital. Thomas Wayne is disturbed by the killings and wants to be mayor and clean up Gotham. Penny writes to him constantly about her and Arthur's living situation and writing about Arthur being Thomas's son. If so, the Joker and future Batman aka young Bruce Wayne are brothers.
Unfortunately for Arthur, Thomas tells him he is not his father and Penny was mentally ill and adopted Arthur as a little boy. Her boyfriend abused little Arthur. Arthur smothers his hospitalized mother with a pillow and that is when Arthur dies and he becomes the Joker.
In the middle of all this carnage, Arthur is invited to be on his idol Murray Franklin's (Robert Deniro) talk show only to be humiliated by the man. Murray shows his audience Arthur bombing out at a comedy show on a recording. Murray thinks the young man with the clown makeup will entertain everyone, but Arthur reveals what he did on the subway. He shoots Murray and takes off. There is anarchy on the streets of Gotham and the protesters in clown masks see the Joker as their leader.
This exciting, rather gory movie is really about the Joker with the creation of Batman as an afterthought. Joaquin really stretched his acting ability to the limit and his performance overwhelmed me to the point I wanted to smoke a cigarette to calm down! I called down without smoking but it takes a great actor to overwhelm people with a oerformance! "
5421," Masterpiece indeed!
"," Amazing acting, brilliant cinematography, beautiful story telling. I'm going back for the second time. Definitely worth my another $15. P. S. Joaquin definitely deserves his Oscar for this year. Wow! I'm still blown away!!! "

5425," This is how you build a character
"," Without repeating what everybody is talking about joker, I only can say that is a perfect construction (or deconstruction if you like) of a character. From the beginning you forgot that is based on a comic book character and begin to witnesses how a man can fall down down the rabbit hole... But as a batman fan you'll be amaze by the final act when everything start to make sense and the whole dark knight and his archenemy appears in front of you... Absolutely wonderfully. "
5426," Movie of the decade
"," After Heath Ledger's brilliant and deep performance of the Joker, I would not have thought that there was anything left in the character to be new or worth to explore. However, I was wrong. This totally new dark approach of the infamous comic book villain is perfectly fitting into today's careless society, where everybody just concern about themselves and the wealthy &amp; famous people shape the trends like ""what is good or bad"" or what is ""funny"", and thus what have ""value"" to make money from. Thank goodness, there are still - very few though - filmmakers who fight for creating artistic and deep movies which are original and have something to say and point out. The time has not yet come when movie studios budgeting only movies with Tom Holland's abs with poor plots and sloppy conversations. Please, make sure it will never.<br/><br/>This is truly a masterpiece, will be and should be a cult film. "
5427," If you think that the dark knight was DARK for a superhero movie, then please tell me about this one
"," This movie almost makes you forget that at the end of the day the joker is just a villain in a SUPERHERO world.
This movie is so dark, violent and super emotional in an artistic way. Best movie i've seen in quite a while.
No need to say more, make sure you watch it in theaters!! "
5428," You get what you deserve
"," When I heard that a joker movie was in the works and the guy that directed the hangover movies was in it I had my doubts but when Joaquin Phoenix was on board I knew that they would do a good job, what I didn't know was that it was going to be a masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal and I don't need to see any more performances this year nothing is going to top this one, his painful laugh, his eyes, his pain,his emotions, you feel it all in the best ways possible. Joaquin is often a scary joker but always a disturbing one. There's also good social commentary but not political. It's a must watch for film aficionados and it's more of a drama, it's a character study. Beautifully written and shot, dazzling cinematography, world class dialogue and brilliant performance. This film will put a smile on your face and also can make you cry and cringe and make you feel miserable, sometimes all at the same time just remember to put on a happy face. "
5429," A MASTERPIECE !!!
", In general i don't leave reviews; but this movie is such a masterpiece...that will touch your heart and emotions deeply.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix has always been one of my favorite actors; I am sure he'll take the Oscar as Best Actor.

", What a movie this a masterpiece üòçüòçüòçjoaquin Phoenix give us a brilliant performance 
5431," A case of "" Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life""
"," In a movie that showcases how society giggles and laughs at the misfortune of those they view lesser...<br/><br/>In all honesty, I'm at a loss of words so I'll just describe what happened at the theatre today:<br/><br/>In the scene where Arthur kills Randal and Gary attempts to run away to the corner. As soon as the camera cuts to Gary the entire theatre burst laughing.
At first, I thought I had missed something funny that happened. But as the camera went back and forth between Arthur's stabbing of Randal and Gary's look of fear, the laughter just kept getting louder and I was just baffled.
Yes, the scene might have taken a comedic turn towards the end. But those first few seconds of Gary's fear couldn't have even warranted a smirk.<br/><br/>This movie, although depicting a fictional character, it exemplified the sick, sad state of the world we live in. "
5432," Speachless
"," A movie where the ones who don't understand it, the only thing they can do is just ... laugh. "
5433," Joaquin Phoenix Oscar worthy performance
"," Wow. This movie astonished me! Mind boggling performance, Joaquin Phoenix delievers a completely original, unsetling, crazy Joker, brilliant direction, narrative, cinematography, SCORE, sound, and also Robert DeNiro whit a smaller part, but a nailed it one (waiting to see him in the IrishMan!!)
This movie trully is about the Joker origin, so dont expect to see him as a trully Joker in the first 10minutes. The movie slowly builds itself to the masterpiece you will see and rewatch again and again in the future. I think no one could have done a better Joker movie. I just love it! Thanks "
5434," Joker is epic and more
"," Just got back from the IMAX screening of Joker and I'm still left speechless. I can only say that Joaquin Phoenix' performance is the best I have ever seen in a movie. He was already the greatest actor for me before Joker but in Joker he only confirms it that no actor comes close to his greatness. How can they not hand him the oscar for such a great performance? This movie grabbed me from the first until the last minute. Not only did I love Joaquin Phoenix, I loved everything about this movie like the storyline, the cinematography and also very important the score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir. She's really an awesome composer and in a dark way, at least for Joker. Alright, my only complain is the fact that the movie is actually too short at 2 hours. I wanted at least 30 minutes more but at least I'm seeing the movie tomorrow again in Dolby Digital. I want to thank Todd Phillips for casting Joaquin Phoenx in this movie and giving us one of the greatest movie ever! "
5435," One of the best Psychological Thriller movies & breathtaking performance.

5436," Joker review ( p.s.: i just watched a few hours ago )
"," This was my first movie, where i mainly focused on the actor's mimics, emotions while watching. And OMG Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant . The ""character development"" of Arthur (or Joker) is incredible, i mean it was a full new experiment to watch. The story was on the point, finally a movie what isn't just about Joker's criminals. The enviroinment and the atmosphere of the movie is so good, the sounds are perfectly fit in the movie. The references from the comic books were a little bit disappointing to me, but it's give me hope about a continuation of this story... I say give Phoenix an Oscar, he deserves it based on this acting. "
5437," They pushed the envelope till there wasn't one
"," Joker is bold, unapologetic, raw, bleak, violent, riveting, psychotic. It's everything it promises to be and much more. This is Joaquin's movie, man delivers a performance that will make the best ones squirm, the command on his body and the screen? 10/10<br/><br/>It makes you feel for the character and kinda think his actions are justified, but then you question your own morals. The best ones do..<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for everyone, especially if you want a feel good high-five flick go watch one that begins with a red rectangle box.<br/><br/>Joker will be discussed for ages to come, cannot believe they pulled it off in a comic book movie of all genres, that too with the Hangover guy making it!<br/><br/>Must watch with a crowd. "
5438," No wonder why it's received awards.
"," Honestly, I didn't expect much since I had seen reviews saying that Joker was so dark. And that's not my favourite movies' material. Nevertheless, I can't take my eyes of the screen for the whole film. Whenever I thought, ""This is it, it can't be much worse, this is the peek that Joker finally show up"", it was not. It just went deeper and darker, as there were times I almost bursted out in tears. Joaquin Phoenix played his role so excellent that I even thought whether his mental state was okay. Besides, the film was beautifully made. Mostly, every scene looks like a piece of art. The way Gotham itself expressed its madness makes me feel kinda... empathetic with Joker. There is so much to say about this film, but I guess I will leave it to my rating then. The best film I have seen for a long while. "
5439," Go witness a Masterpiece!!
"," Goddamn what did I just see. This movie is got to be one of the best movie of the year. Joaquin Phoenix carried this movie on his shoulders. A character study of the most twisted villain,Movie perfectly depicts how a person whose life was filled with isolation, loneliness and misery paves the way to the villain he has become. Even if you are not a joker fan give this one a try. "
5440," I just witnessed a historic movie
", Joker movie easily one of the best movies of all time 
5441," Exactly what you expect from Joker
"," I admit, I was skeptical of this movie before going for the premier show. It was a great experience, the acting, direction and story was perfectly executed. Through out the movie you feel the emotions as intended by director and actor. the only reason I am giving 8/10 is because I am comparing with TDK, this movie is excellent of rone time theater experience but not something I would like to see multiple times at home like the former one. "
5442," Freaking Amazing
"," I have no words to describe this movie. The movie was unexpected (the storyline is interesting), and of course the actors are amazing.
To be honest, I had so much going on in my head while watching this but mostly amazed by the acting. Truly remarkable!
Worth to watch ! "
5443," A must watch, atleast to be Happy
"," Joaquin Phoenix has done a brilliant job in the movie and you get carried away with this character, his philosophy so much so that you think he is right everytime. That's when you have impressed as an actor. Was truly lucky to catch this one in the theatres. "
5444," One shot that is all it takes
", Great finally they succeeded in properly filming a comic character ... Almost No references to the comics. almost no story line from the comics. but a wonderfully new fresh start. Loved it from beginning to the end. It is a good character building story of the Joker! And let's not forget great filming the tension the disappointment you can all feel it in the great acting üé≠ 
5445," Super acting of joker

"," Joker<br/><br/>Movie is great, If you like dramas. If you want action only it might dissappoint you a little bit.
I'm excited of next movie might be batman or Gotham. Joker 2... This movie show you how it all started. Not just from hero part but from how a villian born. "
5448," THE LEGACY OF JOKER CONTINUED AFTER HEATH LEDGER !!!!!
", For a person who loves or knows the character of joker this is a must go movie. This movie gives the best backstory of joker. The story of batman in the movie differs a little than the original story of the batman and the death of his family.But the way the joker emerges from his sufferings and the painful incidents happened with him in the society makes the film a masterpiece.And i dont have any words to describe the acting of joaquin phoenix. 
5449," Emerald
"," It ain't diamond that glitters, nor is it a pure white pearl.

5458," An unbelievably thought provoking film.
"," I finished watching the movie about 2 hours ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I left the theatre wanting to see more! The acting and story was incredible.<br/><br/>However, if you going into this movie expecting a Comic book action flick. This ain't it. This is a character study. A brilliantly portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime by Joaquin Phoenix. Todd Phillips did an amazing job! "
5459," Crazy Flick with Outstanding Acting
"," I can't say much about the weight of the storyline. But... Phoenix came out with some magnificent piece of acting. Heath Ledger must've been super proud of his successors work.
A must watch for all the Joker fans around the world.
P.S. Background score was equally superb. "
5460," Dark, Disturbing, Impactful and Stunning
"," What an amazing experience. As everybody is already saying Joaquin Phoenix is incredible. There are few scenes where you feel him staring right into your own soul.You feel the pain, the misery, the struggle and the grief. His laughs makes you laugh in a very heart breaking-ly way. A very dark, dramatic and devastating portrayal of mental health issues. I have not seen such an amazing movie in a long time. Thank You makers. And Thank you Phoenix. "

-A Dark And Funny Story
-Excellent Cinematography
-Haunting &amp; Chilling Score
-Joaquin Phoenix Spectacular Performance
-Great Supporting Cast
-Full of Plot Twist
-Brutal Violence and Profanity<br/><br/>Overall i would say this is a absolute definitive original film. Its a must watch for every CB guys out there if its Marvel Or DC.Watch it in IMAX. Out of 10 I'm giving 10/10.Its a Masterpiece "
5462," Masterful acting and direction
"," I enjoyed every bit of this movie, be it Joaquin Phoenix acting or Todd Phillips direction or Hildue Music or Cinematography.<br/><br/>Its Phoenix in every shot flowing.Its pleasure to watch him, he was extraordinary. "
5463," Best joker
", The actors the direct the joker the movie the soundtrack the Gotham city all of this is amazing things 
5464," Uneasy to the heart and puzzling to the brain
", The Joker movie is probably one of the darkest and most disturbing movies so far. It rails up the emotions of the viewers with awkward and uneasy scenes. It's also definitely one of the best movies of the year. Joaquin Phoenix's performance grips you in to the story believing that all of it was real. Joaquin has with no doubt presented one of the best and darkest joker adoption to be seen on the big screen. 
5465," First review
", This is the first time I am reviewing anything on IMDB. I watched this movie yesterday. This has to be the best movie ever made. I have never watched a movie as fascinating as this. I don't have enough words to express my feelings. 
5466," Oscar is booked now....
", Simply amazing.....how well this movies has potrayed the origin story. The killing joker origin story has no compare to this. And in the age of cgi and other unworldy stuffs...there is a masterpiece with real and genuine. Joaquin has single handedly managed to spend 2 hours on screen. BEAUTIFUL ACTING.....AWESOME 
5467," Put on a Happy Face!
"," Where Dark Knight illustrates Batman's view on society, this is the view of Joker. Through him, we see the dark, the oppressed, ones that never stood a chance whether in Dark Knight, we saw the bright side of the road. Joker isn't the vigilante, he is the part of the society that was never given a luck. He is the part of us where we leave in the dark and in the dark moments, he wakes up. Hysterical isn't it? He isn't the villian but not the hero as well.
Joaquin Phoenix never disappointed me with his performances though he cannot compete with Ledger. Shots were superb, but the movie lacked the conversations. Joker in this movie, doesn't talk as much as he talked in Dark Knight.
But all in all, movie underlies the important issues of the society and gives us a clear look on what we're missing. It's filled with smart details and deep meanings. Bravo!!! "
5468," Breathtaking masterpiece
"," A mind bogging movie delivering over its promise on literally all points:
1. Robust, heart wrenching story that blows your understanding of the Joker and Batman characters and beginnings.
2. Just perfect performance from Joaquin Pheonix.
3. Attacking so many soul wrenching themes like poverty, mental illness, discrimination, child abuse, sexual abuse. Even Jay Leno type characters take a beating.<br/><br/>At least 2 Oscars. "
5469," Most terryfying movie of a decade
"," This is no normal horror, I would classify it as a psychologically-social horror.
The scary thing is not a alien clown or murderer with a knife but an incredible feel of reality, especially with Hong Kong protests and the boring dystopia we live in.
If you ever wanted to be horrified of yourself and the community you live in, go see this movie. Because WE ALL LIVE IN A SOCIETY "
5470," Best DC movie after dark knight
"," This is not a super hero movie like you would expect.It's unique, joaquin carries the whole movie and he gave a spectacular performance. "
5471," Mentally good
"," When i came out of the cinema i was very suprised by how good the movie really was you really think this guy is the joker he did a perfect resemblance of how joker should be , his acting was just phenomenal .in my opinion the movie is timed perfectly it should not be any longer or shorter . "
5472," spoiler less
"," The most realistic origins for superhero/villain that ever made. Its not like killing joke in comic or the animted movie, but this is something diffrent. You will believe that joker's origin is really really exist because this movie.<br/><br/>the plot, the story, the emotion, the cast especially JOAQUIN PHEONIX is the best in this film. oscar deserve him. IF joaquin phoenix not getting oscar for this role THEN it will be shame. He deserve it<br/><br/>DC fanboy wherever you are. you've been waiting so long for DC comeback again, i tell you, THIS FILM nail it perfectly<br/><br/>SJcontroversy never talk about how this film is good/not. They just think this film probably will make controversy and etc. BUT they never tell about the essence of this film are. they just lead the opinion that this film can bring people make violent. SCREW YOU. if we have discuss it fair, you can critics this film BUT still have discuss about the essence about this film or is it good/bad film. pls be fair<br/><br/>thanks for joaquin pheonix and tod phillips for made MASTERPIECE film
WELCOME BACK DC and WB "
5473," A masterpiece which can't be missed at any cost.ü§°ü§°
"," Today morning I went to watch this without having my breakfast but this movie vanished my hunger. I used to think no one can be better than Heath ledger but pheonix proved me wrong and went above Heath in my list. 1st half keeps going good but will not bore you but 2nd half takes excellent pace and made who clap and whistle hard.
My favourite scene:-
Arthur:- What's your name?
Kid:- I'm Bruce.
Audience üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè. "
5474," A must watch. The movie is a masterpiece in every single way and should not be missed in my honest opinion
"," Just watched it today as it released 2 days early in my country. This movie is jaw dropping. Probably the best from this year and one of the best movies for me. Joaquin's acting definitely deserves an oscar this time. Throughout the movie I wanted to be sympathetic for a cold blooded killer but at the same time was never able to forgive him for his actions. The movie had me on edge for the whole two hours, I'm still amazed how perfect the acting was, Heath must have been proud.
I'm honestly at loss of words on how to express my emotions, but in all honesty all I would say is that it's a must watch doesn't matter if you don't enjoy super hero genre, this is a very dark take on the society and how grey the world is where anything can happen. "
5475," You wouldn't dare look away from Joaquin Phoenix.
",
5476," Main character - society, Arthur - a result of that society plus terrifying and dramatic story equals excellent movie.
"," When first trailer came out, I believed that movie will be awesome and not that I was right but the movie is over the top. Seriously, like Todd Phillips who made ""The Hangover"" which is a comedy film, making an opposite genre movie like ""Joker"" is very impressive. I really love that author made this movie the way he see it. It doesn't bother him all ""tolerance"", he don't afraid to put in his movie cruelty in all ways, and it's not about killing but oppression by society, pushing so hard that convince someone to do what normally not suppose to happen and the way it looks, it's actually scary. Also it's not just story about villain, it's a message that no metter if person sick or different, he still part of our community and must be judged like ""normal"" human. So, in conclusion ""Joker"" - is masterpiece. You need to see it, other way you won't understand it. "
5477," FAKE LOL !
"," That is promising movie ! tragic, chaotic, pathetic but this is what all we need.<br/><br/>Story is slowly flowing at the start until middle, maybe telling to us how to manage our mentality and fight against it.<br/><br/>And the biggest part is when Arthur reclaim himself to JOKER, i was laughed same as him, i dont know why, maybe i know what the Arthur feeling like, thats amazing manage our feeling.<br/><br/>Good Job. "
5478," COMPLETE TRANFORMATION MOVIE
"," If youre goin' to watch this film don't expect stunt scenes like heath's in dark knight rises this is typical transformation of a man called Arthur fleck to very dangerous serial killer based on gotham city.Joaquin Phoenix's acting is completely differemt from heath ledger's don't compare them.For many people there's some difficulty to accept joaquin's joker as they are used with heath's.But trust me after watching this movie you may change your mind.As joaquin is absolutely astronishing and very dedicated (refer his acting scenes in THE MASTER,HER etc..).This movie deals with joker's story and they presented it nicely with some twists and batman references.MUST WATCH MOVIE FOR BOTH DC/MARVEL FANS. "
5479," River Phoenix smiling from heaven.
"," For a mentally unstable character's origin story, Joaquin Phoenix took the character to a next level. Here's looking at you Heath Ledger. A subtle homage to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King Of Comedy'. It's Philips' masterpiece and an acting masterclass. If it doesn't deserve an Oscar nod I don't know what does.
The scenes where Phoenix embraces his pain turning into THE Joker sent chills to my spine. A. River will be smiling from upstairs. "
5480," Best movie and acting by miles in a long long time
"," Simply mesmerized by Joaquin Pheonix and his acting in this movie.
It's a dark movie so so well done it can attain cult status for Joaquim as well as the character Joker.<br/><br/>It's a 10/10 from my side. "

"," Beautiful. The story, Cinematography &amp; most likely Joaquin acting. Stunning at the end! "
5482," WOW!
",
5483," Greatest movie ever..
"," This movie is a good description of a Joker. The true manner a joker is ever made is described in the movie...
It is an understatement to say it is a great movie that encircles the realities under which a man in sculpted into a murderer who finds killing people funny enough to say that his life is a comedy because he kills people who make fun of him and laughs at the petty deaths of the same people that are killed by his gunshots!!!!! "
5484," Believe the hype.. Its a masterpiece!
"," I was all worried about the hype around this cuz i thought it will feel underwhelming when i will actually saw it.. But god i was wrong... It is a MASTERPIECE.
its a slow burner but boy it exploded like a bomb at the end.. If it does not end up with with both the best picture and best actor at the academy than i dont know what will...its going to have a cult following in the times to come... Joquin phoenix you are a star.
People dont miss it..watch it in theatres..you are gonna remember it for all the good reasons. "

The humiliation he face in the opening scene
, the dance and of course the cold blooded murders that joker does is not that easy to get out from your mind
The supporting cast Robert de niro and zazie beetz were wonderful to watch.
At the end of the movie you definitely say joaquin phoenix deserves Oscar "
5491," A classic made from a comic book character
"," I went to the October 2nd screening with much expectations and Joker delivered that and more. I cried 3 minutes into the movie. The climax is one of the best yet on a superhero/villain movie. To be honest, the last 15 minutes of the movie is pure masterpiece. The story of this film is a really gripping one. The direction adds more to it. I was on my feet at the end of the movie. Joaquin deserves two oscars for his acting skills during his ""condition"" laughs. Hands down amazing, just amazing. Todd philips is a really talented director. The movie had many amazing camera shots. I really loved it and I definitely seeing it again. "
5492," Don't miss it else you will regret !!!
"," The first of half of the movie is well built that fills you with smile,anger &amp; sadness and the second half is all about madness !!! Joaquin Phoenix delivers an outstanding performance from the very first frame of the movie .....He definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance as Joker !!! Man Do yourself a favour and watch this Masterpiece !!!! "
5493," Joke on all of us and we probably dont get it.
"," Joaquin Phoenix is great in this Joker characterization. You'll going to sympathize with him initially, he is a man who is beaten by society and also society don't notice him. He wants to be a famous comedian but has a medical condition of not stop laughing. He really wants to be a good man in this deranged gotham city but his inner demon is far powerful. He finds killing people a great feeling and liberating. He killed people who wronged him.
Joker is a story of a psychopath who kills 'awful' people. It is a great character study of a mentally-ill man who wants to shape world in his own view. By committing murder society started to see him, he became famous. Acting, cinematography and soundtrack is one of the factor of this movie. "
5494," A well made disaster of a movie
"," A biopic about a homicidal sociopath. An insightful movie that dives into mental illness and glorifies mentally disturbed homicidal maniacs. Not sure it has any redeemable quality other than to help us understand the depravity of a mentally ill homicidal lunatic. A trophy movie for the future shooter. Great job Hollywood, not. Why is this rated highly? It is disturbing. Almost walked out. "
5495," Worse
"," Ok, I got your attention, I just say it's was a amazing movie, wow !!! The best performance actor!!!! Hurry up and watch the movie!!! "
5496," Overrated but good
", This is a good movie. Does not live up to the hype. Really Justice league is better. This has an okay story line. It also has great acting. It is kind of scary. A mush better movie then some. But not a 10 out 10. More like a 6. 
5497," The most boring movie of the year
"," Joker is a joke, a very bad joke and not funny. We find ourselves with a film in which scenes are repeated ceaselessly in slow motion to make clear something that is known from the first minute, the protagonist is an unhappy, idiot and mentally ill who lives with his mother.<br/><br/>In a Gotham that has nothing of Gotham, it is rather the New York of gang members of ""The Warriors"", with a Joker that has nothing of the authentic Joker they try to sell us a movie that only stands out in boredom and predictability.<br/><br/>When I came out of the cinema everyone said that the film was very bad, several fell asleep during the screening. I don't know where they get that it's a great film. Such a mystery.<br/><br/>For me, the worst movie of the year. "
5498," Psychopath
"," The story is boring there is no action or horror scenes and does not contain an important message
The movie is so badü§¢ "
5499," A Sycopath Joker!!
"," I feel the Trailer Cheated us, catching the audience Coming to the theatres with lot of expectations.But from the beginning the movie story line is weaker when compared to a stronger character like Joker Himself.The second half is incompareably weak as well.I wish I could have avoid this dark outrage, cruel Emotional Drama Movie which gives only message to the audience Fear Joker. "
5500," The Dark Knight fans are likely to be disappointed
"," This movie had very good visuals and acting, but lacked a good convincing story. There wasn't much of a justification for his joker-type brutality, nor mesmerizing unpredictability of old joker. All the brilliance of joker in dark knight was completely missing, what we instead got was a sad little psychopath. This is not a bad movie overall, just nowhere near what as a dark knight fan I hoped it to be. "
5501," Oscar material
", Being a great fan of comic book movies and origin films/TV series I had great hopes for this film.<br/><br/>However I spent most of my time looking at my watch and hoping the pace would improve. Sadly it only got interesting in the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>A guaranteed Oscar winner 
5502," Heath Ledger remains the epitome, Phoenix is brilliant in Tod Phillips confines not in the Jokers
"," The issue remains forced. The darkness unconvincing. The noir effect tries to push you over the edge, but it never really gives the goosebumps. A good try, but well short of the mark. "
5503," Redundant
",
5504," Great acting, great ending but poor storyline
"," The great reviews on here are well founded but personally I thought that Heath Ledger was a better joker. Here are the Pros &amp; Cons of the movie: -<br/><br/>Pros
-Great Acting
-Great Ending
-Story was gritty<br/><br/>Cons
-Story was long winded and boring in parts<br/><br/>-The joker is a criminal mastermind &amp; planner, this version of the Joker couldn't plan anything.<br/><br/>-The twist has already been done in other movies e.g. A Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>-He doesn't have scars on his face and it isn't addressed anywhere in the movie. "
5505," It's ok, but it's still a comic-book story
"," The story could have been much tighter. Well acted, nicely filmed. But ultimately not strong enough to be what it wanted to be. "
5506," A few stumbles away from being great.
"," Joker is a better movie then I thought it would be. With an outstanding performance from Phoenix, good cinematography, editing, color composition this movie will definitely please average movie goers. The faults come from a sloppy love plot and an unclear direction and message that is missed. These faults however should not distract form how good the movie is. Some will call it a masterpiece, and though that title is undeserved I won't argue if people call it great. "
5507," hyped but still good
", Joker was a good film but i think the hype surrounds it makes the expectations more and in the final summary it is just a good movie nothing more! 
5508," Overhyped.
"," This is the most boring movie I've ever seen in a movie theatre. Not a whole lot of story or plot. Phoenix's performance was good, dont think this would be winning any Oscar's though. This is just a movie of Phoenix laughing and smoking for 2 hours. The hangover director does it again, another snooze fest. Save your money and watch it online. "
5509," Overrated and heath ledger is a million times better
"," This movie is an all round good movie, the acting is a solid 9/10 the story is 8/10 but nothing really happened in the movie, which drops the rating down, there was a reference to Bruce Wayne and heath ledgers joker I believe, by smearing blood in that smiley face which reminded me of heath ledger. Overall a good movie and not too mention the movie is very slow paced and the first half was pretty boring "
5510," Masterpiece
"," Joaquin Phoenix is a masterpiece! I haven't seen this film yet, but he's just a massive actor! "
5511," Meh.
", Maybe it's just not my thing but I found the whole film boring. Performances were great through. 
5512," Disgusting promotion for violence
"," There is one thing ""positively"" to be said about this movie, it is that Phoenix is a great actor. And that's all. The movie is a pure commercial for the use of violence. It is disgusting, but at the same it shows us what America is all about. Gun violence from the right, protest violence from the left, America is going down and Hollywood is leading. Before I walked out of this movie half way, already over 20 people left "
5513," Highly overrated
"," Acting of Joaquin phoenix is awesome. Direction is par excellence, but storyline has no punch. Also please don't compare it with batman, you would surely get disappointed.. "
5514," really well made but not very entertaining
"," This movie is of the highest quality. directing and cinematography are great. the acting job by phoenix is phenomenal. the tone of the movie is palpable. this kind of realism in a comic book movie reminds of of the dark knight trilogy. (1 viewing 10/9/19)<br/><br/>(MILD SPOILERS)<br/><br/>having said all that, this movie is very slow and lacking in entertainment value. just to be clear, i'm not saying it has to be fun or funny like typical comic book movies. but how about some suspense??? some intrigue??? a story that captures you??? this entire movie is about a character and what happens to him, as opposed to a movie about a story with a character in it.<br/><br/>as an example i will compare it to batman begins, which is the origin story of batman. while being an origin story, the movie didn't only focus on the character of bruce wayne and what turned him into batman. that was just one aspect as part of a much bigger overall story. with a villain, with stakes, with intrigue, where you cannot wait to see what happens next. i didn't feel that here.<br/><br/>if this entire movie was shortened and the pace was increased, and was turned into the first half of a movie with a bigger story, i think it could have been amazing. it doesn't have to be action, doesn't even have to have a villain. but maybe a scheme or some kind of demented social experiment to further illustrate who he has become. but who knows, maybe they wanted to avoid the traditional origin story route "
5515," Way over rated, too hyped
"," The acting was okay , however the story line was horrible. To be honest way over rated didn't meet up to my expectation. "
5516," Not Enough Joker
"," I think Joker is a great movie, but it wasn't (at least, not for me) a satisfying Joker experience. I wanted more Joker. I mean, they could've named it The Sad Clown or something like that and it wouldn't have lost much. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the movie, I think it's great. But I just wanted more Joker and less Arthur Fleck. "
5517," Quite entertaining, good film, slightly boring
"," Yeah it's ok, no Dark Knight though. Probably could've been 100 minutes rather than 120. "
5518," It was okay
"," Joker is a weird one. On one hand it is the most interesting of DC's output for 10 years and is the first film of theirs that I've seen in the theatre since 2012. It's a performance driven character study and stands in a different league of film to the DCEU and MCU. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as Arthur Fleck and the supporting cast are great too. It has a distinct and thoughtful visual style, and the score perfectly bolsters every moment.<br/><br/>But that's the thing. All of these amazing elements elevate a thematically muddled film. Its ideas are thought provoking but don't draw any meaningful conclusions. With any other comic book film I would consider this more profound, maybe that's an issue with me, but I feel when you ""sit at the big boy table"" so to speak, you invite a deeper level of criticism. This film is getting awards buzz, and I think some of that may be warranted, but I think the screenplay maybe could have done with another draft. "
5519," The best Joker performance ever!
"," Joaquin Phoenix, what can I say more this incredible actor did an extraordinary acting that imo beats heth ledger's performance in the Batman : The dark night, "
5520," What an act
"," By far the most incredible mesmerizing and beautiful act I have ever seen, Mental illness movies are usually the same or predictable but this one is way different! Great acting and one of a time, People started clapping when the movie ended in Saudi arabia cinema "
5521," Loved it!
"," It's just so realistic, Joaquin Phoenix really did a great job! Hope there will be a second one! I would totally watch it again. "
5522," Hype is real.
"," If you want to look at becoming one of the most memorable characters in DC comics, then this movie is clearly for you. If you want to see how much society can be toxic, then this film is for you. If you want to see a film that is completely replete with tolerance and where all the sins of society are shown, then this film is for you. If you are a normal person who understands that cruelty in people does not appear from scratch, then this film is for you. This film is beautiful in everything. "
5523," Joker
", Major spoilers ahead<br/><br/>You've been warned<br/><br/>So this is probably the best movie I've seen the whole year let's start off with Phoenix who brilliantly played Joker in his own way and is really good at playing a crazy person and that laugh that he had was great overall he was a really good Joker had a whole different look and everything the story overall was thrilling and full of twists and turns and suprises and makes you question your sanity to what's real and not to and has a good decent amount of stuff to be a R rated movie like how he stabbed somebody with scissors or when he shot Robert de Niro in the face overall the movie was well acted written and surprisingly well directed for somebody who directs movies like the Hangover I could go as far as to say Joaquins Joker is on par with Heath Ledger and just on par with the Dark Knight overall this movie is a high recommend to any moviegoers and hell of one to watch 
5524," Phoenix's depth is Daniel Day Lewis-esque
", Saw joker the other night. Oscar nods coming their way for sure. Phoenix was born for the role (and I don't mean the joker). Perniciousness at its finest. But the acting is superb. Morbidity glorified like the cooper Gaga movie last year. But Phoenix is great at transporting you (which to me is a the best quality you can achieve in a movie) into a world that ordinary people just can't replicate. The power of movies really. 
5525," Best of the best
"," Every time I see name of one of favorite Actress ""Joaquin Phoenix"" I know I will watch on Unforgivable move and this one it's
Thank you very very much to bring on of my favorite character to Stage again ""Joker""
You will be my hero Ever and Ever "
5526," Loved this film showing how Joker came about
"," No previous films showed how joker came about and this film did exactly that, almost like a perfect prequel to batman. Minimal knowledge of batman films required. Watch it and enjoy! "
5527," SUPERB
", This is my second time writing a review here. First being Ratatouille. It's been over 10 years since I last felt so deeply emotional watching a movie. The acting was just superb. It's so painful to watch Arthur. It's so relatable in many levels. This movie deserves the 10 and all the recognition. 
5528," Joker, as it meant to be
"," I saw it and I don't think it's going to happen for two actors to take the Oscar for the same Joker. Sorry for this. Phoenix is fantastic, not that I'm dying for him, he succeeded a character who doesn't emulate any kind of empathy or sympathy, at least not in me, though the public can figure out the mechanisms that made him a monster. Ledger felt good in Joker's skin and made him likeable, while Phoenix is a Joker whom he hates and identifies with his own hatred, creating a self-destructive sociopath. Hmm, will this be the sociopath who deliberately wants his own evil? The film went beyond the filming of comics and entertainment, not much left to entertain, it makes us think and creates controversy - good in every aspect. "
5529," Mesmerizing and Powerful Lead, Beautiful Aesthetic & An Imperfect Script

5531," Cmon guys
"," This movie was good but not that good. It definitely is iconic and it is definitely unique but it isn't as good as the viewer reviews say it is. The critics are right, making the viewer uncomfortable doesn't get any awards "
5532," I didn't like it
"," I think the movie is not as impressive as in the comments. When I starting to movie, I was expecting that I like the character of Joker despite his poor role. But it didn't happen. The Joker in the ""the Dark Knight Rises"" was definitely better. Even incomparable. Surely there is difference of Christopher Nolan. But I have to say that the acting was perfect. The sounds and scenes was also very good. It was good movie but I reckon its exaggerated. "
5533," 9 only because..
"," The movie was amazing! It got a little slow at moments, but not for long. When it did pick back up it was like riding a roller coaster. 9/10. I think Joaquin Phoenix Joker beat Heath Ledgers, although they are very different. "
5534," GREAT but not HISTORIC as expected
"," Amazing acting and performance from all, especially Phoenix's , he was almost at heath ledger's level, but the scenario was so weak and unpleasant, too many non sense and unexplained stuffs and not relatable to batman on anyways even that they referred to him a lil bit , no build up for a second part ,batman or a coming joker, and not a great ending scene, summary: so weak scenario from DC and un relatble for the series. "
5535," the only reason for the low rating is a weak start
", Okay so lets start by saying after plenty of hype about this movie i expected nothing but perfection and in the begining the movie dragged very much and made me wonder what the people with the good reviews were smoking however about half way threw something began to happen i now see the praise and believe it such a good movie not oscar but good time 
5536," Gritty character study that lost its way and found back again
"," Joker is a very realistic character study about a delirious psychotic man named Arthur Fleck. His struggles, his cold nature, the city that is tearing itself apart, it is affecting him. Many of us can relate to this ourselves. And that is one of the reasons this ""film"" is a contemporary classic. Joker have conveyed the brutal truth about gun violence and have addressed a lot of social problems.
But more than that, the sheer method acting of Joaquin Phoenix is what keeps you captivated, the screen presence is so sublime yet firm. But all these pros still couldn't keep the film from sluggishness.
The 2nd act of the film is quite a bit "
5537," They should've named it 'teal and orange' instead of 'Joker'
",
5538," Better then all the Batman movies
", Go watch it I like it's better then all the Batman movies I gave it 10/10 
5539," Not compelling story, predictable plot, provocative for all the wrong reasons!
"," I kind of expected this film to not be that good and I was careful not to get in the ""hype train,"" but it's still sad watching it fail like this.<br/><br/>What fails the most in Joker is obviously the script. The story it's not something I would die to watch, keeping in mind Joker in the comics has some of the most compelling stories ever; the plot is basic and predictable; the theme that the film is trying to communicate, it's so poorly conveyed that I'm not even sure if that's the actual theme. The film is provocative for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The only good things about Joker are the score and, of course, Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance. "
5540," Different and sometimes difficult take on the villain's origin
",
5541," Exceptional!!
", In that arena of jokers from the past I welcoming Joaquin Phoenix as the new one that is gonna be a fantastic resemble. Todd make that film a brilliant one and Joaquin added the right flavor on it. And I feel always will Bruce be back again??? 
5542," You can't stop admiring
"," Like I said, you loose yourself. It is kind of guilty that you like joker but you can't avoid it, you smile with him , you cry with him , this flim pull you towards it. It is masterpiece, definitely deserve Oscar for the making wonder movie. I felt goosebumps at many scence, the music and acting are unbelievably awesome. Definitely try this movie, worth for every penny. "
5543," An average Joke
",
5544," Disappointed
", I am not sure of what all the hype was about. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job but the movie itself was boring and was longer than necessary. Half the time I felt that I was asking myself is any of this was truly happening? The best part for me is when it ended. I would rather have seen IT 2. 
5545," J
"," It is one of best movie i have see...
Joker can be a top movie on imdb... "
5546," Just a Bio pic !
"," It is art type movie. Portraying mental state of a man while he is trying to make people laugh but get only hate from them. His mother lied on him about his birth, his well wisher woman hates him, people beat him and he lose his job. All worst condition makes him like a psycho killer. The story is as such way in short. Though movie is better than average it does not entertain you at all. You have to only watch a biopic of Joker. Sometimes it seems a documentary too. The character of joker should be played by a younger actor because in future joker will have to fight younger Bruce Wayne (Batman) as per my opinion. Also Joker is not smart and clever as per role in comics. However acting by Joaquin Phoenix is very good and appreciable. Mury by Robet De Niro is noticeable character. No other character does have much scope in such solo type movie. If you want to see a good entertainer with well storyline then you must avoid this biopic, you will be surely disappointed. There is nothing to excite you till end so think before go to 'Joker' and considering its slowness too. High ratings are not appreciated. "
5547," It's a good movie but
"," It's a good movie but it's not near to a masterpiece, I know right that batman &amp; super heroes fanboys will always overrate these kind of films but the real truth is in the middle. The acting was insane, the photography too but the PLOT was really bad, the emotions were 0, secondary plots were left without a reason. It's a good film, but not a masterpiece "
5548," Undermines it's own mythology, and lore.
",
5549," Expected a different type of movie
"," The actor is very talented and his acting is good, but there's no real climax to the story. You watch the first half of the movie about how the man has issues and disorders , expecting for the ""joker"" to appear , but he doesn't until the last 20mins of the movie. Soundtracks are brilliant tho "
5550," Nice movie / far too overhyped
"," Great character, well done. For me the movie should have had more action and thrill. "
5551," Joker is Dangerously Incompetent
"," I read many other reviews before seeing this movie. A few said it was great, some said it sucked, but most just thought it was alright. It was just ok as movies go, but when you add in it's annoying intention to depress you with every frame of every scene of this movie you will ultimately end up questioning why you are subjecting yourself to this unnecessary torture. Here's how you know you have stayed on the Joker train too long; he will literally walk into the funniest moment in the movie. You will laugh because you'll appreciate that fleeting moment of fun before the darkness returns, bludgeoning you to death with depression. "
5552," What if Christopher Nolan direct it?
"," When the movie end, most of people in cinema were disappointed, they were expect to see the smartest evil character with his amazing tricks that we had watched before in previous Joker performed by the legend Heath Ledger in ""Dark Knight"", but unfortunately we just see a stupid psycho character, besides that the Joker looks old while Bruce Wayne child !! how they will face each other in future !? I think until Bruce become a Batman the Joker will be died at this time.<br/><br/>The performance of Joaquin was amazing with no doubts, also the pictures was stunning and remind us of the masterpiece ""The Dark Knight"".<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is worth to watch, but If Christopher Nolan direct or write ""Joker"", I think we would watch a masterpiece. "
5553," Too rude
"," This movie is too rude to be rated as R, it should be NC-17 since it's too dangerous for non-adult "
5554," Unnecessary violence, slow and confusing
"," Also, all the scenes to make him a victim seem forced. "
5555," Worse film ever
", I walked out I was so bored. I watch most films this I just didn't get. It made me feel uncomfortable. 
5556," An ill man who should have been in hospital
"," I understand that alot of the Joker characters are different, so I do not think we can compare the likes of Phoenix to Ledger, and if we did, the acting quality for both was 10/10. However, I thought the character was just mentally ill, and that he just belonged in a hospital. I didn't understand how from killing 3 people (which could have been argued in self defense) started a whole city wide revolution. In addition, I didn't think it was that dark or violent, the joker killed approximately 6 people (from memory) and that was it. There was alot of build up for an anticlimax of an ending, however, the film was exceptionally well made, camera work, acting, music was all fantastic, but for me, it didn't have the entertainment factor I was hoping for. "
5557," Sympathy for the Devil
"," Joaquin Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance as the most popular of Batman's adversaries in ""Hangover"" writer &amp; director Todd Phillips' ""The Joker,"" but this dreary, cruel DC Super Villain standalone saga qualifies as routine and forgettable. Indeed, this 'origins' film shares more in common with the television 'origins' series ""Gotham"" (2014-2019) where the heroes and villains who would later either align themselves with or against the Caped Crusader were depicted in their own embryonic stages of growth. Accordingly, in ""The Joker,"" the villainous maniac appears briefly in a scene with young master Bruce Wayne at stately Wayne Manor. Phillips treats the Joker as a victim skewered both by fate and society. Shaped in the callous crucible of a decadent society where only the strong survive-yes, a Darwinist society, we watch as Arthur Fleck, a lowly rent-a-clown, metamorphosizes from a friendly but forlorn fool into a full-blown psychotic fanatic. Phillips' sympathy for the Devil interpretation of the Joker represents yet another step in the never-ending evolution of the characters in the DC Universe.
If you're looking for a traditional clash of wits during the Joker's emergence as evil incarnate, you may be disappointed. Batman doesn't participate in his rudimentary antics because he hasn't grown up. This sociological storyline charts Arthur Fleck's rise from rotten soil, but there is little to admire apart from Phoenix's dynamic performance. Phillips' ""The Joker"" exemplifies what happens when an individual is treated as a victim of society rather than an architect of its terrors. Phoenix's Joker is neither as flamboyant as Jack Nicholson's sarcastic prankster in Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1988) nor as fiendish as Heath Ledger's the demented but cerebral nemesis in Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). We must not overlook Jared Leto's inspired Joker in David Ayer's spin-off ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), but who explored the Gotham villain in traditional terms like his predecessors. Meanwhile, despite its sketchy plot and ponderous tw0-hour length running time, Phillips desires praise for his imaginative evocation of everything 1970s when New York City loomed as a sleazy, dark, dangerous setting that spawned the pugnacious ""Death Wish"" movies as well as violent stalker movie ""Taxi Driver.""<br/><br/>You may either know or have known somebody like Arthur Fleck. A wholly pathetic but blissfully ignorant fellow, Arthur means well, but he winds up as his own worst enemy. At one point, he proclaims his mission in life is to make people smile. Fleck shares this laudable goal about himself when he finds himself transfixed in the spotlight of a local Big Apple television talk show, hosted by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro of ""Taxi Driver"") who amuses himself by ridiculing our protagonist. Star-struck by Murray and his moment in the lime light, Arthur aspires to be a stand-up comic. Sadly, he is far too perplexed by the puzzle of his warped psyche to succeed as a gifted comic. He spends more time crying than jesting when he appears in front of an audience at a nightclub. Earlier, Arthur revealed he resides with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy of ""Catwoman""), in a huge, anonymous apartment building where the residents are packed in tighter than sardines. Penny spins different versions of her own misguided life. A former employee of Thomas Wayne, Penny assures Arthur she toiled faithfully for the elder Wayne until she had to sign certain hush agreements before she landed in Arkham Asylum. Penny deludes poor Arthur into believing he is the offspring of a broken office romance with the titan of finance. ""The Joker"" treats Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen of ""The Dark Knight Rises"") as an ill-mannered, snobbish, billionaire who lacks his son's sympathy for the plight of others. Indeed, ""The Joker"" separates everybody in its universe into the 'haves' and the 'have-nots.' Eventually, this disparity between the impoverished lower classes and the affluent upper classes eventually erupts into a class war. Although he doesn't realize it, the Joker finds himself the messiah of the 'have-nots.' By this time, clown mania has swept New York, and denizens in white-face spark terror as they plunge into a rampage against law and order. This hysteria climaxes when a man in a clown mask-not Arthur Fleck's Joker-murders a well-dressed couple in a Gotham back alley but leaves their adolescent son unscathed with their blood spatter on his face!<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix has a field day as Arthur Fleck as well as the Joker. The devastating transformation during this two-hour opus is truly memorable. He gives the performance of a lifetime, and you cannot help but admire everything that Phillips and he do in his revisionist stab at the Joker. Not only does Phoenix make absurd faces, but he relies on genuinely bizarre body language to accentuate his inner wickedness. At times, he strikes postures that resemble a spider in its death throes. During a scene on a bus, Arthur amuses an African American lad with his facial frolics, but the child's mother is not amused. She reprimands Arthur, and he bursts into gales of hysterical laughter that mimic the Wicked Witch of the West from ""The Wizard of Oz."" This laughter alarms everybody on the bus, but it is creates the kind of atmosphere where you're tempted to join in with it. Earlier, when Arthur was doing a street gig outside a store that was going out of business, he is assailed by juvenile delinquents who steal his signboard, lead him on a merry chase, and then beat him black and blue in an alley. The best scene in ""Joker"" occurs during a subway encounter with three drunken businessmen. Arthur triumphs over evil, but he goes beyond the pale in an incident comparable to the Bernhard Goetz subway shooting in Manhattan in 1984. Instead of shooting African Americans, Arthur guns down three white guys with gusto. This launches him on his career of crime.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Joker"" amounts to the kind of mental health movie you need watch only once to get its deadly point. "
5558," Did not do it for me
"," Sorry but I did not like this movie.
I like drama but this was boring for me and too dark. Especially since this is fictitious town from a comic book and also a fictitious comic book character. It did not feel like a story about a real life person but just all made up for entertainment sake.
And the Joker not getting fired straight away for all his misconducts and inability to really make jokes was not believable. Especially after he took that gun to the hospital, in the real world who would have gotten fired instantly and reported to the police for illegal possession.
The talk show host was not really convincing either (I like Robert de Niro but this was not his best...) in regards to inviting him to the show. He actually thought he was a bad comedian so why invite him? To make fun out of him?
If I wanted to see a movie about a psychopath I would have wanted it to look more realistic and not have comic book character and half real life.
I have the feeling that some people watch the Marvel stories so much that they think the characters are real. "
5559," Actually dozed off a time or two
"," Phenomenal performance by Phoenix, as he was in every scene, but overall, I found the film a bit boring. My wife didn't attend with me because she'd read about how violent it was, but there was really only one particularly violent scene, and when it occurred over half-way through the film, my first thought was 'about time.' Not sure what I expected, but based on the hype, I expected to stay more engaged with the characters and story. Mostly, I was taken by how much wait Phoenix had lost for the role. "
5560," Good Not Great
"," I felt Phoenix did his thing but in my opinion his talents felt wasted to a certain extent. He could've shined more with a better director &amp; script. That's the difference between a Christopher Nolan &amp; Todd Phillips. The ending was amazing &amp; wish he could've had more screen time as ""Joker"" cause he did a great job at portraying him once he identified as him. "

5564," Interesting, but it was just too slow
"," Whenever I find myself antsy watching a film it's not a good ting. Just so incredibly slow. I had heard about Todd Philips' reason for making this as an anti-SJW film I wanted to see more of that theme in there, but none of that was in the film. It literally took 90 minutes before anything happened and when it did it was kinda anti-climatic. Too many people these days are in awe of almost anything.<br/><br/>It was too repetitive so there wasn't a lot of changes. It was basically one note throughout. I wish there would have been more of an arc. I never had a moment of ""oh wow"" or somehow connected this to the DC universe in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>Phoenix was great, but totally wasted in this blown opportunity. "
5565," Boring and interesting
", This movie is excellent for fewer audience but not for everyone. Everyone saying that this is the great movie and movie of the year but I find this movie is a type of wanted to leave the auditorium and but couldn't because of Phoenix acting and the oscar winning background score.<br/><br/>The message from movie is not a good one. Killing doesn't make anything perfect and there is no reason of killing the girlfriend and mom. Can't justify with the weak script. The script is trying to show the joker as hero but it doesn't.<br/><br/>De Nero is not required for this small role. I am huge fan of him. It's just a waste of good performer.<br/><br/>Overall this movie like onion. Just keep you occupied and nothing inside apart from good layers of acting and music. !!! 
5566," I didn't watch the movie yet but I got to say it !
"," The movie is about to be released, many fans are hyped about it and usually I don't put a review about any movie before I see it but this movie in special is kind of different! Because , one of the best movies to me of all time is "" The dark Knight "" and heath ledger in this movie did the Joker's character in a way that is hard to beat ! For some reason in between all the actors who did the Joker's character , heath ledger did reach a point where no one can reach or far beyond reach ! If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the movie again and you will know ! But that doesn't necessarily will prevent me from watching Joaquin's version ! Or even liking it ! Joaquin without doubt is an excellent actor , he's already proven to be in many previous roles and I'm sure he will add to the character some of his brilliant performance but I believe the movie needs more than Joaquin's Talent to beat Heath's version of the joker ! I'll watch the movie with no expectations so I can enjoy it as just a MOVIE. "
5567," IT WAS AIGHT
", Meh. Joaquin Phoenix was good as usual but waited to long to deliver the goods. 
5568," Good Theme On Bullying
"," My adult daughter really wanted to see this with me. Her and I have mother/daughter ""Dinner and a movie"" dates about once a month. I'm not a fan of Joaquin Phoenix, and I'm not a huge fan of DC, Marvel, Etc. Since we must give and take when it comes to choices, I agreed to see this with her. Funny thing is, I enjoyed the movie a lot more than she did! LOL I believe the movie was well done and the acting was really good. Be careful to not compare it to other movies, you may be disappointed. One aspect that I really appreciate it about this is that society is trying to shed more light on the effects of bullying. So the moral behind the story is very much needed. I would actually give it a 6.7 rating. "
5569," You get what you deserve.
"," This film is strictly a character development of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and how he transformed into The Joker. They could have done this in a number of different ways. In this film, he is a deranged vigilante in the battle of haves vs have nots. We do see Bruce Wayne as a child with Arthur many years his senior. It takes about 90 minutes until the big action happens. I was a bit disappointed when they made Joker brain-damaged rather than a criminal mastermind. The production takes place during the time span of about a month or so. His childhood is discussed, but not shown.<br/><br/>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. No Batman. No Harley Quinn. "
5570," More DC mediocrity
"," The big question is... does the Joker need an origin story? And the quick answer is no. What is great about the Joker is that he is an enigma. He's a symbol of chaos. And this film tried and failed to make him a person. Phoenix did a good job, his acting is great, don't get me wrong. He did a good job at being just that little bit creepy. But the film itself was subpar at best. And to be honest, I couldn't wait for it to be over. "
5571," Underwhelming
"," Checking my watch an hour in, never a good sign. This film really doesn't show even a whisper of brilliance until the last 45 minutes, and even then, those big reveal scenes are still predictable, spoiler alert, she was never really there! When the music is noticeably more powerful than the scene in which it's supposed to depict, you know you're in trouble, I actually remember sitting there thinking, this music is too powerful for the scene, the film just didn't live up to the power of the soundtrack, unlike that of the the Batman trilogy which this film seemed to be hoping to emulate. This film could have the potential to be great, Jaoquin did a good job, especially since he pretty much carries the entire film on his own, the problem was, the story line just wasn't that great! Should you go watch this film? Maybe, but you're probably best going the bar first, having a few drinks and sitting down an hour in to the movie, you would probably have a better time and wouldn't miss much of the plot, plus, you'd probably have the last laugh!

",
5573," Seven
"," Violence, indifference, greed, lie, comedy, illusion, Joker. "
5574," No Joke.
"," This is a different kind of ""superhero"" movie that has more in common with Scorcese drama and less with the faeces films of the MCU, but that doesn't mean it is actually that good.<br/><br/>It takes itself way too seriously in a way that doesn't add any depth. The tempo is unbalanced. Phoenix does a good job, but the character is simply an impression of a violently psychotic individual, rather than an accurate portrayal. Camera, lighting and music are alright, but tedious. All in all this is a decently made, rather boring film that will mostly appeal to people with little sense of relativity and it would have been better without the comic book element.<br/><br/>And by the way, when it comes to that comic book aspect, they completely missed the point of the character. "
5575," Superb acting doesn't make this a 10
"," Phoenix is superb , some of the best acting I have ever seen, but it can't hide the tedious pace of 2/3s of the movie. I don't understand the hype of the 10 reviews , and at the same time don't understand the people that walked out on it . It's a good movie with splendid acting and at times a bit boring. "
5576," OK film, could have been better
"," Overall, this film was alright. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Joker, as expected, was decent. I enjoyed many parts of the movie. There were also a lot of memorable quotes. I have to give credit where it's due. However, that's not to say that this film was flawless. Probably the main problem and why other critics are disliking this movie is because of its story. There were some parts of the story that were unnecessary and could've been left out. Other parts just felt too slow, which works well in some films but in this one not so much. I expected this film to be better but it certainly isn't horrible. Also, anyone who says this movie is too violent clearly hasn't seen many movies. From all the controversy that has been going on, I expected this film to be very violent, but it actually isn't as violent as other movies. Check it out if you want, you may enjoy it or hate it. For me, I think it was alright/mediocre. "
5577," Don't see what the big fuss is about
", Well don't see what the big fuss is about the actor was great but there are a lot of better DC and Marvel movies they dragged out him before he became the Joker to long while I stayed and watched it all a lot of people left before it was over the only exciting part of the movie was the last 15 -20 minutes of it Wonder Woman and Aquaman was leaps and bounds over this film almost not worth my money to see it in theater. 
5578," It's a movie
", Jared Leto was the best joker. This guy can't even tie his shoes. Also his laugh was dorky and his mom drove a helicopter. 
5579," Shouldn't have been a Batman Movie
"," This movie did not have to be associated with Batman, yet they forced in the Wayne family even as far as to have a clown mask-wearing henchmen be the catalyst for Batman's origin. It felt like the writer had no idea where to take the film after Arthur shoots Murray.<br/><br/>This could have been a great story about a depressed person whom the system fails that cracks and commits a series of atrocities. But the fact that I was supposed to believe this guy is Batman's arch-nemesis the whole movie left me wanting. At no point did I believe this guy could inspire others to violence - his supposed attack on the elite on the subway was a guy shooting in self-defense after getting his ass kicked. There's no way I would believe that would be the tipping point to spark the riots in the last half of the movie.<br/><br/>And the Zazie Beetz ""reveal"" that she and Arthur weren't really a thing- if you believed that the romance was not a hallucination of a sick man when we are CLEARLY watching the movie from his perspective, then shame on you... but the fact that Todd Phillips felt the need to show the romance was a fabrication was an insult to the audience.<br/><br/>I was extremely bored in the film, didn't think it deserved the buzz it received, and it left me just feeling sad. "
5580," Not your typical comic book character movie NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 13/14 yrs old
"," I did not enjoy this movie. It is dark,depressing,and disturbing. There is an audience for this film -just not me. Joquin Pheonix is an outstanding actor -I just could not feel any sympathy towards his character because I didn't like his character. That is because his character is not likable. This was never meant to be a mainstream film, there is no humor in it whatsoever and although it was terrible (IMO of course) I'm sure it is destined to be a cult classic like ""eraserhead"" and certain John Waters films. "
5581," Excellent acting but dark and sad theme and plot
"," The joker was not able to make him full of pranks, mystificous, and full of suspense because you never know what he is going to do next. Instead we got a sad biography on top of darkness. What happened to the comic book joker and batman and Robin joker. A real let down "
5582," For Joaquin fans, this is a field day...
"," ...for the rest of us, not so much. Does Warner Bros really want to take its franchise down this road? "
5583," Good but not great
"," Good but not great. However, I loved the Joker laugh üòÄ "
5584," Can't believe they killed off ROBERT DE NIRO
"," What where they thinking, I only watched this movie for De Niro and they killed him off! "
5585," Boring Boring Boring
"," Although I appreciate the actor and settings, I don't know why people keep overrating this boring movie. From the beginning to the end, it proved not to be real comedy, or psycho film. I watched many thriller films like SAW. This film is absolutely no match to those great films. Throughout the movie, you will hardly find time to be excited and mesmerized by the show. It is a waste of my time watching this film with great expectations believing in overrated stars. "
5586," Promising movie bogged down by sloppy writing and editing
"," Almost everyone who appreciates the whole Batman realm has at one time or another considered that a stand alone movie about the Joker character's origins would be great. I know this is not an opinion of the majority, but Joker doesn't quite make it to ""great"". This movie feels sloppy (for some reason this word just seems to fit). Some might say that calling this movie sloppy is not appreciating the abstract element of Joker; but there is good abstract, and there is just plain old sloppy writing..<br/><br/>For example, the first hour of this movie seemed sloppily edited together: you could chop apart every scene in the first hour of Joker and edit them together in any random order and the storyline would still be confusing and the pace of the movie woul still drag. Some occasional definition of what Arthur Fleck was imagining and what was real would have helped.<br/><br/>This movie spent too much of the first half establishing Arthur's relationship with his mother. And after all the screen time given to this storyline, we still really don't know if he was adopted or not. This is true of most of the plot lines in Joker. Again, to me Joker felt less like a movie with abstract conclusions that challenge the viewer to fill in the blanks than a sloppily written and edited collection of dead ends. For movies like 'the Hangover' franchise (also from director Todd Phillips) sloppy works great, but not for Joker.<br/><br/>In an alternate universe, wouldn't it be interesting see see what kind of movies would have been made if director Todd Phillips was making a movie combining King of Comedy and Taxi Driver ( which Joker is obviously heavily influenced by) and left the Batman realm out of it completely? And at the same time, (in this alternate universe) director Tim Burton is writing and directing a stand-alone movie about the origins the the Joker character? It can't be argued that the results would be interesting!<br/><br/>It seems that Joker is ""given a free pass"" on some of it's shortcomings possibly because, as I said at the beginning of this review, a lot of Batman fans including myself, had been thinking (in the back of their minds at least) how great a movie dedicated to the Joker's story could be. And it could have been. "
5587," Great acting but did not get me intrigued
"," The movie surely does not surpass the hype!<br/><br/>Phoenix's acting was one of a kind, you could feel every little inch of face and body immersing in acting like a harmony but that is about it. The movie flawed with boredom, a slow rhythm that lacks the juice that would keep you on all toes. The end is just below average.<br/><br/>You should definitely watch it but not necessarily on the big screen because you won't miss anything exceptional! "
5588," Below expectations movie .
", Its away below expectations with the whoop and Reputation before watching the movie. 
5589," Has its merits
"," Some would make you believe it's a masterpiece. it's not, top notch acting by Phoenix, sure but that's it. The script is pedestrian and predictable. Also the Joker would not have let Gary live, the joke would have been on him because he was the only person who treated Fleck kindly. Plus the lines Joker said before killing Franklin were just to on the nose about mental health. The Joker isn't that self-aware. "
5590," Very dark
"," I found the first hour a real hard watch, to see someone struggling so hard with mental health was a very dark piece of cinema and at times I questioned wether this was entertaining. I got it and I guess for the film to have the impact it did then it needed to go to that dark place. It's brilliantly shot and some amazing acting but I felt coming out of the cinema just bad for people's personal struggles but glad they don't all go to the places Joker did. "
5591," Dark Phoenix
",
5592," ""A well-polished crap.""-My friend
"," Beware the Mentally Ill!
Is that the message?
Or is it ""Overthrow the rich!""
I guess Joker isn't supposed to have a point, but still what are we supposed to take away from this?
The performance is great, I'll give it that, you can't take that away from it, but did we need to know Joker's origin story? I kind of like the mystery of he's just a guy who's crazy. It leaves more to the imagination. Also, Joker is supposed to be this criminal mastermind, and in this movie he's just a loser with mental problems. It's alright...Wayy darker than I expected. Leaves you with questions and there's a few things that aren't explained super well. I'm not expert but I feel like there could have been more of a ""transformation"" of the character, but whatever. Who cares? Why am I writing this? I could be sleeping. "
5593," Highly overrated
", Yup it's good indi movie but definitely overrated by DC fans. 
5594," Finally !!!! DC has a hit
", Phoenix was great. Couldn't take my eyes off screen 
5595," BORING, predictable and has nothing on DARK KNIGHT RISES
"," Overhyped film, really slow, predictable, low budget, hardly any fight scenes. Didn't enjoy it in the cinema and almost fell asleep. Would of got up and walked out for a refund if I was on my own. Heath ledgers performance as the joker was more believable, scary and funny.<br/><br/>This joker film isn't funny and I didn't laugh once. It's a low budget cash grab, with an actor who cant laugh properly and someone who clearly wasnt invested in his role and was clearly after the pay cheque. No wonder he has not been so active in movies for years. He is so unlikeable.<br/><br/>Joker is simply overhyped. "
5596," No Laughing Matter
"," The movie wants you to be uncomfortable. And you are uncomfortable, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. Phoenix obviously does a great job as Joker but it's pretty dull. The last 25 minutes is the most entertaining, but that doesn't make up for the first hour and half. "
5597," 7-10
"," 7/10 - I didn't like Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker and all the movie I was just missing Heath Ledger, the movie is all about a patient with emotional incontinence, just laughing and crying all the movie nothing more, but my rating goes for the music and the videography that really impressed me.
#mg_movies_reviews "
5598," One of the best horror comedies of the year
"," I could see Joaquin Phoenix winning an Oscar for his performance. His Joker is like Tom Brady to Heath Ledger's Joe Montana. Joe was the best quarterback of all time. There would never be another quarterback as great or greater than him despite the fact that Terry Bradshaw also won 4 Super Bowls. I hate the cheater Tom Brady; but I thank God and Bill Belichick for Tom Brady so everybody can shut up about Joe Montana. That's how good Joaquin Phoenix is in this movie. Sorry Heath, R.I.P. Heath Ledger's Joker jumped the shark when he killed Michael Jai White's character fresh off of him playing Spawn. He lost me right there.<br/><br/>The kids are in school so I got to see a matinee in a relatively sparse theater. I burst out laughing several times and I was the only one laughing. I am not sure if I was supposed to laugh. In light of recent events in the real world I wonder how a packed audience will react to Robert Deniro's character getting killed by Joker. By the time he meets his fate I was totally sympathetic to Joker as he was being lambasted by Robert Deniro much like Mr. Deniro has been lambasting President Trump. That scene was very surreal.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie; but it could have used a cameo or two from a super hero or super villain. It was an interesting character study up to the point where it started to get boring. I hung in there and the pace picked up and it finished with a bang. "
5599," Really you guys?? :)
", This movie is just like the movie for kids. It's overrated 
5600," It's not a bad movie, but it's overrated
"," I went to see this in the cinema and wasn't blown away as many seem to be. I think this is one of those cases where people jump on the bandwagon and praise a movie mostly because it's been receiving a lot of praise. I didn't see that much value in it.<br/><br/>The movie isn't bad at all, and Phoenix does a very good job as Joker, but that's about it. The movie doesn't really offer anything new that would be noteworthy and the tone of the entire movie is very dark and sad and desperate. These are the conditions Joker finds himself in, which isn't unexpected in the least, but then at some point in the movie we find out that Joker has lost his mind because he was imagining some of the things we had seen. This, to me at least, defeats the purpose of the setting of the movie (a city in ruin), because it's revealed that Joker is insane and the woman that adopted him was insane, as well.<br/><br/>So, the grim landscape, garbage everywhere, the economy, Joker's sad life, all of this is meant to show us how a monstrous society created one of the most well-known villains of all time. But then the movie also tells you ""Oh btw, he's crazy whatever which way you turn it."" This, then, leads me to think the entire movie is overdone and certain aspects don't make too much sense or are not really needed. Because for me personally, it would have been more chilling if Joker had been living in normal conditions and his insanity still shone through and made him what he is. That would have struck more cords as it would emphasize the aspect of the Joker that makes him what he is - his lack of mental health.<br/><br/>I suppose it's inevitable to compare this to Ledger and The Dark Knight. Not doing this to wind anyone up, as I can see many people are passionate about claiming Phoenix's superiority over Ledger for this role. I think Ledger is still unmatched and I don't think this is particularly close. The reason for this is that Ledger's Joker seems far more intelligent and his lunacy appears more real and more pronounced, whereas I have the feeling Phoenix's Joker is timid, shy, afraid and confused and ultimately snaps due to a mixture of frustration and insanity. But I don't feel as if Phoenix's Joker is a character that can/will develop into Ledger's Joker, it seems like a big leap and I see a lack of some common traits between the two. In a sense, I think this is an attempt not to tell us the story of how the Joker came to be, but to create a different Joker, which in the end turns out to be an inferior character to the Joker that made the supervillain famous.<br/><br/>Also, for me The Dark Knight develops the character of the Joker more than the movie centered around Joker, which is saying something. The most striking part of the character for me (in Batman) were the nuances and subtleties of what Ledger showed us, just small details that add to the tone of the character. Ledger had this ability to show at the same time how his character was incredibly intelligent and devious and also crazy and just generally unstable and messed up. This is not present in Phoenix's portrayal. There are no scars on the Joker's mouth, there's no ""Why so serious?"". What little we got about the character's backstory in The Dark Knight was more telling and more chilling than the entire plot of Joker. "
5601," Phenomenal.
", Great job by Joaqin Phoenix. Only a few movies that impact you to such an extent and Joker is one of them. Joker is dark and very well not for everyone. It's takes more than a normal movie goer to understand small intricacies from the dark tone to the characters from the batman universe.

5616," Exceptional performance that leaves you with a chill
"," Arthur peck, the fragile and broken clown. Only trying to do good and is always put down by society in various forms. Joaquin Pheonix displays the development, with the assistance of the director Todd Philips, in a way that the viewer does not really know what is going to happen throughout the movie. I was so thrown away by Joaquin that I do not think he knew what was going to happen. Every decision including killing seemed like something that just happened along the way because the joker saw that it was relevant to him at the time.<br/><br/>The Joker's laughter is something to note as well. It is between a histeric laugh and a wild cry and everything in between. It is truly a character trait that Joaquin has made for himself and the character.<br/><br/>The character development set some really big stones. understanding that the Joker has been through a life of hell and dealing with a ferocious society on a daily basis has made him numb to feeling anything. He kills without feeling any remorse and has become nonscholant to any pain.<br/><br/>I do not think that the viewer agrees or identifies with the Joker but it does give the aspect of understanding him.<br/><br/>Well played Joaquin and Todd!

"," My first review<br/><br/>I was brought up thinking the Joker was a baddy, but now with this film we see what has created this character and maybe this is how all villains are created, life isn't black and white, so when we are younger it is better and simpler to understand. The choses aren't the same for everyone, so when we Judy characters it from our point of view and this film guides you through a different point of view, which may change the way we view batman in the future.<br/><br/>We don't know if this is the joker which batman fights, but we now see why they don't get on, but if they are related it could explain a lot. "
5621," Not something you see everyday
"," This film really knocks it out of the park. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the score...it's all great. This films isn't eye candy like Endgame, it's an in depth character study that shows how the joker is born. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable as this film touches on uncomfortable issues that we don't like to talk about. 10/10, a must see in theaters. "
5622," The hype is real
"," Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway. "
5623," Great Movie.
"," I saw Joaquin's first Joker Reel in the teaser a year ago and thought it looked pretty terrible. Mainly because of the choice of music. The movie actually had a pretty good choice of music (taking place in what seemed like the early to mid eighties). And it turns out the Joker is a pretty freaky dude. The origin story was so well done that he is actually freakier than the enigmatic Ledger version.<br/><br/>While this is a great standalone origin story, the studio would be absolutely stupid not to incorporate this joker into the next Batman movie. If rumor is to be believed, WB will try and outdo themselves again and continue their fail streak.<br/><br/>If you need to have a Robert Pattinson/Leto kids version and a grittier R-Rated version with Phoenix and a different Bruce Wayne (idk, maybe Josh Brolin is the IT clown guy), then DO IT! "
5624," Masterpiece
", I am still in speachless state after 2 days I watched it and all I want to do is go back to the cinema and watch it again. His acting you never saw before. This movie is touching a very deep and serious problem and how much a society doesn't care and what can it do to the person who is already suffering with a mental illness. It can go both way. It's heartbreaking all he wants to do to make people smile and they laughed at him instead of with him. He was very simple minded person who wanted to be liked and listened. But nobody did till something terrible happened.....and that switched him to the other side where he never wanted to go....but society pushed him. I loved his laugh his moves his dancing on the stairs... The last 15 minutes gives the epic ending. He need to get the Oscar for this performance.

5628," Realistic and immersive story

He tries to stem against this but you see him getting weaker by the minute. In the end you feel like it's a logical consequence for Arthur to snap and become crazy.
In my opinion it's a great movie that gives you a lot to think about. "

I really want to see more from this.<br/><br/>I love how the movie keeps you guessing and how so many people can interpret it in so many different ways. It also portrays society today and it has attracted so many fans. A massive well to to everyone for creating this movie. I love it. "

"," I saw Joker last week and I still can't stop thinking about it. The acting, cinematography, music, lights, colours, all were amazing. I think there are many scenes that are going to be classic over the years like dance on stairs, putting his blood as a smile and so on. I'm really glad that they looked from a different angle and treated the story in a psychological way rather than including CGI stuff. That way I felt more connected to the character. I have to mention that Phoenix did a fantastic job here in this film by showing us all the emotions he's struggling from beginning to end. I loved feeling uncomfortable by watching a twisted mind in this dark atmosphere.
I think it's not right to compare Phoenix's Joker to Ledger's, because their roles took part in Joker's different eras. Phoenix played his birth, and Ledger played his prime. Both performances were amazing without doubt.
I can't wait to watch Joker again and definitely recommend it to anyone. "
5645," Do you remember Gladiator? This will shake you further.
"," As a strong marvel fan I can tell you - this is not one of the crappy DC movies that look like an old wet newspaper. This thing is a masterpiece. All my respect to Joaquin Phoenix for this incredible performance. He makes like 80% of the movie. But the rest 20% is still the best DC has shown to us till now - the music (OMG), the atmosphere, the tension.
DC - show us the Harley Quinn's story this way! "
5646," Ignore the naysayers..go believe for yourself.

5648," I gotta say, best joker performance of all time
"," I don't want to say much because nothing to say. the movie left speechless. I swear when I left the cinema, the first time in my all life I felt that I want to go back and see more. I swear I didn't want the movie to end. I wanted to see the next, the next joker. I am a fan of DC characters, specially Batman and Joker. And batman with (Ben Affleck) wasn't as good as (Christian Bale). same goes with Joker, after (Heath Ledger) the Joker died too. But now The Joker rises, and this make me so excited to see what next of (Robert Pattinson) the new Batman. Because Christian and Heath was a perfect pair in the movie. I hope Joaquin and Robert will do the same and more. (I believe they will do)<br/><br/>Thanks DC for this refreshing and powerful movie. "
5649," Pretty Good.
", A slightly over-long examination of how Joker became Joker. Phoenix is outstanding and it's very difficult to see how the film could really be seen as a justification of his actions: he's pretty horrible. The whole film is immensely depressing but also very impressive. 
5650," First movie ever making me want to write a review
"," Just see it, its a masterpiece! It helps if you've seen Batman movies before but its not necessary. Not a typical super hero flick though! "
5651," Just perfect
"," The acting skills, the plot, the shooting, amazing. "
5652," Masterpiece
"," It was the best movie I've seen since dark knight.dc really took it to the next level
And Joaquin Phoenix was so good i can't even describ it with words he really took care of heath ledger's legacy "
5653," A call for social connection
",
5654," A perfect fit.
"," For people unfamiliar with DC comics and the portrayal of the joker... joker is dark, dangerous and ultimately depressing, but never do you understand his intentions and he keeps you guessing. The film is the same. This is a true representation of the Joker. The question of Joker can even have an origin story is perpetuated by this film. The best way to watch this story is through Batman's eyes. Distrust it and be forensic. You might see the fun through all the depression. Oh and for those who don't think comics can have truly dangerous feeling villains, just look at the fact that this villain has found its way into the Distain of both conservative and progressive liberal minds for being dangerous to the ""real world"". "
5655," Heartbreaking yet üíî Dramatically Excellent
", This gave me everything possible in the way of character development and progression. A domino effect of events that ultimately gives birth to the Villian doing the Most! 
5656," GREAT MOVIE
"," Im speechless
A Masterpiece
It tells a truth about the society
how life form someone in something "
5657," Not your classic Batman-series flick
"," A well-acted, down-to-earth, real-life film, an Origins story without any surprising elements to tell us how Mr. Fleck turned to the dark side - he had probably always been this kind of guy, waiting for enough drops to add up to fill his glass. It's great that people really liked this movie, even though there wasn't the action one would have expected - I guess all of us could relate to what he went through, add to that great acting from J. P., a very good team and you have a great movie. "
5658," Best movie in 2019
"," I always felt stressed and depressed during my entire adult life. Some scenes of the movie made me feel for the character, because I was also poor and couldn't see much hope in the future. Besides, I also have history of psychological disease. It ruined my life.<br/><br/>It's a little ironic that the best film about mental illness I've seen is Joker. To me, Joker is much more relatable than Beautiful Mind.<br/><br/>I wish there could be more good films about people who suffers mental illness, even better if it is not based on comic books. "
5659," A ¬Ω excitement for an average film!
"," I'm kind of mixed about this Picture and was a little confused about rating it. Globally, it is no way a bad movie, neither a very good one. The film is boring during the first half, and exciting in the second half. It is easily understandable, and the plot is clear, however, it's painful to watch sometimes. The films contains no positivity, no optimism. All seems sad and bad. Then, what's good about it? It's a psychological film, so you can ""enjoy"" an evolution of the character, and of the set. Then, there is a real excitement felt during the last 30 min of the film, plus a brilliant Oscar-worthy acting by Joaquin Phoenix, and political allusions about the bad time we are living now. It can make you aware and think about the situation, but doesn't give you any solution at all. Overall, it's an exciting but too much violent movie. Quite frankly, Best Actor in a Leading Role is the only Oscar it could get, and maybe a little chance with Best Film Editing and Original Score. "
5660," Forget about the critics, mainstream media and other naysayers - this is a great movie
"," In our current climate of highly politicized cinema, ridiculous budgets, over-saturation of CGI and poor acting in mainstream movies, this film was a delight.<br/><br/>Gritty, Grimy, Funny, Sad, Tragic - I could go on all day, this film was made with accuracy, precision and most of all care. Care for the craft of excellent cinematography, storytelling, acting, sound engineering, production and directing.
It really captured the feel of the depression, crime, despair and dirt that was early 1980s New York but masked under the name of Gotham.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype, don't believe the critics, don't believe the commentators with their ulterior political motives, just go watch this movie and see if for yourself. You might not think it's a 10/10 but you will at least see a movie that is made with solid craftmanship and will leave you pondering about Arthur and the events of the film long after you have left the cinema. "
5661," A fresh, unique take on the character
"," Just saw it a few days ago so it's fresh in my mind. Joaquin's Joker is nothing like Heath Ledger's Joker, but in the best way possible. He's unstable and is driven to insanity by the society that surrounds him. The cinematography on display here is stunning and the score by Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir was one of my favorite aspects of the film. Watching Arthur's descent into madness is depressing and dark, and the ending to this movie is insane, as the third act is definitely the part where the movie kicks into high gear. Also, the way it ties in Batman's origin isn't annoying at all and actually fits in well at the end of the movie. "
5662," A Movie that Surpasses Cinema
"," This movie truly belongs to the people.
This Joker was a psychological roller coaster. Deep, dark and funny(scary).
Just to figure out why he laughed was a mystery in itself and takes darkness to a whole new level.
Acting performance of Pheonix is on another planet. He really does carry the film on his shoulders. Its a one man film and supporting cast are elements in which the character builds on.
This is a movie you cannot miss. "
5663," A targeted masterpiece
"," This film is without a doubt a piece of art, the acting by Joaquim is just perfect, with a good performance by the whole casting too, leaving a constructive and reflective message about our society and it's culture, the only negative and peculiar aspect about this film is the persecution driven by the mainstream media to fill the internet and news outlets of nonsense bad reviews like ""its too violent"", ""its bad because its bad"" or the most bizarre article i've ever seen reviewing a film wich says ""the problem with the film is it whiteness"", well, I guess the mainstream media (and only them, obviously) really is scared about this film's message. "
5664," Very well made and acted
"," I was astonished to see more than 5,000 reviews posted for this film. That means a lot of people have seen this and are talking about it. The basic premise of this film involves a man trying to bring joy into the world while battling mental illness.
The city of Gotham and our main character seem to be linked as both are on a downward spiral. There is a combination of him living with the choices that he makes as well as dealing with the things he can't control. I suggest you see this film when you are in a real good mood for it will not be a feel good movie. Might I also suggest you either go on an empty stomach or keep an empty bag of popcorn to throw up in for there is one gruesome death scenes that might even make Ridley Scott say ""Holy crap."" Joaquin Phoenix's performance was nothing short of phenomenal. He definitely carries the film and the box office success loudly proclaims that the public is in agreement. Todd Phillips and Bradley Cooper are once again a winning team from behind the camera. "
5665," Believe what you read - this movie is next level!
",
5666," Well that was a surprise!
",
5667," Hype-Worth & Mind Blowing movie for Everyone! (except kids üòâ)
"," First of all, WOW! The Hype for the movie was worth it and it's probably the first and the best origins story for a villain! The plot was just mind blowing as the movie builds up the character of the Joker! Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding play of the Joker and for now, he makes a pretty good competition to Heath Ledger (R.I.P)! It's certainly a must-see movie for comic-book and non-comic-book fans! You won't regret!
Two more things: 1) Not many has talked about it but the soundtrack of the movie is so dark and so good!
2) Watch it on IMAX! U won't REGERT! "
5668," Beware!!! rave review coming up
",
5669," Not everyone gets the joke but he will definitely be the only one laughing when it is punchtime
"," When you are down, depressed and hurting inside, when society creates a false sense of security, all you got to do is introduce a little anarchy. Upsetting the natural order has always been what the Joker is best at and Joaquin Phoenix is remarkable as the Joker.<br/><br/>This movie touches on the lack of empathy of the high end society and the pain and suffering only those at the bottom of the chain feel. It brings out emotions you never knew you had balled up inside you.<br/><br/>You root for the protagonist despite knowing what he is going to do and is going to become, you empathize with the scum of Gotham like you are one of them. This movie gives a whole new reason for the cringy pulse dropping menacing laugh of the joker and a deeper meaning to his whole psychotic persona and why he is by far the best villain ever. "
5670," Best Joker since ledger
"," I cannot believe it is this good but it is, Phoenix pulled it off i will not spoil a single thing because you MUST watch it for yourself "
5671," Incredible
"," The acting was incredible, you'd think he was a real person not just a character. Scenes were filmed well, the story was written so damn well. Super accurate depiction of mental health and the decline of American society and the struggles of the lower class. Not an action film, just a beautifully written dark back story. "
5672," True dramatic movie to watch
"," At first i think what a joker title movie would be?
But after watching it on hall,realized that some films can be make without the heroism charecter,deep meaning can be told, also oscar will be sure won without the touch ofthe heroic comic charecte..
Hope every one will, likes it üëç "
5673," Joker is amazing
"," I want to say something more and more, however, my writing and alphabets talents are too weak to do it.
so I just congratulated this film's box office is 10 times than its budget.
well then, good for Joaquin and Todd, you made it. well done!
it's not a Marvel-type movie, it's a fantastic drama one. don't expect you could see some excellent action scenes, in contrast, you could see plenty of deeply meditations. "
5674," What a blast !
"," I had soooo much expectations for that movie, I was kinda scared of being disapointed.....
But no !!!!
The best movie since many years, seriously !!
And to me, this is THE BEST ACTING PERFORMANCE EVER.
Good direction, perfect music, and Joaquim Phoenix....
Just go see it and judge by yourself. "
5675," Metacritics is getting shitter
"," After viewing why the prestigiously gorgeous Metacritics gives such a score, I believe these ""critics"" are just trying to reject the hype of the movie, so that they tell the other audience that they are special, professional, unlike normal ones. The worst comment comes from the New Yorker. It uses the majority of that article to tell that the director whitewashes some cases that the critic believes by which the scenes in the film are inspired, criticising that it makes the film empty. Well, vaffanculo!!! "
5676," Possibly one of the best movies ever made
"," So let's forget for a second that this is a comic book based movie. If you took away the iconic Joker name this would still be an amazing movie. This is an intense, and I mean intense, look at what people with a mental illness who have been disregarded by life can turn into. I knew what the end game would eventually be but you can't help but hope he finds compassion and acceptance to stop the transformation into the Clown Prince of crime. This movie really reflects on the day and age we live in so it really hit home with me. Of course I don't condone any type of violence I do however understand his frustration and his struggle to be positive. Turns out you can only push someone down so many times before they stand up for themselves. All in all I have to say this may in fact be the most amazing and powerful movie I've ever seen in my life. Definitely worth watching. Oh and Joker is not going to incite some kind of horrific event nor was it inspired by one. People choose to do horrible things, can't blame a movie for a tragic event. "
5677," Taking it's time in a fast paced world
"," Really enjoyed that they took their time with each scene. Letting the viewer take in the full magnitude of the scene and the effect of what's happening to Happy (Joker). Beautifully shot though I don't like the flares of the DNA primes which takes me out of the story and makes me aware that I'm watching it through something. The acting of Mr Pheonix is incredible, you can really feel the depth of his character. The flashbacks with his neighbor disappearing felt too much on the nose. Could have skipped those. Over all a brilliant piece of cinema. "
5678," TRULY GREAT!
"," Joker is a remarkable display of character development. Joaquin never disappoints and it was phenomenal how I was totally hooked on the villain -- just at the very end I remembered of the actor itself. Although the producers have denied, this may be the dawn of the DCCU with greatness! I'm gonna watch it again so Warner understands this is their way to success with comic books movies! "
5679," (Portuguese & English Review) ""Strongly shocking and artistic"" / Fortemente chocante e art√≠stico
"," ""Joker is a criticism that ranges from the poorest class in society to the high rich brand. It shows violence as crudely as possible, making it more real, flirting without soundtrack to mild sadism. Arthur's cruel reality shapes a sense of psychological incapacity, making him susceptible to the violence he receives, whether for himself or for those around him. As much as Arthur's attitudes may be somewhat justifiable, he shows the viewer a sense of guilt in feeling empathy. It turns happiness and its most common way of expressing it into a sadness."" "

"," My favorite quote from the movie, ""the worst part part about having a mental illness is people expecting you not to have one."" My words may not be exact but wow. I'm going to to watch it again "
5686," A fascinating character study
"," Joker is a character study of troubled comedian Arthur Fleck, from his earlier attempts in establishing a career in comedy, to the rise of his inner dark persona.<br/><br/>The bleak tone of the film is set since its very first sequence, using a slowly moving camera at times and hand held one at others, the long shots follow the seemingly uncalculated movements of Joaquin as he portrays one of the most fascinating characters to hit the big screen.<br/><br/>When a movie as massive but mostly as praised as Joker comes out, it is not hard to fall in love with it, but it is easier to hate it on the grounds that it did not meet the high expectations. Joker is not only a reimagination of a loved villain, but also a reinvention of its genre. Breaking the classic storytelling process viewers are used to in comic-based productions. It is funny, chaotic and devastating, and the ideal way to experience would be expecting nothing and getting lost in its sombre universe. "
5687," What a movie!
", I went to the cinema as a Batman fan and came back home as a member of the Joker's Gang. It's one of the best DC movies ever. 
5688," Ok
"," Best movies of the year. I expected to bad because of the director and the joker isn't a character that you can be OK with, either you hate like jared Leto or love it like heath ledger. Joaquin is right there with heath. I want to keep the rating above 9 and that is why i chose to write my first review and it is for this movie "
5689," Remarkable
"," With a more humanized Joker in origin, no longer simply being some anarchic guy, the film features a series of sensations to the viewer, including empathy with the poor Arthur. In addition to the plot, which is sensational, certainly Joaquin Phoenix's work is remarkable, it's brilliant. "
5690," Oscar winner

"," If you're in any way unsure about movies that are dark, I wouldn't recommend you watch it. It is without a doubt the darkest movie I have ever seen. But it is spectacular.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the soundtrack, the music, the setting are all incredible and Oscar worthy. But where the movie stands out is Phoenix's acting. It is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen. He is gripping, dark, terrifying and sad. If he doesn't win the Oscar, something's gone wrong. I'd watch the movie for him alone. The process he went through to prepare for the movie transforms him. Truly stunning and an incredibly gifted actor. "
5692," Film of the year!
"," People will remember this joker for long long time....<br/><br/>I think this movie will be nominated for three categories:
<ul><li>Best Actor</li><li>Best director</li><li>Best picture</li></ul> "
5693," Modern day classic!
", A must see film. I could see Phoenix playing the Joker in Batman films for years to come! 
5694," I registered just to write this review.
"," Whatever critics might say and whatever we might have missed in the movie that could downgrade it in anyones eyes is truly not important - a movie is made to make the ordinary viewer captivated, interested, mesmerized, not impress the critics with unnoticable details - and it does just that. Purely genius. When you have a movie where a mentally ill guy is doing slow dance moves with calming music in the background and you just cant take your eyes of it is is when you know - a masterpiece is born. Captivating, mesmerizing, with a deep thought. If a movie can make you think about the important things in life and about the way people become who they are and simpathize with anyone, no matter what he does, that movie deserves a high reward. Brilliantly done, and if JP does not get an oscar for the performance, Oscar ceremony should reconsider their rating standarts. Youre missing a lot out if you dont see the movie. Litterally perfection. "

Joaquin Phoenix done the the great job trough the whole story. he is living with the character. when i was in the theater, a girl next to me, she whispered, oh! she has given her mercy on the great enemy joker! After watched this movie, i really felt he is not an enemy anymore! "
5697," Modern Classic
"," This movie is an undeniably a modern classic. Phoenix acting is top class, as is Todd Phillips directing. The movie weighs heavy on the audience and is by design difficult to watch at times. The scene in the bathroom is the highlight of this movie for me.
There are a lot of layers to this movie, as it dares to be different from others in its genre.
A perfect rendition of the age old character! "
5698," Extremely well acted and disturbing
", I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that made me feel so engrossed during and also so depressed afterward. Yet I feel it must be seen to witness some of the best acting I've seen. Joaquin Phoenix was incredible. The story slowly builds and is not an action film. My daughter and I saw it together and we both felt the same. We gave it a 9-10 but said we didn't think we could watch it again due to how sad we felt afterwards. 
5699," A Great Return to what Made DC So Great
"," DC was my favorite producer of films back in the day of ""The Dark Night."" Their attraction to dark realism was fascinating, and it contrasted splendidly with Marvel's approach.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, DC got stuck in the rut of a constant need for useless comedy. The movies dragged on, filled with boring, flat characters, bloodless ""fights"" (which were really just flashing lights on a mostly black background), and really poor attempts at comedy. The need for the movies to be appealing to children didn't help either.<br/><br/>In this film, there are certainly some vaguely comedic elements, but the overall theme is dark and suspenseful; there is a constant tension present, which, along with the amazing titular character (acted beautifully) made this film truly spectacular. "

5701," Give Joaquin the award now!
"," We've had some incredible actors play the Joker. After Heath's performance, who would have thought someone could bring something better.
Joaquin does that and more. Mainly because the movie fall solely on his shoulders. He takes us with him on a journey into madness. You hate what he does, but you feel for him and almost understand him.
The negative hype is overblown. The movie is not as violent as we've been lead to expect. Taxidriver was worse, but we live in such a politically correct world, that even art is at risk of being ridiculously filtered.

Only the way he runs is a masterpiece by itself. "

The rise of joker (which I will call it) sent shivers down my spine where someone with his unique condition can blend into society and trigger at the perfect moment - that being on the chat show which I won't reveal starts a frightening revolution against the rich.
This should be marked as the Iron man of the a MCU where everything from here needs to be at that level of performance. This CAN be the start to of a brilliant timeline which would work.

"," The last line says it all: ""You wouldn't get it"", Arthur (Joker) tells the quizzing psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum when she asks an incessantly laughing Arthur what the joke is.
True, it will be joke less understood by the more privileged 'normals'. Because its meaning resides in the darkest corner in the mind of a tormented life. Director Todd Phillips ably supported by Joan Phoenix makes a valiant attempt to fathom it's meaning in this marvelous odessy called 'Joker'.
The plot and its characters revolves around the Joker in a mesmeric manner, unravelling his mind through a script so lucid. Certainly a movie that will be listed among the best of Hollywood movies. "

"," So..First of all I want to say that I am a reallly big fun of the dc villain known as the joker. Before I start my review and say my opinion about this movie I want to say that every actor that got to play the part of the jocker was different from each other and people need to understand it. The point is that each actor is good with there on way and also you cant compare them because the different stories and directors. But who I did prefer as the joker?Heath ledger is the answer but Phoenix was really good also. Have to say that didnt like Jared Leto acting..That's my opinion and that's all. Lets start...First of all I really enjoyed the movie and it didn't let me down and it was keeping you intense from the beginning till the end. And i think is one of the top 5 best movies in 2019. Now let's analyze every part separate.
Acting: Well,what to say about that acting?There is not much to say when someone is really stunning like Phoenix. I believe that he was exactly the person who deserved this role and everything was around him like it should be as the story telling jokers life. Watching him act was getting you to think that he is really the joker and he was so into the role that got you anxious sometimes. Also there were moments that I think he reached perfection(some parts as when he danced and when he killed the people). So the conclusion from all of this I give the acting part 9.2 out of 10 as it was all around Phoenix and didn't let you think about anything else..I will also agree of what people say about him getting the oscar award by saying that he really deserves it but we have lots more movies to go for.
Sound/music:I am going to say here that I personally didn't get really impressed and it could of been better but at some moments was quite good and keeping you intense by the music. So my I give it 7.5 out of 10
Scenery/cinematography/effects:The editing was good like you expected in a movie like this one. The effects could be better but the scenery I mean it was fantastic. There where many great scenes that made you have lots of emotions. My mark is 8.5.
Directing:Well I have to say that is the first movie of Todd Phillips that I saw and it's not a comedy..reallly I dont know if he has other kind of movies. The whole of the directing was great and I think was covering all your expectations and didn't let you down. Is that kind of movie that in the end you will go and check who directed for sure.
Writing/dialogue:Now the writing pit with the story and dialogues fit it really good but they where kind of some moments that I would say way the hell did he say that but you need to understand that you cant understand the character and that he lives in his own world.
Finishing what to say that the story line added really well in jokers life story and batman's(especially). And also it was good plot as it applies at dc universe. He is my favorite villan character and I think this movie was exactly what I wanted and didn't let me down at all..My finishing mark of the whole movie I would give it 8.3/10.. "

Excellent, respect, fabulous... "
5740," Beautifully shot... if a little coincidental
"," Beautifully shot with excellent lighting, this film certainly goes all out on visual pleasures. Joaquin phoenix puts on a strong performance as Joker, taking influences from The Machinist and Taxi Driver. Music score is done really well and they don't force Gotham down your throat - it's clear that this is its own film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film felt a little ""too good to be real"" - With lots of ""coincidental"" plot elements to establish the Joker, I found myself rolling my eyes a little and saying, ""C'mon, really?"". Perhaps this could have been avoided if the film was a two-parter? But other than that, an enjoyable experience. "

5743," 10/10
", Very artistic film that leaves you feeling some type of way upon leaving the theater. 
5744," Masterpiece.
", The perfect film. Phoenix is amazing. If this film doesn't win an Oscar then what world are we living in. 
5745," Mixed bag at best
"," I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of comic books, nor their movies. I thought Martin Scorsese's recent quote about them ""not being cinema"" is dead on. I thought this film, based on the buzz around it, would be the redemption. It wasn't.
As I write this, I see the top posted review says the storyline was unpredictable. That just isn't true, most elements of it were totally predictable. Such as the hallucination of romance, and they go so far as to insult the viewer and spell it out for you later on that it wasn't real after all (duh).
Robert de Niro is wasted in this film (no pun intended), playing a 2 bit late night host, with a catch phrase so bad it seems right off of some youtubers channel. For how weak that role was, they could have gotten anyone else to play the part. Once they set up how much the show meant to Arthur, I figured it was a given he would seek revenge on Murray for showing his awkward clip from the comedy club. I feel they only showed Arthur putting the gun to his chin as to not completely reveal that he would shoot Murray instead.
That Joker so easily finds Wayne's house and lures a young Batman within arms reach is a bit much. And then Wayne isn't on edge at all when they meet in the bathroom later, surely knowing this man had put his hands on his child and choked his guard. For such an important character to the universe, Thomas Wayne leaves a bit to be desired. Even to the last, as his half assed plea to the shooter in the alleyway has no sign of desperation about it at all.
Arthur Fleck is a twisted individual, another victim of child abuse &amp; mental illness, who breaks after being pushed too far and becomes his own personal vigilante. I dont feel like there was anything that new or fresh here. The last scene even felt tacked on and could have been left on the cutting room floor. Disappointing. "
5746," A Tragic Tale of a Man's Route to Insanity
"," Joaquin Phoenix gave an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of the Joker is really masterful (maybe up there with Health Ledger's performance but I guess the world isn't ready for that comparison yet, time will tell!). An utterly disturbing performance, at times makes it pretty uncomfortable to watch. I mean DAMN! This is a troubled character. Often pushed down by the dreadful environment and the people around him. And it gave a lot of answers to the Joker's origin story - which has always been so mysterious.<br/><br/>This film got me thinking. It's a film that doesn't shy away to depict some triggering issues of society. Mainly mental health and violence. It leaves a pretty glaring amount of thought once the credits start to roll; which is saying a lot given not a lot of comic book films make me feel that way. "
5747," Joker isn't a joke.
"," The movie is overall dark, haunting and poetic, cinematography and editing ads more feel of terror and depression to it, portraying the darkness and ugliness of society. Jaquein Phoenix's performance is incredibly terrific and disturbing, from being a struggling party clown to a super villiain/hero creating chaos and fear in the city. The making is absolutely amazing giving a poetic and philosophical aspect to the movie. Unlike other superhero/supervillain movies this movie is more engaging by its spin chilling performance, thrills, suspense and twists and not by action sequences in fact there's no action in this movie. The hallway and stairs scenes are very symbolic portraying struggles and conflicts of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Rating - 4.5/5 "
5748," A Joaquin Phoenix masterpiece finally!!
", Everything is perfect about this film. Only thing that could stop Jaoquin Phoenix from getting his first oscar in this year is probably another masterclass performance that you will never see. 
5749," The movie shows the heart of the joker but not the mind
", The one reason that makes this Joker different from Heath ledger's is that this one thought and acted from heart where as the Dark Knight Joker did from brain. 
5750," Best movie I've seen in a long time
", I went in not expecting anything but a movie about a batman villain but what I got was an amazing movie about a mans descent into madness due to the world around him<br/><br/>It had at least one moment so tense I almost held my breath and another where i had to pick my jaw up of the ground<br/><br/>Only thing I want now is more of Joaquin Phoenix as Joker 10/10

5752," Excellent
"," This is a great, honest film about mental illness and societal isolation. Brilliant cinematography and a beautiful performance by Joaquin Phoenix. This comic-inspired film is unlike any other, which I believe explains some of the disdain towards it.

I belive they set the tone perfect throughout the entire movie. I truly think that they have the perfect set up for an extremely interesting cinematic universe that may be able to compete with MCU. Although its much darker than anything Disney will bring to the table I can only hope it breeds competition!

"," Despite my gut feeling, I allowed a friend to drag me to this opening weekend.
Sometimes it sucks always being right.
Is it dark? Yes.
Is he psychotic? Yes.
Is it done in the fashion that has always made The Joker the most compelling and enjoyable character in the Batman universe?
Not even close.
The casting of Phoenix was almost as bad as Jesse Eisenberg as Lex in Dawn of Justice. On top of that, honestly, you get a better origin story by watching Batman: Under The Red Hood (Which is amazing). They almost bring it together by the end of the movie to make it a palatable storyline, but they still don't quite make it. This movie was exactly what I was expecting it to be: No Thanks.
Any rating over a 7, is complete horseshit.
Don't believe the hype.

5763," The Change of Cinema
"," Joker is a great example for analysing this complex, melancholic, bitter character who is looking life with a different perspective and misunderstood for most of his actions. Very much similar to Travis Bickle, the disturbed lonely character from Taxi Driver, Arthur Fleck is a character that you will emphasize and observe all along the movie.<br/><br/>I believe, this movie is not just an act against the mainstream superhero action flicks but a rebirth of dexterity and complexity in cinema.
With an incredible acting of Joaquin Phoenix, Joker will haunt you and also will put a smile on your face at the same time.<br/><br/>8/10 "
5764," I hear some people find this provocative. Well good!
"," Well, that means Todd Philips and Scott Silver has written one hell of a story. Art is provocative. And it should be. That's the way it is. I am glad Warner Bros is a big company making some original piece so that some money can be invested in relatively high budget arthouse project. It may not be perfect or the best movie but it's a significant milestone regarding the superhero movies that came out so far. The same reason people liked The Dark Knight. Quality writing is always appreciated by the audience.
But I think relating this movie or the Joker character to the up-to-date political discussions is nonsense. We have to think about the concept of a character who is oppressed and bullied not only by society but also by his close friends. Plus he has health issues.
Those people should watch There Will be Blood and see a really bad-guy perfectly crafted and studied head character. What will they say about Daniel Plainview? I wonder really. "
5765," Absolutely amazing. Don't believe the media,.
"," This movie is getting so much hate from the media. Believe me, Do not listen to the media. Just go and watch it. Then you will see it for yourselves. This is one of the best movies so far this year. This might be one of the top 10 or 20 movies of all time. However, you like it. Great acting, storytelling, cinematography, directing etc. Again, Don't believe the media. Many other movies are more violent than this movie, yet the media chose this because they are too woke. Let it be like other movies. Let Hollywood or any other industry alone, media. You guys are doing nothing but proving yourselves wrong. Go watch it. 110% recommend it. "
5766," I LOVE this movie!
"," This is the movie I have wanted to see my entire life. If you haven't seen it yes, do yourself a favor and go. I saw it twice so far and am planning an unprecedented (for me) third theatre viewing. Never in my life has a movie left me feeling so exhilarated and alive.

"," Top notch acting from Joachim Pheonix! It is milles better than the overrated Heath Ledger!
This is the real Joker for me! If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this role, it means Oscars are just bad comedies! The movie start slowly! We find out the past of Arthur: a veeeery dark and scarry past! The final 30 minutes are maybe the best thing i have ever seen in a movie! When the transformation is complete and Arthur really become the Joker, we will see his evil potential! There are some cool and gruesome violent scenes, a little bit of humour! Drama, dark, scarry! The music in the movie is amazing! This movie alone is better than the entire marvel/disney Universe! "
5770," I din't find this movie FUNNY! at all.

In the era of CGI this movie is a standalone example how good movies are made. A collection of moments that brings back your darkest, nihilist desires.

The acting was great and it really gave a good insight as to how the Joker came to be. In some cases it actually made you feel sorry for the Joker. I highly recommend this movie. I gave it a 9 because it is a little slow moving. I guess this makes it better to understand though and the director chose to take his time to build it up. "

The movie has the audience really connect to the Joker. By that I mean we all want him to get bigger and badder with every emotional scare that is inflicted on this guy. He is a representation of a broken system and the worse case scenario of what could become of any human, of us, when the chips are down. Beautiful performance. I want to watch it again "
5783," Dark,Intense
"," Joker is a great movie with amazing acting ,screenplay and soundplay. It makes your inner psychopath comes out. It has a good story but the it had no heavy dialogues. People still remember the dialogue from the old joker and use them as quotes. If this script had such dialogue it would be remembered for decades. "
5784," Beautiful
"," Everything people are saying about this movie is spot on. It's fantastic. Well written, well acted and we'll directed. go see it! "
5785," A devastating and raw Masterpiece
"," This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. From the very beginning, you can feel the misery and violence that Joker is experiencing and how the society is totally f%#*ed. I love the way the movie portrays color, especially the same Joker make up. It seems so vivid in a depressing and wash out environment. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is totally epic. The way he moves, he speaks, he laughs, he dances. It's like he has been the joker since ever. The level of violence in the film is genius. Sometimes you see the character as a poor person but sometimes he seems totally crazy and dangerous. The best part for me is the way the movie gives you some tips and clues for you to make your own conclusions about the story. And finally I feel very identified with Joker in the part he recriminates society and authorities about their hypocresis and the way they see poor and Middle class people as we are objects inside the system and they think they can tell us how we feel or how to be ""successful"" with just some words and no action. "
5786," Joker is, as a critique of the government's handling of mental health and the subsequent social stigma surrounding it, a bonafide masterpiece.
"," I was originally sceptical of the Festival hype surrounding Joker. I was absolutely and unequivocally blown away. Following actors like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, the expectations were high for Joaquin Phoenix - he overachieved. Phoenix's Joker is both similar and different to that of Nolan's The Dark Knight, however it is through the differences that the story really comes to fruition. While the two can be compared in terms of their physical appearance (worn-away makeup, slicked-back green hair), they are, obviously, distinctively separated in terms of their genres, leading Phoenix's portrayal to be one of an extreme introspection, with more revealed, perhaps, in what is not said, but what is shown by the character. Robert De Niro fits seamlessly into Phillips' film as Murray Franklin, embodying the Talk Show Host that America has been familiar with now for what seems like eons. Drawing on the likes of Scorsese's King of Comedy and Taxi Driver, Marty's influence on this film is undeniable. The parallels that can be drawn between Travis Bickle and Arthur Fleck are indisputable, and similarly portray the notion that societal isolation can irreparably damage its victims. This film is unquestionably worthy of its R rating, with scenes evoking extreme violence. However, these scenes serve as essential for the characterisation of Fleck, and are demonstrative of his gradual decay into madness. Those who have seen the film and consider it boring are, perhaps, more used to being overstimulated by the likes of the Marvel movies, in which special effects and CGI dominate over the true narrative. This character study had a budget of 50 million, and, despite the lack of overt effects, is stunning in design. One scene that is brought to mind is before Fleck's entrance onto the Murray Franklin Show, behind the curtain, where Phoenix's unnerving dancing is accompanied by the flawless score of Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir, which is undeniably haunting and serves in itself as a piece of art. While the film itself may not win the Oscar due to the Academy's bias against movies involving comic-book characters (except when there is political motivation), Phoenix, without question is deserving of his first Best Actor, which is surprising after his once-in-a-generation type performances in The Master, Her, and Walk the Line. His performance in this film is indubitably his chef d'oeuvre, and it would be a great tragedy if he lost. Or would it be a comedy? "

"," A dark, sad tale, uncomfortably close to the deepest problems of modern society and implications of unsupported severe mental health issues. Apart from the obvious comparisons to Taxi Driver, avoids all the usual formulae and cliches and will be absolutely unpalatable to anyone who mistakenly wanders in to a theatre expecting more disney-fied MCU/DCEU-shtick, or even some respite delivered through gratifying action &amp; violence. It might still be an origin story in the strictest sense but its as far from a comic book/graphic novel as you could imagine possible. Phoenix' performance is what you should be going for which is a masterpiece in acting. They said no one would ever come close to Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. But they aren't laughing now. "

5799," UNBELIEVABLE CINEMATIC ART
"," Joker couldn't be better. This magistral film is about Arthur Fleck transitioning into the JOKER. This film exemplifies how a society can grow a 'monster' put of a vulnerable person. The character development is mesmerising and Joaquin portrayed the Joker in a way Ledger would be so proud. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the screenplay, the acting and the editing makes this project turn out as something extraordinary that even contains a message that each viewer can understand in its own. It's full of sensations. I didn't know I could experience fury, disappointment, sadness, joy and regret with a just a film, thats why I probably never took my eyes apart from it. With perspective you know what this means to you and what you take of it. For me it means RAW REALITY, this psychological thriller is set in what could be our world with such things as mental illness, injustice, assassinations, chaos and lies.
As said ""Put on a happy face"", I definitely put my happy face when I finished watching such brilliant piece of art.
Definitely think Joaquin and the movie deserves an Oscar and all the hype. "
5800," ""You wouldn't get it""
"," Artistic. Dark. Thrilling. Beautifully disturbing. This is not a flick for everyone. JOKER is NOT a comic book movie. It is not full of action and noise with hero's. This is a deep dive into a mentally disturbed and delusional man who lives in a city that can transform people. But like all movies there is some flaws, the plot is decent (though kind of predictable) and the script is simplistic sometimes. But overall, it is surely a masterpiece. GORGEOUS cinematography, STUNNING score, BRILLIANT acting (I will admit, I did get a little emotional). This movie is an instant classic that has scenes and lines that will stay in peoples minds and make people theorize, watch a second time, and break the movie down scene by scene and try to understand it. And most importantly, it forces us to reflect and have conversations about helpless people who are disregarded or ignored. "

"," This is a good movie. Phoenix(who I generally don't like) is a great actor. I went to see this movie because of course I love the joker story line and character. This movie however if you remove the ""joker"" from your imagination or thought is simply about a man having a mental breakdown. There are a lot of tie ins with Wayne family and etc... but really it's just a movie about a man with mental illness that without a ""Batman/joker"" theme would be just that and not worth a trip to the theaters. I was disappointed. If you are a just a regular fan you will be too. If you are a super super fan/follower you will find any excuse/reason to say it's great. At the end of the day it will be watched and get awards but if you remove the words Joker, Gotham &amp; Wayne it's just a made for TV movie with a great lead actor. "

"," Just watched Joker. Joaquin Phoenix is mesmerising. Joker reminds us of the imperfections in our society. All you see in the movie is Joker, Joaquin's screen presence is unbelievable. The background score keeps the movie on the edge. Todd Phillips direction is magnificent. Would not be surprised if Joker sweeps all the major awards....<br/><br/>We all have a joker within us. "
5814," Every man has his limit
"," During the first half of the movie, I have mixed feelings about the storyline. It looked like the character did not have the Joker's traits at all. But, when the plot took a dark turn, man... I can only think that every man has his limit. Then the character evolved into the Joker that we all have in mind. Great movie. I was satisfied. "

"," I know people are saying this is a masterpiece, and it really is it's fantastic and I loved watching it, but it is a slow movie and there are times that I did look at the time because the buildup is so slow, and the misdirection will leave you wondering it's not much of a surprise, that is to say until the end, it had a fantastic buildup that didn't entirely pay off but was a captivating take on the fanchise.<br/><br/>I think this movie is unique, I think it was something I enjoyed, but for me it just wasn't 10/10 even though I wanted it to be. I gave it an 8.5 mostly because it's not something I'd likely see again but for the sake of the review I did a 9. That's not a fault of the movie in fact I think it does a great job of telling the story so well that you pretty much get everything you need out of it once. I just think a 10 is too high.<br/><br/>I will say you get your money's worth and you will enjoy it but the end for me was almost...idk bitter sweet but still satisfying if that even makes sense. "

"," You're doing yourself a disservice if you haven't already seen this masterpiece. This movie surpassed my already huge expectations tenfold. A character study similar to Taxi Driver, which is clearly a big inspiration for this movie including direct nods to the scorsese film. The critics really are getting it wrong with this one, mainly anyway. One of the best films I've seen in 2019 if not the best. Really will defy expectations set. Really a shock to believe this was directed and co-wrote by the same man who brought us films like The Hangover and Old School. I have a newfound respect for this Todd Phillips and I am very excited in what the future holds for him. Joaquin Pheonix really was the light that brought this all together with his flawless performence of the new take on the origin of The Joker. Nothing much to really say other than his performence will keep your eyes glued to the screen. Masterpiece. "

"," Joker is a movie that absolutely plays with your emotions and delivers an absolutely riveting performance from Joaquin phoenix, on top of that it features a fairly complex plot, an amazingly fleshed out main character, and sole beautiful direction from Todd Phillip's. All in all Joker is a movie that doesn't need to be flashy and delivers its message through subtle scenes expertly intermixed with powerful scenes. "
5831," SWALLOW YOUR WORDS
"," Well balanced, thoroughly thought-out and a living foundation for a first was a 'non rushed' comic inspiration. Development of characters, cinematic masterpiece and acting sensation, delivering a blow to the film industry to be looked upon in the future as an apostle to heath ledgers performance in its own. "
5832," Absolutely Brilliant
"," This film was brilliantly crafted and engages the audience to reflect upon real world issues. Nothing is held back in this gripping tale on a classic character. It's an honest take on who the Joker really is, especially with no Batman around to save the day. "
5833," Joker is great because unlike the films it homages, it goes beyond an ordinary character study by analyzing the interaction between character and society
"," As the twisted character study that it is, I think Joker could hardly achieve its goals much more effectively. Having watched The King of Comedy yesterday in preparation for Joker and having seen Taxi Driver a year ago (incidentally both character studies I liked but didn't think had a lot deeper I was excited to examine, and both were 7s) the inspiration Joker drew from both was obvious, in the shunned-by-society main character of Taxi Driver and the obsession with comedy and a talk show as a media vehicle from The King of Comedy. Where Joker improves on those two quality films is in how it investigates its protagonist: with those you gain an understanding of his basic psychology but makes no broader point, while in Joker you also see how society caused his psychological development.
There are two central components to this: mental illness and socioeconomic divide. As Gotham cut funding for social programs, he lost access to his pills and therapist, and we see him quickly decline into violence and madness without them. He is also on the poor side of a stark contrast between the rich and poor in Gotham. We see both of these manifest themselves repeatedly, making Arthur feel like a worthless punching bag. He figures since he's at the bottom with nothing to lose, he may as well take his frustration out on the people who look down on him and take their spot above him for granted. The criticism that Joker sympathizes with Arthur or presents him as a lovable figure completely misses the mark; it's an extreme cautionary tale about how someone completely neglected by society can feel worthless and become dangerous and unhinged. The idea that the cult following tells people that if you stick it to the man and cause chaos, people will back you up is similarly misguided; that illustrates the prevalence of the feeling of worthlessness at the bottom that Arthur feels. I had the criticism for a bit that it was too extreme and unrealistic - the gap between the haves and have nots is never so clear, and the world isn't ready to embrace such chaos with reckless abandon. All of this takes place in Gotham though, which is notorious for the absolute madness and ruthlessness in the city (which you really know if you watched the Gotham show :), so the extreme setting just illustrates a dark fantasy of how bad things could get if we allowed these gaps in society to grow into such a grotesque shape.<br/><br/>I would be remiss to go further without acknowledging the absolute bravura performance put on by Phoenix. I've always loved his performances and thought he is an all-time great actor even if I'm more mixed on his movies, but this is his crown jewel, a dark and intense film that he gives his absolute all to. The way Phoenix shows the gradual descent from an insecure awkward man to a carefree man embracing violence was exceptional. The film simply would not work without a strong lead performance, and Phoenix is dynamite. I would be shocked if I saw a better performance this year, and Nyong'o and Pitt (in Ad Astra, though I also like him and Leo in OUATIH) have already given quite strong ones. I'll also note here that the oppressive score worked wonderfully for me.<br/><br/>All of Joker's strongest elements that make it a great movie are independent of the fact that it's about the comic book character. Honestly, if it was a similar story about a random person, I think critics would love it and think it's one of the better films of the year and audiences would be very mixed, with some embracing it but some seeing it as darkness without purpose. It's very challenging to give a reasonable origin story to the Joker, but if you were to craft one, I think this type of story explaining not just that he's purely evil but was turned this way by how society cast him out was the ideal way to do it. Plenty of nice small references to the Batman universe, but the only tie in that stood out either way was Thomas Wayne. In every iteration of Batman I've seen up until now, Thomas was hailed as ""a good man"" who always tried to look out for the less fortunate in Gotham and was a wonderful philanthropist. One of the things Joker does so effectively is allow us to inhabit Arthur's perspective, where we see how Thomas looks down on poorer people. Flipping his narrative underscores the flip in perspective from the usual elite, pure anti-crime of Bruce to the marginalized one of the Joker. I still don't think it is about sympathy with Joker, but it allows us to understand another piece of how his persona was forged.<br/><br/>The final thing which is one of the elements that I most wonder about after the movie is: how much of that was in his head? Two scenes we definitively know were fantasy: the first time he goes on the show (which was another big homage to The King of Comedy, where there is exactly the same fantasy by the main character of going on the show and having a blast and then he goes on much later in the movie after going through all he did), and the images of his romance. Especially with the shot of him painting blood on his face and the crowd cheering, followed by him in Arkham dancing with bloody shoes, what was real? That ambiguity opens up many questions, with Arthur as potentially a classic unreliable narrator. Many of the criticisms of Joker miss the intention of showing how society drives him to his actions rather than sympathize with him or glorify his violence. Taken as the dark fantasy character study that it is, Joker is a wonderful and well-made movie. "
5834," Many people feared that this movie would give a mysterious character an unnecessary origin, but I feel like I know less about the Joker now that I've seen it.
"," Joaquin Phoenix delivers a performance that is easily on par with the late Heath Ledger's. From the opening scene to the final shot, I had forgotten that a man named Joaquin Phoenix ever existed. His performance is wildly committed and realistically disturbing. I've never seen a movie so bold, yet so utterly real and believable. Todd Philips has created a fantastic version of our favorite villain, and this movie will be stirring around in our minds for a long time.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten my praise out of the way, I can get to the point. I was afraid that this movie would give too much backstory to a character that is supposed to be a demon without any past. I can put your fears to rest: I know less about this man now than I did at the beginning of the movie. His character is developed marvelously, and so much mystery is created about who he actually is. For all we know, the name ""Arthur Fleck"" is just another joke. "
5835," Goes to dark places most films don't... and is brilliant because of that 9/10 üÉè
"," I have so many thoughts on this film and it truly does take you to places most films wouldn't dare. It takes its time in developing a truly dark, brooding atmosphere and fleshes out the full extent it can take to truly push one to the edge. And those last twenty minutes or so... just speechless. Loved the direction by Phillips, the music, the homage to older Hollywood filmmaking and the brilliantly engrossing character study. Bravo Joaquin - I, and it seems like many people here on IMDb, will surely be rooting for you come Oscar season. It truly feels like his entire career has led to this moment - undoubtedly a performance for the ages! "
5836," Great acting by Phoenix, but 2 major movie flaws...
"," Was a fairly good movie, basically an introduction to the Joker character from his beginning, and Phoenix did some great acting.
I especially liked his dancing, was very funny and well done. Character development of the Joker was well done and explained.
The movie had 2 major flaws though...
First, the story was based initially about joker killing 3 guys with a 6 bullet 38 caliber revolver. First guy he shot one time, the second guy he shot twice, the third guy he shot once in the leg and then followed him out from the Train and shot him once in the back and then three times in the back after that. I can't believe that the producers and directors and actors could do such a poor job to not realize that you can't shoot 8 shots from a 6 shot revolver! WTF??? Seriously?
The second major flaw with this movie is that at the end, Bruce Wayne's father is shot and killed by a fake Joker! Why the hell would they have that happen, when everyone knows that from the beginning of the Batman Story the way it was always told, it was the real Joker that killed him!?! So that was a real letdown, to have the story changed for no good reason. Finally, there was no after movie credit scenes, which was a little bit disappointing, but not the end of the world.
Overall, Phoenix carried the movie, and did a fine job doing so, and I enjoyed the movie, although it could have used some nudity to complete the story. Phoenix will never be as good as Heath Ledger, he was a legend and the absolute perfect Joker, but unfortunately he overdosed and took himself away from us, and Nicholson had alot more confidence and charisma, but I did thoroughly enjoy the performance by Phoenix and recommend seeing the movie, and I look forward to the continuation of the story in the next film beyond this. "
5837," The Best Controversial Movie I Have Ever Seen.
"," Listen, okay. This is the best (controversial) movie I have ever seen. This movie is art and I LOVE it. I don't like people using politics and other propaganda to over cloud their judgement towards this film. Why not just let go of those problems and go see the movie open-minded? We live in a world where good things we love is bad because of feelings and lies. Don't let politics overshadowed art. This film was great for what it is and I love every minute of it.

Also I know Phillips say no sequel but this movie is screaming for sequel it's that good 
5843," For the downtrodden and bullied
"," For me the message in this movie was about how society needs to look at how they through different means can harm the individuals that live in it. One of main examples is bullying shown in different ways throughout the movie. I heard one critic say she saw no point or theme in the movie, and it made me think. I think the movie is a call to society to take a look at what role they play in creating monsters. It is refreshing to not keep it as simple as ""a born psychopath"" and looking deeper into the circumstances.<br/><br/>I connect this theme with how Phoenix played Johhny cash and I know Johnny cash made music for the downtrodden as well. "
5844," An enthralling tragic comedy.
"," An impressive origin story of the Joker which will really make you empathise with the character.

Great acting all round. No issues at all. "
5850," Sadly Joker is overrated - all style and little substance.
"," I was anticipating this movie and loved the trailer, but Joker just doesn't live up to the hype. The movie is inconsistent, shallow and boring. The script is very weak and the directing is poor.<br/><br/>Joaquin has a few good scenes but his character is not consistent throughout the movie. Joker came off more as an intellectually limited and mentally ill loner who snapped because of extreme abuse. This type of character could not become the Joker who is supposed to be a criminal mastermind.<br/><br/>The cherry on top of this mess is the ambiguous ending. I'm not even a comic book fan, and I think this movie should not have been called the Joker.<br/><br/>I would give the Oscar to the Joker's marketing team. "

I definitely recommend this movie to anyone for a fan of the Heaths joker. But just dont expect The Dark Knight, go in open minded and you wont be disappointed! "

The movie is really slow paced till the end of the first half and begins to show all that stress, sadness and suppressed anger exploding in the second half. The final half hour of the movie leaves you in awe as we see Gotham's villain being born. The screenplay and soundtrack makes the film look a bit boring at intervals but it's all worth at the end. Most of the time we get to see close camera shots which captures minute change of expressions and suppressed thoughts behind it.

"," A movie focusing on the origins of the most notorious comic book villian by the much acclaimed 'Hangover' director Tod Phillips is nothing short of a absolute masterpiece! This movie is a primarily a character study of a guy named Arthur Fleck who is facing all kinds of ordeals thrown by life. Joaqu√≠n Phoenix portrays Fleck brilliantly, portraying his vulnerability and at the same time, his demented mind. His portrayal is truly worthy of high praise and it is just a treat to watch his amazing transformation from Fleck to Joker! Also riveting is the cinematography of this film! The visuals depicted of Gotham city are beautiful and come off as individual characters themselves! All in all, Joker is truly a must watch movie! "
5894," Dark, gritty and unsettling but also an imaginatively bold and beautiful origins story of the Joker.
",
5895," Bone chilling performance
"," Luckily, I work at a theater where I was able to view this film early. Joker was a very different film especially inside the comic book genre. With the R rating and extremely dark story it puts it in its own category. Joaquin Phoenix had an amazing performance and is one of the most terrifying characters I've ever seen on the big screen. As always, De Niro delivered on his part as well. Overall great movie and I think needs a second watch to fully enjoy it. "

"," Society plays a key role to shape a person's life, good or bad it still does "
5897," Truly a masterpiece of cinema
"," I was shook at the moment, this probably one of a movie that doesn't rely on cash grabbing but rather to give you a lesson of life, it depicts on how the world turn crazier day by day, and in my own opinion, I think people that somehow get a lot of attention from a couple of groups are more immoral and crazier than people that actually has a mental disability and it's has been proven by this flick<br/><br/>I am in awe by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix, and yet I am here not to compare the performance with Heather ledger, both are equally amazing
The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout, shout out to Todd Phillips
This is going to be revered as a transcending masterpiece of cinema. Bravo "
5898," An autobiography of Joker
"," This movie tells the process of Joker character, formed due to psychic collisions received by Arthur Fleck from the surrounding environment. Also how he faced the facts he received in the hypocritical and self-centered environment. I hope this movie can win the Oscar, especially for Joaquin Phoenix....maximum effort to portray the Joker character. "
5899," I desperately wish that Heath Ledger was alive to state that someone finally did a better Joker than him!
"," what Joaquin Phoenix did in the movie. Starting from his first scene, he simply owned the Joker till the last scene. Joker isn't just a movie, it's an experience that Joaquin Phoenix created in a way that it won't be possible to create it again. Ever. He wasn't acting in the movie, he was living the Joker. The Legend, Heath Ledger, can finally rest in peace now as the world finally discovered an ideal and a most deserving heir to carry forward his legacy. "

5901," A one of a kind movie
", This movie is the most rare film that has got a standing ovation at the end of the movie for a superb performance and story. The justice to the character Joker was done brilliantly. This movie is sick but then it's a brilliant movie. This is the movie you just shouldn't miss watching also you can watch this as many times without getting bored! A well written DC Movie! 
5902," Masterpiece
"," It's really Amazing and outstanding, performance is excellent reallyyyy ,some movie made in the world "
5903," By the end you will be scared of this guy
"," Its hard not to be biased because after all it is a Joker and being a fan this movie already had my attention.Im so glad to see that there is a superhero movie which doesn't rely on its 10 prequels. There has been some controversy surrounding it in the west but here in India no such issue has been bought up and it's really dumb anyways, this movie is not even that violent...but it is uncomfortable because the scenes are done so well and Joaquin's performance is just oscar worthy. By the end you will not feel sorry for the guy or his actions but for the fact that all this could have been stopped if someone actually tried to change Gotham.
The movie is well shot, written and has a really serious tone. Its clearly inspired from the god loved ""Taxi driver"" but not too much and its able to stand on its own. All of the events lead to a beautiful finale which will leave you disturbed and uncomfortable. "

5905," Phoenix doesn't play the Joker. Phoenix IS the Joker!
"," It's my first time to write a review in the site, and what a time to decide writing one. Personally, it's the first time I exit the cinema and I haven't something bad to say about a movie. Even the smallest. It's so weird feeling to know that you witnessed a memorable moment, a moment that maybe you'll have again after many years.
Cinematography, direction, and music are on point in every single scene. Brilliant job from director. Astonishing job from Joaquin Phoenix, he dedicated so much to his act, to his role. You literally forget as the movie goes on who the person behind the camera is.
I'll recommend this movie to every person I know from now on. 10/10 from me, first movie that I give a 10 to. Dark Knight is at 9/10. "
5906," The perfect build up
"," I can't decide what I enjoyed most, Joaquin's performance or the subtle way the main character develops from a shadow to a symbol! Everything fits: the performance, the plot, the music, the whole experience! "

", I just walked out of the cinema and I can't hold my thoughts for this. I need to share my feelings with you. One of the best movies I've ever watched and one of the best performances in the history of cinematography. I can't recommend it more! Also some powerful messages in general. Just wow!! 
5910," Arthur
"," Marvellous movie, direction, sound,characters..
All these are nothing if Arthur's not there..oh my god, wat acting he did, sudden laughing and stopping...he was in a grt pain and saddness inside, that's just erupted...
He didn't wanted to do all that...I think so...
I was a fan of joker in dark night, but this joker is something else.supperbb legend acting by Joaquin phoenix. "
5911," ITS NOT ABOUT A PSYCHO KILLER!
"," Joaquin phoenix,his act is sensational.It starts slow but till the end it makes u realize how much its worth your every penny.Its not about a psycho killer but instead of a frustrated mentally ill person who hates evrything but starts to finally love himself in the end. The last 15 minutes just brings everything together brilliantly. "
5912," It's art that will age well like fine wine!

5913," Very Inappropriate for Kids!!!
"," I took my kids to go see this movie and had to walk out One Hour in After Paying $50 on Tickets and Snacks!!!I thought it was going to be a movie with Batman but this has NOTHING to do with Batman!!! The theater didn't give me a refund and I'm NOT going to take my kids back in to finish it, do not watch this with your kids. I'm disappointed in DC for allowing such a movie to be made!! "
5914," Too much hype
", Joker with no batman is no fun. Just a well made movie of a psychiatric patient. 
5915," Pretty good
"," So lets start with the good. Every actor brings it and the camera work is very good. However, the pacing is slow and the batman ties are completely unnecessary. This movie could have been amazing had they just let it be a story about how to drive a man to be a serial killer. All the joker hook does for this movie is slow it down and bog it down in lore that we already know. Also, who asked for a origin story for a character that has always been intentionally surrounded in mystery? Finally, if you are making a joker central movie then shouldnt we get more than 10 min of joker madness? "
5916," Derivative and cynical.
"," Having given it 24 hours I can now say I have an opinion on 'Joker' for what it's worth.
It's a cynical money grab masking as an art film. It's look,feel and plot are highly derivative of the films Taxi Driver, King of Comedy and a few others mixed in. If you haven't seen those ones it could seem original but it's not. Despite a great performance by Phoenix the film plods for the first hour as you watch a drop of fight club added in to the mix.
Funnily it's when the plot involves other batman characters it shows the weakness of the film itself and the oh so convenient inclusion of the death of the Wayne family into the final act feels added on. It did however make me want to watch Heath Ledger again.
I didn't hate it I just felt pointless. "
5917," Disturbing in the extreme
"," There is no better actor in the world before Joequin Phoenix .Just none
Sadly this film just glorifies disturbing behaviour in the extreme .
Not an enjoyable watch ' although no criticism of the acting
JP is outstanding as per usual "
5918," It's no Joke
"," Hmmm. It's good, phoenix is incredibly good. I just didn't totally connect with an origin story about a comic character that's not a comic book movie. It's hard to explain. I think those two things sit a bit awkwardly. Also the taxi driver influence is clear, not that's a bad a thing. His emaciated frame and gait and posture is painful and Amazing as a transformation, but I couldn't help but think of Christian bale in the machinist. Yep I'm being picky I know. It's good, but I don't think it's the masterpiece is claimed to be. Phoenix will bag an Oscar for sure. I just feel like I'll never revisit it. And it's hard to view a new joker, albeit the most believable incarnation, without thinking about the other screen outings he's had. This again was a distraction. It's good, it's lead is great, although personally I think he was better in you were never really here as far as acting goes. "
5919," NOT Heath Ledger
"," The movie is a nice drama about an ordinary person which has nothing to do with a great intelligent, fabulous, grotesque, narcissist character like Joker. Classic Joker is a master mind, genius of manipulation with human emotions, planning and strategy. Phoenix is a talented actor and shows the development of a sick person what is a great drama, but a drama about an ordinary sick person which can not be named Joker. The issue is not with Heath Ledger who was amazing or Leto who was fun to watch, but the movie as it is - basically it is sad story exploiting Jokers name giving you sad mood and a desire to watch Ledger or Leto again. "
5920," Overrated
", I am a DC fan but this movie is a art house movie pretending to be a comic book movie. Boring and drawn out. 
5921," Joaquin Phoenix makes something out of basically nothing
",
5922," Painfully Brilliant
",
5923," ""Joker"" Wasn't What I Expected
"," Todd Phillip's ""Joker"" is a super villain origin story I didn't quite expect. With elements similar to Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The King of Comedy"", this gritty character study of Arthur Fleck is something more than just a standard Joker villainous tale. Although it's conclusion and plot choices are not to perfection, this was a solid film overall. "
5924," Joaquin Phoenix is unbelievable,,mind blowing performance
"," Joaquin Phoenix is out of this world, very good film but not the greatest film ever. A little disturbing in places. Very clever film. Lots of nods to other similar ish films like taxi driver, psycho, king of comedy, clockwork orange. Thought provoking. Didn't live up to the hype personally. Todd Philips did a great job and I hope does similar stuff in the future. "
5925," Joaquin Fantastic...Movie just average
", Many will rate this move higher simply based upon Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Without him its a flop as he hides an average movie at best. Sorry Joker fans. 
5926," Joker
",
5927," A very non-original origin
",
5928," It's fine
"," Feels like it's in an odd place where neither art house or comic book movie fans will especially like it. I enjoyed it, I maintain a 6 is a good film, and this is a good film. It's not brilliant but it's certainly not bad. Phoenix Is excellent, as is the level of discipline shown toward fan service and it's nice to see a ""comic book movie"" which has some craft to the cinematography. For all the good things Marvel Studios has given us, memorable cinematography isn't something that's ever really troubled them.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it gives mental health an even bat. I need to think more on that. I do think accumulations of an incel fantasy are well and truly wide of the mark, if anything it exposes the man behind the curtain of extremists movements.<br/><br/>It's good. Give it a watch. "
5929," A Big Laugh
"," Last night I went to watch the movie ""Joker"". While ten minutes in the movie I started feeling bored by useless and continuous laugh of the main character without specific reason. That continuous hammering of a laughing sound made me started to think that I have wasted my money and time to get out of the house and get really I mean really bored. The lighting in the movie is dark as I was watching game of thrones season eight. The movie was below my expectations as the Joker character shown in the movie ""The Dark Knight 2008"" was much better than this person was and it really ruined the movie. No action scene no fighting scene simply nothing worth watching in the movie. I am disappointed. "
5930," Very disappointing
"," It's not even a good movie, it's just ok, definetely not worth of such a hype. Phoenix couldn't even actually act, but just make impressions of his own charater. "
5931," Humm, something funny here......
"," While the acting and the actual movie was great in it's own right, this was not the Joker, not even close. The joker is not a weak person, nor is he dumb or a coward, which he is in this film. He's got a knack to feel human weaknesses an act upon it. This Joker was a poor little thing you want to pity. Unable to defend himself (You're kidding right??) full of self pity, in short a looser. Well, sorry to say, but that's a different Joker altogether, if Todd Philips wanted to make a movie about mental illness, why did he pick a Marvel character? But most of all, the previous Joker characters were funny, unhinged, but funny. Heath Ledger was amazing because he could be funny and chilling at the same time (My father came at me with a knife, looked at me ¬´ why so seeeeerious..... ¬ª) . Joachim Phoenix character was so boring and lame, he did not have a single redeeming action, you never feel him in charge in the whole movie. And that's tragic for this character, please Mr Phillips, leave those characters alone and create your own. "
5932," Robert de niro steals the show
", I'm a big joker fan. I was expecting that the movie would have told the story of how an unsuccessful depressed comedian has become joker. But script has not convinced me. Maybe the movie should have been longer. 
5933," Good, but a masterpiece? Not so much.
"," Its funny how some think this was a masterpiece. It was good but far from a masterpiece.<br/><br/>You can already tell Martin Scorsese had a big hand on the direction Joker was aiming for by just watching Shutter Island, which was way better. If anyone says this was 100% Todd Philips interpretation of Joker that would be a joke on its own. No pun intended.<br/><br/>Great direction, performances and awesome crew. Absolutely commendable but a 10/10 not so much. Needed that extra ""something"" that an audience was yearning for. "
5934," Definitely not a movie that people will talk about for years, but not bad
"," I like how the movie humanized the Joker, showed all the steps necessary to make a ""monster"". It was a painful process but you'll see it's not as supernatural as you would think. "
5935," Super Overhyped and Bland
"," As I saw the reviews and the trailer for the movie, I thought I was gonna be in for a good or at least decent movie, but I must say, this was a huge letdown. The whole movie felt like just a backstory movie, leaving everything hanging and not really elaborating on the character himself. The script was poorly written and to sum up the movie, I would say ""Who cares"", and how does this effect my life. Though the action was pre tight. "
5936," Communist revolution glorified
", Unsuccessful people violently deprive property from the rich... 
5937," A nice looking mediocre film
"," Joker is worth watching because of beautiful Cinematography, Production Design, Costumes, Makeup etc. Joaquin Phoenix has given a great performance as a mentally ill person. If the film were simply about a mentally ill person, it would probably be a very good film. However, tying it into the Batman Universe hurts the film immensely. The Gotham and Wayne aspects of the film distract from what is otherwise a decent film about society and personal struggles. "
5938," Watch Charlie Chaplin films instead
"," Nice acting, indifferent and repetitive plot and directing.
Last minutes cannot save the whole film. "
5939," Not impressed
", I saw the reviews and gave it a go. Apart from the fabulous acting from all concerned the rest of the film left me dissapointed. Just like to say joauqin phoenix deserves best actor Oscar next year.. 
5940," Over hyped yet really disappointing
"," The only good thing about the movie first: Joaquin's performance is just brilliant and definitely et par with Heath Ledger's. Other than that there was nothing redeeming about this picture: the story is flat, story pace is unstable, directing does not raise above gotham centered TV series and worst yet is the heavy and overwhelming use of music! Sentiments and feelings in every scene is pushed down audience's throat with unbearable music. Anyone who, honestly, loved this movie upon watching it again will be disappointed with how receptive they have been to popular hype. Joker at best is an OK movie, no masterpiece, nothing new or original under the bat sign... "
5941," could be better
"," 1st ""Joker"" is not a movie for most audiences, it also includes those who read the comics
2nd there are dubious choices in the script, especially in the 3rd act, who saw will probably know what I'm talking about
3 ¬∞ The essence of the character is not in the movie
4th Thomas Wayne was completely misrepresented
5 ¬∞ Wrong to put the murder of Bruce's parents indirectly linked to the joker.
I wish I had liked more, but my view as a reader prevents me. I just can't agree with a hero joker and a Thomas Wayne who calls the people ""clown"".
If you consider the movie as a story based on no batman character, it gets almost flawless, the camera framing, the entire cast acting, the soundtrack that speaks to the movie, the characterization of the 80's and so on. The problem was putting the joker in the story.
There is a little plot twist in the middle of the movie that references Pumpkin's delusions in ""The King of Comedy"" and the revolver that is pretty much the same as the one used by the protagonist of ""Taxi Driver."" I don't need to talk about De Niro's role (being the presenter rather than the comedian) and the joker that Phoenix presented.
The problem is in the third act and lack of creativity of the script that prefers expected solutions over something unexpected. There should have been a clash of ideas, from the joker representing an almost villainous revolutionary spirit against a conservative and peaceful view of Thomas Wayne, but they preferred to turn Thomas into an arrogant elitist and the Joker the father of the poor. There is no criticism among the population itself about what the joker did, ALL the people are in consensus that murdering 3 rich young people was a good thing, and the only excuse for this is why the people were suffering because the rich were also suffering from Gotham's health crisis, that's the first thing mentioned in the movie.
And honestly, why did Thomas Wayne decide to go out with his family the night in Gotham without any security, even with ALL the rejection of the population? That's the problem with elevating Thomas's death to something epic that engulfed Gotham's political fate (Bruce Wayne alive in the end is meaningless if you look at the killer's motivation, of course). It's a very clich√© Manichaeism from start to finish. But it's a 7/10 grade movie. Phoenix will probably win best actor Oscar<br/><br/>Edit: There is also a scene where Arthur's co-worker buys him a revolver, this is not very well explained, it is not implied or explicit why you gave the gun, especially when you understand that Arthur despised him. It looks like something thrown by the script, where it asks you to just accept what you saw "
5942," WoW!!
"," Has to be the best movie I've seen in years.
It has the feel of Taxi Driver (De Niro).
Joaquin Phoenix is just superb, he plays the part so well.
The movies pace is just right, you watch a crazy guy that is also a nice guy become slowly criminal, and what the movie does is make you understand and empathise with how it happens.
I want to see this movie again and again. "

"," Just watched this movie, there is not one actor in this movie that did not do the greatest job ever in selecting the raw nature and origin of the joker. joaquin Phoenix was absolutely the best at getting the joker just right, right there with Heath ledger they both did an amazing before and after piece of work, not going to give any spoilers, but this movie also absolutely depected how higher society treats the little guy, I swear I teared up a couple of times because I know how it feels to get beat down when your already down, had me at suspense every twist and turn, my jaw dropped and I had OMG moments almost every ten minutes, if you have ever wondered how the joker ever became the joker and you love DC comics the writers and producers did the best job of any comic book to screen ever, and I'm not even a comic book freak I'm just a regular girl who took some time to watch a great movie. after this I don't even think of the joker as a villain anymore, just a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the saying goes!! Please watch this movie!! "

"," After seven this masterpiece yesterday I've been struggling to write a review, simply for the reason that the film is so good and I have to write a huge text. Anyway I have to write and need to share my perception.
The film is great, I love obviously the acting, the directing, set decoration, lightening, photography and principally the music. But all the technical aspects it can be easily appreciated while you watch the film, I want to share more about the message and the feeling the bring film. Todd did a great job swinging the mood of the film bringing you sadness, anger, joy, relief, satisfaction. The critic for our society is on point and principally the fact we do not give a hand for each other, do not have empathy on most of cases, until someone get recognition or gets the spotlight on your head, than there as Arthur says, ""we laugh because the system tells its funny"". Just then we have voice, the film shows how we do not appreciate the ones around us, and how we do not stand a hand for each other to group up and fight for the right. We all as humans just let things get out of control. Like it's always happening in our history. "
5948," One of the Best movies i've ever seen.
"," Joker is simply amazing, the way the character develops through the movie is perfect and part of that success is thanks to Joaqu√≠n Phoenix and its unforgettable performance.<br/><br/>Also, i want to remark the way they made us feel pity for Arthur because he is nothing but a man with a mental illness that has been mistreated for the society and people around him.<br/><br/>Last but not least i have to mention the soundtrack and cinematography of this movie that are as good as the rest mentioned above.

5952," One of the best movies of 2019
"," Honestly I was already expecting it to be great, yet i think that the choice of the casting was what made it big.
For starters, i consider that the crucial piece that held the whole thing was Phoenix's performance that is more then 10/10.
Yet i thought that the development was not more then an 8. I find the screenplay quite good, the story is well developed but there is a certain ""slow paceness"" that doesn't allow me to say that the atmosphere was overall as tense as I expected. But as I said the movie is great.
There were, in my opinion, some scenes that were a bit off. With this I mean that they don't really match the tone of the movie.
To sum up, and I think i said it all, the movie is a 8.5/10. Great performance, good directing yet not amazing, and a good representation of the character, with a very distinct take compared to the previous adaptations, which left the comedy behind and introduced madness into the ""comic book world"".

"," Okay, let me start with this - I fully understand all the hype surrounding Phoenix and Phillips - the acting, the directing, everything is extraordinary. But one thing that is not mentioned enough, and seems like thrown in the garbage, is the story of the Joker. Very few people talk about the story and those who are talking about it take it as a terrible story, with a huge gap in the storylines, and in the ages between the Joker and Batman. BUT this is exactly what makes the story perfect. Let's start with the facts:
<ul><li>The Joker seems to be like 40-50 ages old, and Bruce Wayne is still a kid - this makes the Joker at about 70 years old when those two meet in the future.</li><li>Bruce's parents are not killed in a rant but in a quiet night, after watching a movie.</li><li>Bruce's parents are not killed by some guy wearing a clown mask but by a poor man who killed them just to rob them.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, this looks like a huge plot gap. But let's look from the other perspective, which was shown in the last scene - the whole movie was actually what Arthur had in his head - nothing of this really happened. He is just put in Arkham hospital for his mental illness and that's where he develops his Joker personality. Then, we have that rant in Arkham hospital (part of the original Batman story) when the Joker runs away, and in my opinion only then he becomes the real Joker, having already developed the Joker personality in his head.
Here are some facts and questions:
<ul><li>The Joker, both in the comics and the movies, is with unknown history - nobody knows where this guy came from, the only thing that's known is he spent some time in Arkham hospital.</li><li>If all of those things really happened, a lot of people should have known and remember what's the story behind the Joker - especially that he killed a tv host on live tv.</li><li>We were shown in the movie that Arthur has some hallucinations with the girl next door - why he should stop there and not have even bigger ones?</li><li>If the Joker really killed this big guy who sold him the gun, why the little guy, who the Joker let go, did not call the police, especially after his friend was killed?</li><li>And of course, the thing with the clocks - we have 2 clocks shown on screen during the movie, both of them showing 11:11 - the time where the people dream about what they really like. The night show, with De Niro being the host, starts at 11:00. And if we do the math, The Joker kills the host at about 11:11.</li><li>And last, the story itself - this movie IS DEFINITELY related to the DC Universe and the Batman movies - there is no way it is not related when we have Thomas and Bruce Wayne mentioned so many times. Having it related, makes it impossible for having such huge gaps in the plot.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, in my opinion this makes the movie even greater - we have great acting and directing but great story, as well, which is being disregarded, and explains even in a greater way what The Joker really is and what made him become who he really is.

"," What really upsets me the most is the over hype and exaggeration that happened to this movie! Putting this aside, the movie was really good and to a person who has been a Batman fan since the mid-2000's it scored 9 outta 10. Heath's version/take on the clown prince of crime was more perfected and executed but still no one can really judge Joaquin's until he earns a bigger shot/take in a Batman movie.
The laugh was Joaquin's strongest suit but he over-did the dancing thing (7 or 8 times to be exact). Voice-tones wise it wasn't fulfilling too in contrast to Heath's multiple voice-tones styles. As a lunatic, Joaquin was a delusionist psychic fuelled by the hatred, cruelty and madness happening around him. The movie scheme, storyline and directory were top-notch, bringing me to Todd Phillips who really deserves kudos for the effort and energy he has put to this film.
As a conclusion, I think the fair score for this artwork is fairly 9/10. We shall wait and see what does the future holds. "

5988," The struggles of Mental Illness and how someone can make a situation worse for themselves without knowing it
"," Joker is a fantastic movie that properly portrays a severely mentally ill person, and shows the rise in power this person has in the influence he has and the downfall of his mental state. The closest thing I can truly make a comparison to would be Death Note (2006), where it follows a Japanese high school student who is a psychopath who manipulates and kills his way into power, gaining more influence by the day, while also displaying his downfall into insanity. Joker isn't a movie trying to make a political statement and is simply telling the story about how this one guy became The Joker. It's unsettling and disturbing but also intriguing and thought provoking, due to how well and realistic is portrays its events. I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie to a audience younger than 16 just due to how heavy some topics are but it's an incredible movie that is also great character study. "

Every second of Joker is perfection and there is not one bit which is out of place, corny, irrelevant or wasted. You feel as though you are in the story and are with Joaquin every step of the way. I agree that I never thought it could ever live up to the hype, yet it surpasses it. Heath Ledger was awesome but this is something else! I feel as though I don't want to ever go to see a film at the cinema again as nothing could ever come close to it. A film that after we saw, we talked about for 2 hours and it was also the first thing we discussed in the morning. Utter brilliance. "

Thanks joaquin "
5993," 1 start raters should probably stick to Antman or Maid in Manhattan ;-)
"," This film is very raw. It's not slow, it's building tension and showing you that Joker didn't happen over night. This man has been abused since he was a child. He has used his laugh as a coping mechanism to get through it since then. Joaquin's performance was so incredible, I have no words. He must of had to go to a very dark place to get into character. Great seeing Robert De'Niro in a different role. All in all a perfect blend of direction and acting. "
5994," A masterpiece
"," Joker is way bolder and way weirder than most superhero movies. It goes long stretches without any action and tries to raise larger questions about mental health, isolation and governmental support systems. Not all of it works. What does, though, is terrific. Phoenix deserves all the praise he's getting. The cinematography is among the best you'll see this year, and I'll be thinking about a handful of scenes for a long time. And yes this movies deserves an oscar. "

5998," Indecisive
"," This is a kind of movie on which there must be a lot of debate. After watching this there must be a constant battle between mind and brain of each and every viewers for sure. Because of the indecisive character this movie portrays viewers will get confused whether they should appreciate this Joker or should hate him. But the story behind this is just a one liner. Then there are constant awkward laughter of the Joker throughout the movie which seems pretty nagging, the background violin is also very depressing and the last part of the movie is also very disturbing. All of these aspects will ultimately leave a dark impression on viewers mind and will make them think. Not for everyone guys......!!!! "
5999," Riveting performance, Fitting origin story.
"," Joker, a character ever immortal, and reinvented, reimagined in several forms and formats is a character explored on several levels, at several points in his menacing career as the supervillain of Gotham City. Characterized by psychopathic cackling laughter, a clever disarming of the Batman's greatest strengths through elaborately designed plots and with a seemingly insatiable army of goons always at his disposal, he is a handcrafted villain for the Batman. But, in this movie, we see not the Joker who is playing to his strengths outwitting the Batman, but the Joker at his very weak early beginnings, unsure of his existence and accepting of societal maltreatment to some degree. Philips' Arthur Fleck suffers from medically diagnosed uncontrollable laughter, at moments inappropriate, gets beaten down by kids on the street, aspires for greatness but is resigned to his existence but is proud of his ability to provide for his mom. The transformation to the Joker we know through an unmasking by masking of sorts is carefully unraveled through an unraveling of Arthur's already fragile life revealing an ever sinister gratuitous Joker. The much lauded Bathroom scene is a pivotal point in the transformation, masterfully revealing a sure footed performer who finally finds the reality of his existence, and the comedy in his tragic life - he felt alive in others' deaths. Death does make more cents than life - as he scribbles in his journal and thus he goes on a killing spree of redemption, and of manic laughter, not because he can't stop; because he won't stop. De Niro pays a homage to The King of Comedy, being the Jerry Lewis of Joker, the have-it-all with no sense of compassion for the commoners, seeing life revolve around his show and himself all the time. And, in confronting him, Joker confronts his own hollow dreams and aspirations, and shoots them down as never to be, accepting his persona and reveling in the chaos he creates, making his world a one in which the mentally ill don't need to smile and be alright, but embrace the madness within. Serving as an excellent origin story, as outlined, the screenplay still takes liberties in that there are some loose threads connecting the culmination of the transformation, and suffers from overreliance on Phoenix's phenomenal performance to get the point home. The music by Hildur Gudnadottir is haunting, and stays lodged in the mind long after leaving the movie theatre, resonant of the sad, but increasingly more assertive titular character. An 8/10 overall. "
6000," Incredible
"," Joker, as a movie, delivers more than everything people expected: amazing acting, a gritty and dark take over the character(s) and a mind touching thriller story. Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips could definitely give Nolan and Ledger a competition. Not only is this an amazing comic book movie, but an absolutely amazing movie which just boggles the mind as it approaches the end. It is definitely recommended for people with such taste. It truly is a masterpiece "

6002," Delusion, Reality and Demented.
"," The movie is beautifully directed, Gotham is very well demonstrated; being filthy, and just a terrible place to live. The score is hauntingly good, slowly builds up over time; and in the final act it just goes overboard-it's just amazing.
Joaquin Phoenix had done an amazing job for such a complexed character.did as well as Heath but meanwhile staying distinct to His (Todd Philips) style.
The movie is very disturbing; there is no doubt about it, there are times where you will have your stomach swimming as you are very uncomfortable with it, I will not give any details at all.
It's shocking, and it will take multiple viewings, everybody will have THEIR own idea of what could or had happen when the movie ends.

"," Am never gonna thank you enough regarding this legendary work ,the effort thats been put in this is so obvious and appreciated, it helped me a lot to understand so many things in a deep way, Joaquin Phoenix best actor ever. "
6005," Just wow!
"," This movie is like watching a slow-motion train wreck as, piece-by-piece, Arthur Fleck's troubled life leads him on an inexorable downward spiral to inhabiting the character of The Joker. Phoenix plays the role of Fleck and Joker in such a convincing manner that his performance is hard to fault. I feel that this movie could only be improved by watching it more than once. Fantastic! "
6006," Joaquin Phoenix is amazing
"," The first thing that i was really afraid before this movie how predictable it would be but it surprise me so much. This movie is clearly the best i seen this year and also the best in a very long time. Before the movie i thought it would be about look how bad it is for Arthur and then because of that became the Joker. But it instead was that with more due to the amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, he give everything in this role and it can be seen. He play him so well you really feel bad for him in first half of the movie and his health and mental disorder. If Phoenix doesn't win a Oscar for this role is a disgrace for cinema. The tone of Gotham City is really good captured , it is dark and gritty. A lot of people live a badly life and it is well captured. The 3 act in the movie is the best because you see the effect of Arthurs killings that didn't was his intentions. For example when he kills the three wall streets guys it was because they are mean to him. But when Thomas Wayne called this people clowns it suddenly start many protests for lower class. Thats a little problem i have with the movie how fast the protest starts but it is not the biggest problem. The protests are in my opinion the political in the movie. With signs like kill rich for example it can be seen as a Socialismen message. But in my opinion it is just a side thing and the real message is about mental health, how a person can became extrem without help from the society. Is about Arthur long story short. On of my favorite scene is when he's on the talkshow and it becomes more intense till he kills Murray Franklin, the acting and dialogue in this scene is really good. After all this is a really good movie and Warner Brothers continue do movies like these in the future , with this they can do a comeback against Marvel. "
6007," Even better than expected
"," For the last few weeks I've been getting a lot of information about this film,some acclaiming the film and others saying it was too much, so that when I got to the movie theater I really didn't know what to expect. First of all I'd like to say that it wasn't as brutal as many make you think ( watched in Germany but in OV), it's more psychological than violent. Yes, it does have a couple of scenes where you say WOW, but it's still because the character development needs it.
A great movie of a character from the DC universe that it's not a superhero movie.
I can only recommend it. "
6008," Believe the Hype, huge Spolier Alert!!!
"," The movie is phenomenal, however incorrect to the Killing Joke Animated movie that original is true to the comic book and the film was inspired from. Joker was a struggling stand-up comedian who had lost his wife and unborn child in an accident, embarked on the robbery of a chemical plant to make ends meet, and fell into a vat while fleeing Batman. The ""Joker"" adaption"" removes the Joker's background as a master criminal and emphasizes that he was a relatively ordinary man who had ""one bad day"" that drove him to lunacy. Two different stories and I'm glad Joker a stand-alone film, but c'mon Warner Brother's stick to one story. Now you have almost all non comic book readers, Animated Movie Go-Ers confused and thinking Batman and Joker are half brothers. WTF SMH "

Todd Phillips andJ Phenix did a great job at constructing a character who is one part biological enigma, one part familial abuse, and one part society recluse without trying to build sympathy for the character. The reason for the unusually low score for this movie is because it holds your hand too much and leaves you with little in the way that is uncertainty.

Different than Heath's performance but still good in its own right. I thought Joaquin did a good job of borrowing a few ingredients and adding his own spin on things.

6045," Joker: A Dark Reflection of Modern Zeitgeist?
"," I don't think I have ever left the cinema feeling quite like I did after watching 'Joker'. The only way I can describe how I felt is shell-shocked. Not because of the violence but because of the disturbingly accurate and poignant reflection of our times.<br/><br/>Joker is technically brilliant. The cinematography is spectacular, and the 80's aesthetic works fantastically. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a career defining performance. He plays the role with an utterly watching and creepy intensity that will leave you on tenterhooks throughout. However, I feel that this film may be a little controversial for a best actor nod. Robert DeNiro plays the Murray Franklin character with a knowing ease and the scene including him towards the end of the film, although obvious, is still very shocking.<br/><br/>Todd Philips reaches new and surprisingly political levels with his direction. I am truly surprised that such a film could even be made in this day and age. The Joker is turned into a misunderstood 'hero' - a result of a broken society. This is a bold move. Philips has a lot to say and it seems he has found a platform to say it. The influences from films such as 'Taxi Driver' and 'A Clockwork Orange' are apparent. It is a return of the character study but with a separate agenda thrown in. I do wonder whether, much like 'A Clockwork Orange' people will be negatively motivated by this film or will people recognise it as a dark mirror?<br/><br/>If I were to side-line the political and social commentary of Philips and look at the piece purely as a work of cinema, I do have a few critiques. The Sophie Dumond character reveal isn't treated very subtly, and it so easily could have been. However, I do understand why they did this for general audiences. The shoehorning in of the Wayne murders was also a little clumsy and in an already busy film, slightly unnecessary, but again I understand this was probably to reassure financers.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that Joker is the most pertinent film of our time. Never has a film so devastatingly represented the condemning and bitter nature of modern zeitgeist. Joker is a film that needed to be made but probably shouldn't have. I realise that this is a total contradiction but, in a way, so is the film and indeed the character of the Joker. I feel torn. I am a huge fan of the comics and the character of the Joker is utterly iconic. The film is masterful but yet I still am left with a bad taste in my mouth. I'm sure with time my opinions will settle but until then I am still in two minds. I have no doubt that this film will be studied and talked about for years to come. "

6048," An honest Joker
"," Whether you loved or hated this film, one thing is true: the Joker doesn't get any more real than this. This Joker is almost everything I was expecting: it's dark, honest and disturbing. Please note that this film is not intended for the average comic moviegoer. If you liked The Avengers, it's very likely that you won't get this film (no offence). The Joker is made for a more segmented (and clever) audience and is here to make a statement. In my opinion it could have been a bit darker and gory. However, it has definitely made an impact and will become the benchmark of many other comic-based dramas to come. Without a doubt, this film is one of the year's best.<br/><br/>Score: 9/10

6061," The story of how the man who has had enough of being mistreated by the system and society descended into The Joker
"," This is a very, very deep movie. Though it can be slow at times, it deserves a 10 just becuase of it's message. We wonder what is going through someone's head when there is a shooting somewhere and how/why they could do such a thing, and this film gives some possibly answers to those questions. It sort of explores how someone with very severe mental illness and deslusions could be pushed to insanity.
Joaquin Pheonix is outstanding. His character, Arthur Fleck is a little slow and suffers from all kinds of abuse throughout his whole life. If that weren't enough, the help he is getting from the state's mental health programs come crumbling down on him. I don't wanna give anything away, but I will say this. As much as people seem to fear this movie, it does carry a very strong message and I hope it is realized by the right people. We can stop people with major mental illnesses from descending into this type of psychotic madness if we only treat them how we want to be treated and allow them access to the right type of help and medication. This is a very realistic approach to the iconic villian. "

6066," Not the DC movie you were expecting
"," When I first saw the trailer for ""Joker"" I was hooked. The trailer brought emotions to me that I have not felt for a while. The trailer in its self is a masterpiece. so after I watched it, it sold me, I was fully ready to see this movie and was sure that it was going to be a masterpiece... And boy was I right. This movie was, in my opinion, more of a psychological crime drama than a DC movie. which I am totally on board with. I read online that this movie had unsettling violence in it. and it did. but I think that most movies just have violence and that they are developed to just have violent scenes. but in Joker, man is that a different story. The violence in this movie is unsettling. and it's supposed to be. this movie is about a psychopath that lives in a terrible world where no one... zero people respects him. Murdering people in movies isn't supposed to make you feel like its a normal thing, and that's what most movies do. this movie made you feel unsettle when murders happened. you know that Arthur is a psychopath because he doesn't think twice about killing people. he just does. every single time someone dies in this movie, its unexpected. besides 3 characters. he just does it. no recollection. just full on murders people because he knows that nothing good ever happens in the world. In his defense, the people Arthur kill in this movie are not really good in there own way either, Arthur makes valid points on killing people. because its what they deserve. And forgive me for making it sound like I think its OK for him to be killing all these people. It still is really bad for him to be killing all these people. This movie overall was freaking amazing, movies like this don't come around often and it's always good to have a refresher. i definitely recommend this movie to literally anyone, i suggest only people 17 and older should see it, this is by all means, NOT A KIDS MOVIE. "
6067," SHOCKING AND IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE
"," Throughout the entire film, I feel pity for the Joker or Arthur Fleck. I was shocked about his mental disorder. He can't stop laughing when he is nervous or depressed. I don't also understand why some people of Gotham City did not respect or help him. People don't understand about his mental disorder. I feel empathy. Due to his experiences with the society and his mental disorder, Joker became violent. He kills people because that is the only way so that people will notice him and it makes him happy. The Joker doesnt know between right and wrong anymore. He thinks only now about his own happiness.<br/><br/>This film taught us that we should appreciate and respect others even though he/she has mental disorder, disease, mental disability, or etc. Do not avoid them but rather, help them to be happy in this world because they are also humans and they belong to this Earth.

"," I can't wait until I watch it again, and watch a second, third and forth part of it "
6074," Dark and gripping
"," This movie starts off slow but honestly it's a borderline spine tingling for the mostly part. The performance of the Joker character was brilliant and you could really see how broken he was and how easy it was for someone like him to turn into such a monster. The music in this film just makes it, it's suspenseful and really ties in with the tone of the film. Let's be honest it's not for everyone, the violence is pretty graphic but that's part of the Joker character. His rant on the TV show is very relatable to society in the real world and makes you sympathetic to his character and his actions in the film as well as the Dark Knight. The cinematography in the film is as good as you will see, from the lighting to the capture of emotion, it's seriously is terrific work. I definitely think it shines light on the issue of mental illness through the portrayal of Fleck (Joker) and how the disease engulfs people who don't get necessary help. Don't go in expecting a fast based action movie like most comic books films, it's going to be slow and bit hard to watch at times but I for one loved it. A criticism could be that the Thomas Wayne death scene was different to Batman Begins but that's just being pedantic tbh. I don't think the movie is for everyone, some people are going to say it glorifies violence or say it is too boring but this is a film that tackles real world issues while also giving the back story to the Joker and the Dark Knight. The acting for the most part is spot on and same can be said for the music and cinematography as mentioned previously, credit to everyone involved does the Joker character justice "
6075," Change the movie of the movie character of the clown to perfection
"," Re-examine the good works of people's dark side. In reality, you and I are all clowns. We only know how to suppress the indifference of humanity from this movie and the bullying of the weak.

6093," Nothing New Here
",
6094," Not a comics film, Not a Joker film
"," Any comparisons to comics movie in a huge mistake. THIS ISNT A JOKER FILM.
This a a dark drama about a crazy person
I was very disappointed. Very.
the movie everything is only two hours but went on forever ... I felt like it was over after 4 hours. I looked at the watch non-stop. So it's true that there is an Oscar for sure. No one will change that. Really exaggerated acting. But he embodies the mentally ill and the actor has lost a lot of weight = Oscar. The movie has no connection to comics for good or for bad. The references to the Wayne family are really forced. The plot is very disappointing. There are tributes here. A bit of Scorsese, taxi driver and a king of comedy , but not the same level, not the same league. There's a small tribute towards the end to the Dark Knight, wondering if you've noticed. And there's a tiny tribute to movies like Sixth Sense / Fight Club. All in all maybe if I count the music score it is worth 5/10 for this movie. "
6095," Great acting, lackluster story, depressing to watch
"," First of all, Joaquin Phoenix was great as the Joker, his acting was spot on.
This is a character piece that explores the downward spiral of a crazy person. The Joker character is definitely not the same Joker portrayed in the Dark Knight series. Heath Ledger's Joker was smart, witty, funny at times and crazy. Joaquin's Joker is psychopathic, depressed, socially awkward and moronic.<br/><br/>In all, watching someone turn from just crazy to a psychopathic killer can be interesting if there's some kind of struggle between good and evil but there is no good guy in the show. If Batman existed in this show, Joaquin's Joker would not compete because he's just not smart or resourceful enough.<br/><br/>I would compare Joker with shows like Taxi Driver, or There will be blood. They're all character development stories but are very depressing and tough to watch. "
6096," Dont understand the hype
"," Dont get me wrong, Joaquins performance is brilliant but thats where it ends for me. This isnt the joker. The joker is an intelligent, homicidal maniac who creates chaos very purposefully, not by accident. Not someone who struggled to string a sentence together in front of other people. It is so slow moving, I almost fell asleep twice. The last 40 mins or so is honestly the only part worth watching. Very disappointing. "
6097," Not that great...
", Joaquin Phoenix's performance was exceptional and deserves all awards this year but the film was average. Things should not be blown out of proportion. 
6098," Let's talk about Batman.
"," Let's diecuss what's not being discussed. The fact that his joker fitting into any description of Batman's joker is ludicrous. First point is joker is about 40+ in this movie while Bruce is 9. That would make joker 55 by the time Batman is even coming into form. Hardly a legitimate rival. Not to mention hat joker in his 40s is a unintelligent loner who couldn't fight his own shadow yet he's supposed to be the yin to Batman's yang? I'm sorry but you don't develop that prowess overnight. Joker is confident, cool, strong, capable, smart, ambitious, a leader, a fighter etc. joker is not this character period. "
6099," The Man who Laughs
"," Let Me start off by saying that when I have a hard time scoring a movie, I refer to my personal scale. I associate each number with a corresponding word/phrase; the scale is as follows:
1 - GOD-AWFUL
2 - Awful
3 - REALLY bad
4 - Bad
5 - Okay
6 - Good
7 - REALLY good
8 - Great
9 - DAMN-NEAR perfect
10 - PERFECT<br/><br/>My starting point with ""Joker"" was a 6 (""Good""); however, once I took into account the politics, comic INaccuracy, and the fact that it's essentially a rip-off of Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"", I settled on a score of 5.<br/><br/>Let's start with politics. Hollywood has it in their head that they're doing some sort of public service by shoving AT LEAST one political agenda down your throat with basically every movie (and T.V. show) these days. Although it was part of the story (and some would argue a ""crucial"" part of the story), there were definitely (unnecessary in my opinion) politics in this movie. The fact that Thomas Wayne couldn't be with Penny Fleck (Arthur/Joker's mother) because of public image; When funding was cut and Arthur no longer had a therapist and medication; When Arthur killed the three Wall Street boys (in self-defense) on the train. This last one's the most important; it's a re-occurring aspect of the movie. Towards the end of the movie (when Arthur's GONNA blow his brains out on the ""Murray Franklin Show"") Arthur points out that if he (or someone in the same social class as him) died, they'd just ""walk over him"", but since three perfect little Wall Street boys died, we should all be in mourning. I won't deny the fact that this is an important aspect of the movie, but again Hollywood thinks we ""need"" politics in everything nowadays.<br/><br/>Onto comic INaccuracy. It's no secret that this movie was never going to be a faithful adaptation of the Joker; however, (as someone who does read comics) I can't overlook the inaccuracies of this movie. Joker has had many origin stories over the years (since many authors have wanted a crack at one of ""the greatest comic book villains of all time""), but the most common is the Red Hood story. Basically he's just a ""normal"" person who has to resort to crime to support his wife and baby-on-the-way when he has a run-in with Batman; this encounter ends with Joker falling into a vat of acid that: bleaches his skin, dies his lips blood-red and plasters a permanent smile on his face. In this movie however, Arthur takes medication (primarily) for Pseudobulbar Affect (P.B.A.), or uncontrollable laughing/laughing at random times. Although this ""makes sense"" for a Joker adaptation, it's NOT comic accurate. May I also just add that Joaquin's laugh in this movie is SO ANNOYING!? Pretty much every scene has random, unnecessary, annoying laughter!<br/><br/>My last point is that ""Joker"" is pretty much a knock-off version of ""American Psycho"". For those of you unfamiliar with the movie (based on Brett Easton Ellis's DARKLY satirical novel), it follows a Wall Street yuppie named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) who fantasizes about murdering people. The book ends with Patrick confessing but you find out it was all in his head; the movie however, also ends with a (REAL) confession but nobody believes him. I bring this novel-turned-movie up because Patrick also keeps a diary/journal with drawings of what he does/wants to do to people, much like how Arthur writes down his jokes and has pictures of naked women in his diary/journal.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I never thought that even Joaquin Phoenix could defeat Heath Ledger and become ""THE Clown Prince of Crime"", but I though maybe he could at least match him. Did he? Performance-wise yes; however, the movie itself was good NOT great. Joker currently has a 8.9 here on IMDb, and (after scrolling through reviews) I've noticed that anything below a 9 only appears ""once in a blue moon"". The two people I went with both give it a 10/10 whereas I gave it a 5; maybe I'm crazy, maybe I read too many comics, or maybe I watch too many movies, but ""That's Life..."" "
6100," One-Line Review: Joker (6 Stars)
"," Despite the hardcore and jumpscare violence, the so-so portrayal of mental illness and its consequences when it goes untreated, the eerie score played on repeat, great dialogues 90% of which are polished as punchlines, the brilliant backstory of the DC universe, and a charming performance (of a life time) by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker was an underwhelming crime drama for me.

"," This is the story of a man with psychic troubles who is a clown hired mainly for publicity jobs. Life begins to become hard for him chiefly when he is fired. He enters then on a confused behaviour which includes a crime spiral. His activity becomes intertwined with the people's social and economic public protests in town. This makes the movie also a one of social protest, and demonstration sometimes publicly violent. The plot relationship between these two aspects of the story is well done and shown in the movie which well acted and directed. "

6106," That's life.
", The film is complete surprise. It's a psychological takedown on one of the best know vilian's bad traits. Whan bad times comes societies can expect bad feelings and deeds to flourish. That's life.

6123," Send in the clowns!
"," Todd Phillip's team has created an instant classic. With slick direction and an intricate script we join Joaquin Phoenix in the birthing process that is Joker. I say birthing process because that is exactly what it is, for both the protagonist and the viewer. It is excruciatingly painful and necessary to endure. Cues of the steady beat from a galley drummer throughout the film remind us we are trapped on this ship and there is no getting off as it bravely tackles mental health issues. Viewers can not escape the uncomfortableness felt when observing the uncontrollable ticks, social awkwardness and misery portrayed by Phoenix as Arthur Fleck. It is no wonder to me why for some this film wasn't the escape THEY needed and therefore left the cinema. Arthur's mental health issues are further compounded by living in Gotham; a city where the rubbish and crime is piling up, social welfare is being cut back and the elites entertain themselves with little to no interest in the poor. Fleck is scraping by as a performing clown and struggling stand-up comedian. Society is literally and figuratively beating him down. Once the state cuts his medication his spiral was imminent. Broken and scared he arms himself and starts fighting back. Staying with the DC universe we follow Fleck's motives and have a glimpse at a world of absent fathers, inadequate mothers and an uncaring government. The two hour allocation for character development is perfect, chopping time off from the beginning would only damage the end result. The addressing of mental health in such a bold manner should be applauded. Todd Phillips is forcing the audience to LOOK at the world, look at what is going on beyond the glitz and glamor of television and feel the seedy undertones of the entertainment we consume.<br/><br/>It is said that comic books have always reflected the time and place they were created, the success of Joker is no doubt due to its parallels with today's world, an ominous harbinger for perils to come. Poverty, mental health and uncaring elites are the melting pot for civil unrest. While Arthur Fleck is spiralling down, conversely the Joker is rising. He doesn't stumble or shy away, he dances in the chaos.<br/><br/>Who is really broken?<br/><br/>If you didn't like this film, maybe you just didn't get the joke. "
6124," Almost Perfect, relies a little to much on some old classics
"," I love this movie and have seen twice in theatres and I plan on taking a friend of mine to it this weekend. This movie takes a tragic situation and shows a dark side of mankind. On display is the raw hate, greed, vengeance and lack of empathy that can destroy a society; it is all on display in a very visceral performance. Joaquin Phoenix at least deserves an Oscar nomination for his unhinged portrayal of a man that would eventually become the crown prince of crime. I only have one complaint about the movie it is minor which is why I can only give it a 9.5. That complaint is that it steals a little to much from ""The King of Comedy"" and ""Taxi Driver"", two movies that I love that only a few in the modern movie audience have seen. It's reliance on some of those scenes telegraphs a few of the upcoming scenes a bit to much for my taste, but if you have yet to see those two movies it won't bother you. Simply put this is a master work of our time. "
6125," The media was wrong.... Again
", Enjoyable movie with great character development and story telling with exciting visuals. Don't worry if you want to go see it you won't need a bullet proof vest. 
6126," An absolute masterpiece
"," This film is one of the best films that I have ever seen, and the good thing about this film is that there are no super heroes, no cgi what so ever from what I can tell, and Aurther Fleck is a very relatable person, who has got a mental illness and nobody in society cares about him.<br/><br/>A lot of people are saying that Robert Downey Jr deserves an Oscar for being in Endgame, but Joaquin Phenoix is the only one who deserves an Oscar for best actor this year<br/><br/>Why is it that low budget films always seem to do much better and have a better story and characters than all the big budget films that the industry keeps pumping out "

"," Just got back from seeing this about an hour ago. It's a pretty solid film with a cohesive plot and some social commentaries. My main gripe with this film is that it spends too much time with the wrong thing. I fully understand that this was always meant to be a character film that shows a person's dissent into darkness, but this film spends so much time setting up that the actual plunge feels lackluster. Small portions of this could've been cut out to shorten the run and further boost the ending (including the final 3min) and the moral of the story wouldn't have suffered. Leads me to believe that they were left in merely for their visual beauty (and this film has lots of truly beautiful shots) "

6140," A Good Movie with a Missing Ingredient
"," Todd Phillips' new film Joker provides a new take on the often nebulous personal history of its titular character. Joaquin Phoenix portrays Arthur Fleck, a man whose social ineptitudes leave him outcasted like so many other nameless people in this film's version of Gotham City. Despite the protagonist's attempts to remain positive throughout the beginning of the movie, his spirits are further afflicted by a persistent, irrepressible laugh as a result of a mental condition; one the film hints at as being the result of past emotional trauma. It is through this that the movie cleverly ties Fleck's condition to the iconic Joker giggling that so many expect the famous villain to indulge in. Arthur's psychological condition, the ill-disguised prejudices of others, and the stigma surrounding the fact that Arthur still lives with and cares for his mother all conspire to induce in him his later criminally misanthropic tendencies.
The thrust of the story is centered around Arthur Fleck's attempts to make it as a standup comedian. Inspired by the fictional late night host Murray Franklin, portrayed by Robert De Niro, Fleck's longing to bring joy to the world is constantly interrupted by the violence inflicted on him by others. Several times throughout the film Joaquin Phoenix's character is assaulted by young hoodlums and ill-tempered adults, all of whom take issue with his profession as a small-time clown and performer. Most of Fleck's acquaintances throughout the film hasten his eventual transformation into the Joker by offering questionable advice and continuing to show him disrespect. All of the choices Fleck makes during the course of the movie eventually culminate in his embodying the id of Gotham's downtrodden masses. After discovering the secrets of his own past that were hidden from him, committing several murders, and successfully cutting himself off from even the few people he was once close to, Fleck's 'Joker' is fully realized and is lauded by a significant section of Gotham's population. The vengeful violence of the clown mask-adorned masses was ignited by Fleck's earlier killing of three Wayne Corporation employees, and the film's 'us and them' dichotomy produces the iconic chaos that the Joker is most known for stirring up.
The positives of the movie are obvious and deserve praise: Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is compelling, and rivals that of Heath Ledger's Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. The appeal of Ledger's version lied in not only his unique take on the character, but also in the lack of knowledge about his specific origins. 'Less is more,' as they say.
Ledger's groundbreaking performance is clearly at the forefront of this film's mind, as evidenced by Phoenix's eventual choice of attire and clown makeup; Arthur Fleck conveniently chooses a look eerily similar to that of Ledger's portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime. This isn't necessarily a criticism of the costume in this film, but rather stands as a testament to Heath Ledger's legacy of what we now expect of a good Joker performance. Ledger's Joker is so burned into the zeitgeist that a return to the look of any portrayal pre-Ledger would likely leave contemporary audiences wanting.
Despite the borrowed look of Phoenix's Joker, this film has a crucial advantage over The Dark Knight in regard to the villain: Phoenix is human, and humorous.
Heath Ledger made the Joker look threatening and in control, as a comic book villain should be. In The Dark Knight, Ledger serves as a more than formidable opponent to Christian Bale's Batman, and the ensuing struggle and dialogue between the two prove to be sufficiently engaging. However, with that said, Ledger's Joker was perhaps too impervious. Able to escape jail via an almost unrealistically well calculated plan, able to match Bale's Batman in hand-to-hand combat, and coordinate a fleet of goons in an attempt to kidnap Harvey Dent, Ledger's Joker had to tap into a level of supervillainy that should be reserved for films with characters wielding otherworldly powers. At the end of the day, the appeal of the character lies in the absence of his morality and the joy he takes in exploiting the malevolent elements of human nature. Ledger's Joker had no time for joking, he was too busy bringing a city to ruin.
In light of this, it appears that Phoenix's Joker is much more nuanced. Joker (2019) explores the more human aspects of the character, and isn't afraid to show the vulnerability of such an off-color villain. While never abandoning the dour tone the film is quick to establish, Joker makes legitimate attempts to engage its audience in a humorous way. The movie will poke fun at its lead character for the sake of getting a laugh just as much as it will try to share Arthur's twisted psychology with them as well. Let's just say that there's no scene in The Dark Knight where its villain bumps into a glass door in front of two law enforcement officials. It's because of this that Joker oftentimes feels more genuine than its predecessors. Not only does it capture those more human elements, but Joker still manages to depict the main character's influence and corrosive view of the world and its consequences. The film ends with Gotham City in ruin, just as it did in The Dark Knight, but not because of one criminal's unrealistically flawless endeavors. Gotham is in utter chaos not because the Joker succeeded in carrying out a masterwork; rather, Gotham falls because the Joker failed. Unable to impress people with his attempts at comedy, Arthur Fleck resorts to trying to prove that life is a farce. He attempts to accomplish this throughout the film by using more and more extreme measures, quickly shifting to murder and crime.
To conclude, I will discuss the 'missing ingredient' as it is pertinent to the Joker's criminal tendencies. While Joker amply demonstrates that Arthur Fleck inhabits a vindictive, sadistic world, the justification for why the Joker resorts to crime is absent. There is a leap from ""these people have wronged me and deserve punishment"" to ""I must murder them"" that the audience is expected to take for granted. While superfluous, I found myself comparing Joker to Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.
While seemingly an esoteric reference, Dostoevsky's work contains what this film lacks. In Crime and Punishment, the protagonist Raskolnikov is a young student living in poverty, who plans to murder an old pawnbroker woman not only in order to steal her money but also because he believes the world would be better off without her. This is the equivalent of Arthur Fleck's feelings of resentment toward those who have abused him. However, in Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov's justification for why he believes murder is justified is clearly explained. Raskolnikov believes that there are some people that because of their superior character, ability, or understanding, they have a right to transcend morality itself in order to bring about seemingly positive change in the world. Raskolnikov fancies himself as one of these superior people, and because of this he feels justified in murdering the wretched old woman. I wouldn't want to ruin the plot to an over 150 year-old novel, but needless to say the rest of the book demonstrates the flaws in Raskolnikov's reasoning and the inescapable weight of moral consequence.
To bring this back to Joker, we are never explicitly shown how Arthur Fleck shifts from malcontent to criminal. He very clearly has elements of identifiable humanity in his character, otherwise the film would fail to leave the emotional impact it does. Fleck isn't Michael Myers from John Carpenter's Halloween, going around killing with no motivation (ignoring the sequels). Where is the Joker's justification or motivation to actually commit these heinous crimes? The ending of the film shows the consequences of his actions, and some may say that his contentment with the results demonstrates his ambition to commit crimes, but what brought him to the conclusion that crime is the remedy in the first place? What does it take for an abused person to go from victim to mass murderer? To say that everyone reaches a point where they 'can't take any more' and simply lash out would be a rather bold statement, considering so many people are abused and yet their conscious inhibits their ability to kill remorselessly. What makes the Joker different from the average person? Again, the film aptly portrays the consequences of the Joker's criminality. However, without a well-defined reason for why the Joker chose to put himself in a position where he's dancing down the hallways of Gotham jail by the time the credits roll, some audiences may feel frustrated by the lack of explanation as to why an outcast would choose a life of crime.
The Joker's trademark is a wake of chaos, yes, but if his motivation is chaos, when is that demonstrated in the film? Is the Joker inspired to create chaos, facilitate vindictive violence, or something else? With this bridge absent between the character's beginning and outcome, the film remains incomplete. As is, it is a well-directed film with compelling performances. However, with this crucial gap in the development of Arthur Fleck's motivations, Joker fails to bring its version of the iconic clown full circle.</div>"

Don't watch it..

This is all about performance, I was amazed by the acting. To play such a disturbed man, to make that laugh your own. I was blown away, no pun intended ;) "
6148," We truly do live in a society
"," But in all seriousness, this movie was amazing. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix.
You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this.
We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him.
There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece.
It had me shaking and disturbed for a long time after I left the cinema, and that can only be the mark of a great movie. "

The plot hold you clearly and its not left you for a second or so. Truely remarkable work the way he laughs brings out more humanitarian joker rather than the past potrayal seen before. "

A beautifully crafted piece of artwork, Some of the shots are worth to be re-watched, Just to feel back the moments of the film of director and the performer. The colour and the props of the picture just brings us the '80s, and the soundtracks used for the main character adds pulse and grip. OST adds another dimension for the film. Phoenix's witty jokes and repeated lines don't bore the audience, In fact, it adds tension at various degrees of the film. Overall a must-watch movie for movies lovers and Joaquin Phoenix fans.

Ok, he's ill I get it, and he laughs uncontrollably, I get it and this was way overused in the movie, by the end I just wanted him to stop freaking laughing! So he gets beat up once, then almost a second time, kills some guys and then is like ok I'll kill my tv comic hero because he said a couple mean things to me, sorry not buying it.

Well I love this dance scene the most, which is a fundamental turning point and great manifestation for an individual to truly find himself and celebrate his identity, in a world that the majority of people cannot embrace his difference and show any kindness. The calling for outside world to have more empathy and consideration for others is one topic, yet a healthy and resilient internal establishment for an individual is king of all in a day-to-day life. Hopefully this will be all achieved in an eco friendly way not JOKER's. "
6168," Profound Acting - Terrible Story
"," Joaquin Phoenix is such an amazing actor and truly displays the development of metal health issues as his life contains more and more problems. Although there is phenomenal acting, the film is let down by a terrible story line which is frankly boring.

But it's also exactly what I imagined it would be, right down to the ending. Also it's dark for a comic book movie, (not as dark as I thought it would be though) but dark enough that I'm not sure how many times I would watch it. Can I recommend this to comic book lovers? Yes, but not if they are expecting a happy movie. Easily in my top 5 this year, but I'm afraid it still can't beat Endgame for me, but those characters I've invested in for 10 years. "

I can only compare with kind of equivalent move ""Split"" where the main character had personality disorder he fulfilled all he's character so good it was amazing to watch.

"," Joker was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode in pop cultures face. So is the character Arthur played by Joaquin, an explosion made by time and pressure of/by/in the society which couldn't bother if someone was dying on the streets or starving without food. A society which will ridicule the isolated for being isolated and laugh and call him/her a clown for not achieving anything. What follows when one man stands up against the hypocrisy and injustice is anarchy and as we all know joker is a symbol of chaos. The film definitely hits the right nerve in the audience who would notice the relevance of the themes and concerns put forth to our current period and it may affect the wrong person..but the film doesn't end with the creation of joker but the birth of Batman. Chaos is not left to be celebrated but to remind us why we need order. The film is poetic in every sense though it falls slightly under to call itself a masterpiece.
Joaquin Phoenix is a Master of his craft and a spectacular sight to see. On par with Ledger. "

6186," Dishonours its predecessors
"," The Joker movie makes a distinct departure from the standard formula for super hero movies. It spends two hours developing a character and barely gets into a battle. In fact, if you showed it to somebody with no knowledge of the super hero genre, they wouldn't recognise it as a super hero movie at all. For those of us who loved the Batman relaunch by Christopher Nolan, this results in glaring inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Firstly, the death of Bruce's parents is reversioned yet again - why? Just stick with the original. Secondly, the timing is all wrong. The joker is an old man and Bruce is a kid - why? DC is risking what we've been experiencing with Spiderman, a whole bunch of incoherent timelines, when really there was no need at all. It's absolutely not beyond the capabilities of the scriptwriters to build seamlessly on top of Nolan's work. In fact, it's a discredit to their abilities if they're not able to do it.<br/><br/>Lastly, all the fears about this film being a potential trigger for violence are grounded and valid. In my group, we had a troubled teenager watching with us, and she walked out with emboldened sense of affinity with the Joker. With America's growth of sporadic shootings, it's very valid to look at movies like the Joker and blame them for feeding a mindset that a difficult life can give you an escape through grievous evil. Phoenix really needs to answer the valid questions posed to him. "
6187," Good acting but I missed Batman
"," I'm not a Superhero movie fan but I love Batman. That being said, I was expecting to see a Batman movie type, which is not. Is a good drama, not excellent, a little too long.

It's a new take on Joker, not the two previous archetypes that is a conniving genius nor the comedic goofball that both love the comedy and joy chaos and misery bring him. This Joker is just a man with behavioral and mental problems that gets unleashed and forcibly accepts his role as the clown prince of crime.<br/><br/>Overall, a fine film, that needed more. "

"," There's no doubt the design, photography and direction are superb, and the beginning and end of the film are great, but seriously, there's an entire hour in the middle of this film where very little happens. I have three main problems with The Joker: 1) whilst Phoenix is very good it feels to me like he reaches ¬¥full joker' way too early, leaving him nowhere to go and hence, his character arc is quite flat, 2) the Joker's mother is integral to his descent into mania yet she's given no meaningful screen time, with perhaps a dozen lines in the entire film. It would have been a much better film if their relationship was more fully explored. And 3) We know The Joker ends up being an arch nemesis of Batman as it's alluded to in the film, yet here he's portrayed as a bit of simpleton loser who it would be hard to believe could go on to be a master criminal. To me it didn't feel right.
Those three things plus an imaginary relationship, which in essence ended up being an, ""... and then I woke up"" device that was more annoying than clever, made The Joker not the great cinema experience it could have been. A pity really. "

6200," A very dark take on an iconic character
"," At the premiere I have had the privileged to attend last night there was not a single seat left available. Every seat in the theatre was taken and with good reason. The hype and anticipation of Phoenix as the Joker is reason itself for a mass viewing at the premiere, but there is a very very important thing to keep in mind - differentiate his masterpiece life role portrayal of the character from the movie itself (which is incredibly difficult).<br/><br/>1) The story. There actually is none. This is not a story driven movie so the entire movie hinges on the performance of the actors and the development of its characters. This year we have been treated with fantastic story driven movies (e.g. Endgame) with a complex narrative and satisfying development, as well as spectacular character driven movies (e.g. Once upon a time... in Hollywood) where the movie was held together and carried out solely on the backs of its characters and magnificent actors. Joker leans heavily on the latter completely eliminating any resemblance of a coherent and fluent story (which is not a bad thing if you have characters carrying the movie).<br/><br/>Joker unfortunately played all of its cards on Phoenix and no one else, leaving the entire movie feeling extremely empty and missing an important counterpart to the iconic role (in any shape or form). The very reason Joker functions in the DC universe is because of his relation to Batman and the balance between the crazy and the lawful (and vice versa). Eliminating any positive counterpart to Joker as a character actually gave the audience a sense of what it would be like to have the Joker without Batman.<br/><br/>As a result, what we are presented with is an insight into the Joker's psyche and it is dreadfully depressing, dark and sickening (literally). There is not a single silver lining or positive element present in this movie. The amount of negativity thrown on to the Joker (as the character) rivals the amount of negative energy this movie attacked the audience with. It was, however, the movie's sole intention to be like that but as a result, it will not be everyone's cup of tea. Unfortunately, the movie has not balanced the crazy, the lawful and the hopeful (as a good DC movie should [e.g. see C. Nolan's Dark Knight]) leaving only the crazy and depressed. It is, however, spectacular to witness the external portrayal of anarchy hitting Gotham parallel to the mental breakdown of the Joker. That comparison, as well as the almost dark messianic final scene, is one of the true highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>2) The Joker. The way Phoenix portrayed the character is simply put phenomenal. His portrayal could easily rival the magnitude of Ledger's but, it is important to note that this is not a comic book portrayal (unlike Ledger's). This was a raw and realistic portrayal of a psychopath that simply snapped and committed atrocities. His downfall can be beautifully traced from the introductory scenes to the spectacular finale and the differences were so minimal in some segments that they were difficult to spot (but were there). All up to his specific laugh that differs from those heard so far because it is difficult to listen to. The Joker always had a specific laugh, but this time we are treated with a laugh that disturbs the very core of the viewer. It is an unnatural, ill and psychotic laugh that will not easily be forgotten. It is also very difficult to watch him execute most of his plans as he is mentally breaking down at every single one of them, and the crying is especially difficult to observe because of what we saw prior to that. His portrayal is filled with sadness unlike the prior renditions.<br/><br/>It is noticeable that the character was treated with much respect in portrayal and direction, but such a powerful performance needed some relief. The movie offers none and that is its main flaw. He was unparalleled by other characters (who had great potential). Beetz had a spectacular character that could have done wonders to the story but was left gruesomely unfinished and disrespectfully left out. The detectives (Whigham and Camp) could have given the movie a completely new dimension of neo-noir that was simply put a missed opportunity. They had all of the needed characteristics that could rival the lawful to Joker's crazy, but were left as side characters on the very margin of the movie. Conroy was bland and forgetful, unimaginative and completely undeveloped. The reveal that presents the final punch for Joker is, after about an hour and a half of psychological beating, simply put - bland (and I am still not quite aware if that was the point). Finally, De Niro's beautiful performance gave a spectacular homage to his own portrayal in King of comedy. The only problem with his performance was the end of the movie where he had to defend societies standards and principles against the Joker. It was a right move to give this role to De Niro as he is an actor that can really pull this off, but in this segment he failed, not only against the Joker, but in delivering a sociological defence to the psychological attack of the Joker. This scene, this final pivotal scene should have rivalled Batman's: ""Not everyone snaps because of one bad day...."" from the iconic Killing joke. Unfortunately, De Niro's execution simply didn't have the kick it should have. Was it intentional? Maybe. If so, a bad, very bad decision.<br/><br/>3) The music. Dark and sad. Beautifully follows Jokers downfall and portrays his inner struggle in such a satisfactory way that the theme stays with the viewer long after the movie ends. The music's power is especially noticeable in the ""bathroom dancing"" scene.<br/><br/>4) The Joker legacy. This one is purely subjective. One either follows or doesn't follow the preset story. The Killing Joke comic book was iconic exactly because it was raw and dark, so following it more faithfully should have been the taken direction. Unfortunately, the director and screenwriters decided to toy with certain segments when they wanted to, and eliminate pivotal segments without much explanation as to why they did that. So, one either follows (as loosely as they want) the story or doesn't, but this kind of blend will not really sit well with most DC fans.<br/><br/>The Joker is a good movie but nothing more. It is miles away from the perfection that was Nolan's Dark Knight (and any comparison must end immediately). It has screenwriting and plot holes, it has underdeveloped and unused characters, no counterpart to the Joker or any positive and/or light segments. But it will go down remembered as Phoenix's triumphant performance followed by a spectacular soundtrack that both must be awarded with the highest of prizes.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very difficult movie to watch and enjoy, But it is a triumph in acting. The movie invoked fear and anxiety and hit all the right places in order to do so. However, that does not make it a spectacular or grand movie. It just makes it difficult, at time even too difficult to view. So, proceed with caution while entering the cinema as you will probably not be amused but disturbed for the most part. Congratulations to Phoenix on that. "
6201," Interesting, if you survive the first hour
"," Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as always. The depth of character he develops is astounding. Although his performance is flawless, I find the movie kind of lacking... The situations leading to him becoming the Joker(I hope that's not a spoiler for you, the movie is an origin story) are absurd to say the least. Things that probably wouldn't happen in real life. Probably intended as a slow build-up, the first hour of the movie is exhaustingly slow, which kind of relieves all the tension it's supposed to create... There are a couple of really good ideas in it(still talking about that first hour of the movie), which don't really make up for the not so good ones. The movie takes a turn to the interesting side after that, and it is interesting. Also, let me say, that this is Robert de Niro's first non-swearing, non-aggresive role in a while, which is really refreshing. "
6202," Did not meet expectations

6204," Strange

6205," Great performance by Joaquin but pretty dull story and less entertainment
", Only few people who love slow movies would appreciate it 
6206," Incredible performance yet nothing flawless
"," Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, definitely oscar worthy. The movie felt similar to other movies in style, but the combination makes it its own. The first trailer is enough to make you excited while the second one will take some pleasure of the experience. The arc of the joker was greatly and smoothly built till the end. The director was never lazy in frames. The love story is somehow the weakest in the movie although it has some reason for audience guidance. If you are going for an action violent movie, go see deadpool. This is a character arc. The movie was not boring in any stage, but the talk of it being so violent is wrong, and the thing about it being a perfect movie is also so wrong. "
6207," Not so impressed...
"," Saw it at the premiere tonight and I must say that I was a bit disappointed with it. Joaquin Phoenix was pretty good but not memorable as Heath Ledger (maybe because Ledger has less screen time so he stole every scene he was in), maybe he'll win an Oscar but I wouldn't bet on it. The movie itself was tad boring, as it mostly focused on Arthur's mental illnesses. Don't expect much action, as it was only present at the end of the movie. Overall, not a bad movie, just expected a lot more... "
6208," One lime
"," Needed more batman. Undoubtedly well made, undoubtedly well acted. Wanted the light as well as the dark. "
6209," Goodie but hype is hype.. And heath ledger is still the defending champ!
"," Yeah it was a good movie.. Enjoyed every moment! But no need to argue, Heath Ledgers Joker was way more interesting to watch..Father Waynes murder scene was very hitting and brought batman series to a brand new level..
Worth watching a couple of times more! "
6210," Very touching but may be harmful to any communities
", No argue that leading actor is the best. But the touching film can trigger any hopeless man in a community to commit a tragedy like Joker as it has been happening worldwide nowadays. 
6211," Joker taught me it's okay to kill people
",
6212," It's not the joker
"," I think this is a great movie and it shows great character development. But this focuses less on the joker as ""the joker"" and more on just a crazy psychopath and mental disorders. As always in movies disorders are taken to the extreme and very unrealistic which is fine when it's superhero movies or unnatural movies but this didn't go for that type. There is hardly any reference to bat man what so ever. If you remove the occasional Bruce Wayne on the TV all we have is that one scene outside the cinema. Also They really made the Wayne look like bad people which I don't think was justified. If they did it in a way showing the jokers illusion then fine Wayne family truly did care about the people of Gotham in the dark knight and such. Anyway it's a great movie but I don't see why it was nessecary to name it the joker. This reminded me a lot of V for Vendetta if they put that in the Batman Gotham universe. Again the only thing I don't understand is why is this the joker it's a great standalone movie but it isn't the joker. Anyway I highly recommend this movie it's a great standalone movie but does not really connect to the franchise in a way I wish it did. "
6213," As dark, powerful, all consuming, and true, as a blackhole.

6215," Not that special
"," I thought Joaquin Phoenix was very good, but the film itself is ponderous and boring, as well as preachy. As far as entertainment goes it fails really. I've read lots of reviewers saying it was brilliant but they couldn't watch it again. I won't watch it again either because it was so slow. It's just a film about a man with mental health problems who's let down by society. They've dressed him up as a clown and set it in Gotham with Thomas Wayne as a supporting character, but this could easily have been a script that's been knocking around Hollywood for years that's been dusted off and called Joker so that it will make some money.
There's very little action and the gory violence I'd heard about was actually quite tame in my opinion. Not worthy of the hype. "
6216," Can I watch A Joker origin?
"," I never wanted this movie, I think many Batman and DC fans don't . I almost walked away from my local theatre , not wanting answers, the mystery is more fun. To me Heath ledgers joker is brilliant ......But I braved it.......No offence to Heath , but...... "
6217," We live in a society? Yes, Yes we do
", Oh my god guys Matt damon is in the joker! Playing a perfect young Gordon opposite Pheonix's Joker. A surprising end when Gordon finally catches the clown prince of crime. What a wonderful film could have used less dancing. 
6218," AlittleinVn
"," It could be a good movie if it's not cut in Vietnam
Actually about VN was cut too much makes the film become a bit boring and less attractive than me
I think the part that killed MC and Joker was hailed as 2 segments that pulled the point of the movie for me =))))) "
6219," Good Acting, terrible plot
"," Phoenix's acting is fantastic, and definitely shows his range and it should be an inspiration for many. Beyond that, the plot is really bad. An origin film should have a good balance of set up, and then actually seeing the character in their full. This movie has maybe 30 min of the joker. It's not a joker film at all. "
6220," Extremely heavy and depressing, with no real storyline.
"," 'Joker' was an absolutely mesmerising experience, there's no doubt about that. The cinematography was exceptional and allowed the viewer to perceive the gritty reality of society from joker's perspective as an outcast. On top of that, the acting on Joaquin's part really made you question whether or not the actor was genuinely taking inspiration from the character as the severely broken vigilante antagonist, as for moments at a time you completely forget that you're not watching a real life depiction of Arthur Fleck.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that pretty much encapsulates the entire film. The storyline wasn't really present in my opinion, only a frame-by-frame journey of maybe a month passing in joker's life. No sense of revenge or justice is felt on joker's part by the end of the film, only feelings of sympathy and depression. Furthermore, for the entire two hours nothing lightens the mood as only a melancholy undertone with consecutive heart wrenching scenes defines the film. "
6221," Great, almost fantastic. If it weren't for all the self-pity
"," Joker is brilliantly directed, written, acted and shot. It's the clown-world meme bred with Taxi Driver, and it works well, especially so as a standalone film (I hope they DON'T make more films in this universe). My only issues with this movie are that there are perhaps one or two too many slow dance scenes that may decrease it's re-watchability (not to mention the shocks, tense scenes and twists in the plot won't be as effective), and I'm not a big fan of how even after the character is fully transformed into his ""Joker"" persona, he still seems to express his sadness over how he's been treated by society, when, by this point, you'd think it would be more Joker-esque for him to view everything as a comedy and only laugh at all the absurdity in the world. He just still seemed a little too bitter and self-pitying at the end for my liking. That said, it's still one of the best comic-book movies out there, mostly because of how gritty, dark and unalike your average superhero/villain movie it is. I'd certainly like to see more films like this.<br/><br/>Ahead of seeing the movie, I read enough about it to be excited for its Taxi Driver elements, but concerned about how pretentious it could be. My concerns turned out to be mostly unfounded. Despite some minor character-related issues.

"," I don't understand all the hype about this movie, is a good movie to watch nothing especial, at least in my personal opinion, Joaquin Phoenix is great actor and he nailed as the joker, but nothing to compare to Jack and Ledger those were amazing, so that being said this Joker shows to me that without Batman is nothing but crazy guy on the loose that only kills 6 people on the entire movie I don't get why people said is dark, there is not back story of why the Joker is all crazy and Psychopath, I understand why it might win the Oscars it was a movie made to win, but it lacks a story.<br/><br/>

", There is no way to batman and joker became step bros &gt;:( 
6233," Makes Heath Ledger's performance look like he took a dump on a plate.
"," Going off the obvious assumption that Nicholson's performance is the best, the JOKER film essentially is to decide who is second best, Ledger or Phoenix. Ledger's performance, while flawed and uneven, still is interesting to look at... but Phoenix takes it to the next level. Don't get me wrong, i'm still going to go see the JOKER next week and confirm my findings, as i feel first-hand viewing is necessary to any unbiased critic, and I respect that. "
6234," Wooow
", Just watch it. Disclaimer this movie is not for everybody. 
6235," Controversial, yet Fascinating
"," I think the movie goes to a certain point to humanize Arthur so that you manage to understand his frustration and struggles and slowly, by the end, tries to make you realize his mental conditions are what's driving him to murder, and like that the movie gets you to realize he's not a person to relate to. At the end it shows his ""true"" colors, considering he had been off his meds, and studies show that meds used for mental illnesses and conditions tend to completely numb the individual.
At least that's what I believe the movie is trying to convey. I felt uneasy and panicked the entirety of the screening, and that's exactly what it was trying to do. I believe this movie touched its goal to become and extremely controversial movie, you either love it (not the subject itself, of course) or hate it, no in between. "
6236," Writer's point of view: What have gone wrong and how it could have been fixed?
"," I will try my best not to make this review long, I will sum my opinion in two points.<br/><br/>I watched Joker with two mindsets, I am a Fan and I am a WRITER. The fan inside me is pleased but the writer asked for something, and would not settle with ""it was OK""<br/><br/>1- The quick escalation of events:
I understood the movie and its message very well. I congratulate the writers of this movie for making such a unique take on the joker, and I liked the sequence of the events until the final act of the film. There is a ""missing chain of events""
As a writer you need to ask yourself the following questions:
<ul><li>Why all the people in the sub-way were wearing clowns masks all of a sudden?</li><li>Why there were riots against policemen? Is it something logical you would do as a law abiding citizen that you hear about a crime on TV, and then instead of sympathizing with the victim you would hold demonstrations along with other persons you do not know and wear the exact same mask and take the same sub-way train and head towards the same destination !!!!!!!!!. Who would even sell that mask and where can someone get it at that time (70s)?</li></ul>What you need is a driving action/ a motive / a call for action/ a missing sparkle. Right ?
Here's a suggestion:
What if after Arthur had killed the three rich-boys, two policemen assaulted a random guy who dresses as a clown, (like if it is his night job or something), and we were seen scenes where it is prohibited to wear a clown mask or dress like a clown and we were shown a number of arrests in the background of a random scene where Arthur walks by and a policeman arrested a clown.
and all of a sudden the above mentioned random innocent guy who were assaulted by the police died as a result of that assault and the word has spread across all media news papers and TV and it turns out that the guy has nothing to do with the murder of the three rich-boys and as a sequence of that event People demonstrated wearing clowns, and there are clashes here and there between the security forces and the angry mob until Arthur appearance on TV as Murray thought that would be a Hit, to show a person (who works as clown) who he personally mocked and now reconciles with him and then BANG until the End of the movie and you know the rest.<br/><br/>2- The not-good overly used good elements:
The Dance was overly used. I believe if you are going to use Dancing as measurement of how a person is in control or to symbolize the state of mind of a person and how he has become the Joker of the film and it is a dance of glory and confidence, then it should have a purpose, they could have used it as if his job depends on him to perform dancing routines for children but he could not because he cannot dance, and he struggles throughout his career as a clown to be getting paid less or being ignored by his employer for that reason and now we get to understand why his fellow clowns take more advantages than him and why his boss wanted to fire him and of course not because of a stupid sign, imagine if you get mobbed and beaten in the street and then someone blames you for losing a stupid sign. This is not logical. "
6237," Nietzche's Zarathustra and Joker
"," -1-
""No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.
Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary's doom?
Yea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?""<br/><br/>Friedrich Nietzsche<br/><br/>-2-
All of Joker's ascending scenes showed Arthur with tire and weakness. In the other hand all of descending scenes were cheerful and accompanied with dancing and joy. And that is the philosophical soul due to Nietzche, ""I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his divine service. Revising the dancing scenes and relating it with Nietzche's free spirit, philosopher, Ubermensch and even the pious, it all sums up to let me see Joke "
6238," Bravo
"," This film is on the money from start to finish. Small details about films can simply ruin a movie for me. Small details and continuity in this film are almost perfect.
Ex: the first scene where he is talking to his therapist smoking a cigarette. He takes a few puffs and it pans away to the therapist and when he comes back into frame, the cigarette has burned JUST enough.
Like I said before, I care about small details like this and clearly so does the director. "
6239," An Absolute Masterpiece
"," I'm speechless. This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and it's the best. Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. Yes, I think he should absolutely win an Oscar for his portrayal as the iconic character. Heath Ledger is still my favorite Joker, but Joaquin is pretty close to the level of Ledger. Todd Phillips did a phenomenal job directing, I think this is his best work to date. Robert De Niro is not given much screen time, but he takes advantage of the time he's given, and he shines. The costume design and makeup is great as well, and I think it should be nominated for a major award. The script is incredible, I'm going to be quoting a lot of the lines for days. The violence in this movie was not even that bad, compared to other films that have had this amount of controversy. I would like to take a minute and say, that films and other media do not cause violence, this is not a ""dangerous film."" The last thirty minutes of this movie are absolutely insane, I won't be able to forget them. The death scene on the Murray Franklin Show, is absolutely crazy, and I did not see it coming. Despite the fact that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is a mass murderer, I couldn't help but feel bad for his character at times. I didn't forgive him for the things he did, but at the same time, I did sympathize with him. I really liked the progression of Arthur's character. You see him slowly growing more and more insane as the seconds go by. The runtime was perfect it never felt boring. I loved this movie, and there's so much more I want to talk about. "
6240," The Joker, the film of the year.
"," Have you ever wondered hoe the Joker became the one and only villain of all comics? Pay no attention to the comic, the films, the anime. This movie tops them all. We have now got a movie and a performance to rival Leger's performance from the 'Dark Knight'. I kid you not, we have found the team that can deliver, the viewer rating that the Joker deserves, the actor that is capable of delivering a performance of a lifetime. I highly recommend this movie to watch beyond all others this year. "

6245," A worthy successor to Heath Ledger
"," Having been hyped by the trailers and the pre release buzz, i was very excited and went to the first show possible
I must say, Joaquin's performance stirred me greatly. In the scene where he finds the truth about himself, he emotes so beautifully that it provokes sympathy. However, it is equally horrifying to witness the end product of the transformation he goes through at the end.
Another highlight of the film is Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir's bleak score, which, to me, adds a feeling of deep sadness, like some irreparable damage has been done, and there's no going back.
However, i did feel that the other, supporting actors were kind of wasted and didn't have much material to work with.
The script can be a bit unsubtle at times too, but it certainly is refreshing to see a comic book movie deal with realistic issues and be grounded in reality like it is. "
6246," A cornerstone
"," I have watched the film when the first week it's released but I didn't bother to write a review since many people already said what it is. But I think it's the time for getting a few things off my chest.<br/><br/>Almost the entire decade hollywood produced dozens of movies aimed ""political correctness"" instead of producing high quality material. Expectations have been so lowered, I didn't even care about Oscars anymore for last couple of years although I'm an avid viewer. But finally Todd Phillips and producers made a movie about maybe the most interesting villians of popular culture and it's nice to see it received high praisals.<br/><br/>The thing is this is not a superhero movie or a blockbuster. This is just a story about a disturbed man who cannot integrate into society. All we know is the protagonist will become the Joker sometime while we're watching it. So if you can ignore the fact that this is Joker's origin story, this is merely a drama. That being said if it wouldn't be a movie about Joker, probably people wouldn't have enough patience to watch and enjoy the entire movie. My point being is Philips used Joker's popularity to create an almost independent movie and it made it possible to reach much wider audience than it would have been expected.<br/><br/>But it smashed the box office in a few weeks and everyone has keen interest in it. dark tone, violence and even ""bad guy wins"" situation didn't bother anyone.<br/><br/>So I have to congratulate anyone who was involved into the production. Joker's reaction to society might be harsh but apparently many people feel something against today's paper world. Anarchy and chaos might be looking cool to teenagers usually yet this time it's embraced by huge chunk of audience. Story has been told in a way many people can relate. This is something you cannot achieve easily and Todd Philips definitely deserves a recognition for that.<br/><br/>My score was going to be 9/10 at first but I didn't like the ending sequence (last 2-3 minutes). It was actually where hollywood drew the line I guess. At least they used a nice punchline in it.<br/><br/>By the way I see that people compare this with Dark Knight and Ledger/Phoenix's Joker versions. Like I said this is not a superhero movie so I strongly disagree with Dark Knight comparison. As for Phoenix is being better or worse joker than Ledger is out of question as well because the entire movie is about Pheonix is ""becoming"" joker, not being Joker. "
6247," The hype was totally worth it
"," The joker isn't a masterpiece but I firmly loved the movie to pieces it was fun and horrifying the plot can be a bit predictable but it always finds ways to keep you intrigued like in the final act it goes from talk show, to the confession of killing some guys, to murder, and finally for a full on revolution. The Acting was great from the leads maybe Robert de Nero's acting could have been improved but still with all its many flaws I loved this movie. "
6248," A kind turns to be a monster
"," This movie highlights on how a society can turn a person with special needs to a monster. It is deep in the message. Never underestimate kind and weak people and treat them back badly. They can be something else if exploded. ""Be the change you want to see in the World"" "

"," It felt more like a movie about mental illness than something connected to a superhero universe. This doesn't make it bad, just unexpected.
The main thing that bothered me was his age. The Joker will be retired before Bruce become Batman. Also felt like he was a little too stuiped to be able to do the stuff the Joker does.
But if you take the thought away from anything you knew about the Joker before watching the movie it was perfection. Joaquin really made you feel pity for the Joker and really made you feel the ups and downs of his character. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this I would be suprised. "
6256," Phoenix Is In Full-Form
"," Joaquin Phoenix returns to Oscar conversations with his latest portrayal of comic-book character, the Joker. Previously acted on by icons like Jack Nicholson and the late Oscar winner, Heath Ledger as well as the most unforgettable Jared Leto performance, Phoenix follows a long list and looked to set himself apart. And I can truly say, that he does just that.<br/><br/>With the phenomenal performance by the lead actor that takes the audience through a story of crime, corruption, and societal issues, it's Phoenix's acting that steals the show.<br/><br/>Creating an entirely new Joker that makes you almost forget you watching a comic book movie which can also be attributed to the liking of director Todd Philips. Like mentioned before, it's Phoenix's acting that puts the film on a different level and makes his portrayal stand as the beat to date, Philips does a wonderful job at putting together a tight story that's entertaining yet thrilling. The series that lead to this poor delusional man becoming the leader of an uprising and psychotic killer make for a fantastic ride.<br/><br/>Although there are some pretty obvious badges of influences from old Scorsese films (Taxi Driver , King of Comedy) the cinematography and setting that this older Gotham is put in is soul-crushing. As the citizens are repeatedly destroyed spiritually and mentally by the upper-class. It's the details like this that just add onto a spectacular film and create for one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>I think the immediate connection when talking of Phoenix's new role, is Ledger's 'Dark Knight' Joker. When considering the how well that was performed, I believe that this latest performance sets itself up as the best but rather because of such a great character development and story building around him. No other movie has done something like this before or to its success.<br/><br/>With a stellar performance and memorable supporting characters, Joker is a top tier film for this year and deserves to be considered when calling for best picture. "
6257," Radically different from contemporary comic-book cinema structurally
"," Radically different from contemporary comic-book cinema structurally, tonally and morally, Joker has more in common with Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy than it does with Avengers Assemble or The Dark Knight. On multiple levels, it's the most challenging, subversive and nihilistic comic-book movie ever made. Needless to say, pint-sized Bat-fans should steer clear. We're first introduced to Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) applying make-up in preparation for his day job as a clown-for-hire, his face contorted into a horrific half-smile, half-cry grimace - the result of a neurological condition that causes involuntary, pathological laughter. Arthur's therapist is providing little relief, and that's before the practice is shuttered. Living in a shabby apartment block with his infirm mum, and getting nowhere as a stand-up comedian, Arthur is habitually treated with contempt or outright hostility. But his life only truly starts to spiral after a violent encounter on a subway car kickstarts a terrifying transformation.
Mirroring Arthur's descent is Gotham's own decay. It's 1981. Rubbish is piling up, 'super rats' are having their fill and Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is running for mayor. Far from the altruistic entrepreneur of Bat-dads past, Cullen's Wayne is a loathsome one-per-center who unapologetically declares Gotham's citizens 'clowns' on TV. At a time when the obscene economic divide between rich and poor grows greater by the second, Joker has its finger on the political and social pulse in daring ways. Simply put, Gotham is a powder keg and the Joker is perfectly placed to light the fuse. It should come as little surprise that Phoenix is staggeringly good here. That he's found a fresh take on a character as well worn as the Joker is one thing - that it feels just as definitive as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger's indelible interpretations is another altogether. Physically and psychologically, it's a horrifyingly funny performance. Losing 52lb for the part, Phoenix twists his skeletal frame into unsettling configurations, while he runs in a broadly comic way that looks like he has oversized shoes stuck to his soles at all times. Rather than the gleefully sadistic criminal mastermind of the comics - this is an origin story, after all - Arthur's defining characteristic is that he's ill. Phoenix engenders such powerful empathy for Fleck that some of the horrifying setbacks he faces, including a mental-health care system that profoundly fails him, are genuinely upsetting. By the film's charged, devilishly brilliant final act, you feel Fleck's rage at the injustice of a bankrupt world so overwhelmingly that, while his actions can't be justified, they can be clearly understood.
That Joker was directed and co-written by Todd Phillips - best known for the Hangover trilogy - makes this all the more remarkable. Unexpectedly, Phillips and the Ace of Knaves have turned out to be the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material; practically every choice is on the money. The early '80s aesthetic is so convincing it almost feels like a film made by a Scorsese contemporary. And the precision deployment of numerous rug-pulling revelations only works because Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver are storytellers willing to kill DC's golden geese. If there's a shortcoming, it's that Joker exists squarely in Scorsese's shadow, but it gets away with brazen thievery by openly acknowledging this. In a knowing inversion of his role in The King Of Comedy, Robert De Niro plays a beloved late-night host on whose talk show Arthur dreams of appearing. Several supporting roles are also a little thin - Zazie Beetz as a neighbour who takes a shine to Arthur being the clearest example. But this is the Joker show from first final act, you feel Fleck's rage at the injustice of a bankrupt world so overwhelmingly that, while his actions can't be justified, they can be clearly understood. LONE STRANGER That Joker was directed and co-written by Todd Phillips - best known for the Hangover trilogy - makes this all the more remarkable. Unexpectedly, Phillips and the Ace of Knaves have turned out to be the perfect marriage of filmmaker and material; practically to last frame, and Phoenix brings the house down. Sure, he's not performing magic tricks with pencils, or bringing Gotham to its knees with laughing gas, but this Joker is every bit as valid and fascinating as the ones before him, and works better for not being chained to a larger universe. If the result of the DCEU's failure to hit on a successful, consistent tone in its films is radical standalones of this quality, it may be the once-struggling studio's smartest move. "
6258," This is Cinema
"," I might as well be the 9 millionth person to express their opinions on the Joker movie online, but I won't bring any sort of strong thoughts one way or another. I really liked the film, and even if the film doesn't have an intricate plot to dissect, there's certainly plenty to discuss. I've seen a ton of Joaquin Phoenix movies, and I'm not sure he's ever been better. Todd Phillips brings the best out of Phoenix and seems to have a blast playing in an entirely different sandbox than something like The Hangover or Due Date, instead something like Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. Composer Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir does a phenomenal job setting the aesthetic and tone with her unsettling score. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher brings something entirely new to the superhero genre. This controversial, provocative, and disturbingly violent film will more than likely be debated for decades to come. Perhaps more than anything else, this is cinema. (I'm looking at you Scorsese &amp; Coppola)<br/><br/>8.0/10 "
6259," My bird loved it even more than me, but she is mental
"," The depiction of early 1980's urban squalor is really well done and helps the story of neglect and unpleasantness come to the fore. Locations, lighting and colour palette all enhance the storytelling, along with the many close ups of the protagonist to create an intense and dizzying cinema experience.<br/><br/>The story builds to what is not surprising but still a shocking climax and made me think of urban legends of that time; most notably a man who shot himself live on television. That and the broke culture of the 1970s/ 80s with rubbish piling up in the streets, the dead being stored in cattle sheds because gravediggers were on strike, people having to live intermittently by candlelight because electricity was being rationed and the involuntary three day working week, all, if not literally but evocatively find their way into this film as the cranks that make the pressure more plausible. "
6260," Joaquer
"," Joaquin nailed the role, he's awesome in this. You can totally feel the Joker's spirit rising to become the man we all know from the comics. Very good acting. Gotham city is very well made.<br/><br/>As for the negatives it is a bit slow paced and his laugh may annoy some after a while. "
6261," Oscar Worthy!
"," Amazing film, great story.
Juakine Phoenix should have Oscar for this role.
Couldn't take my eye from the screen "
6262," Joker Movie - A Best Film
"," I went to the Joker movie last night
Feelings when watching this movie, quite brainstorming but worth watching for psychological evolution, acting ability of the Joker character.
The man is too lonely and repressed from many corners of life.
A boy who grew up without a father, lacking in affection, lacking in material things. The social dimension of rich and poor division is too big. Collaborative relationships were pinched, in society, bullied by young boys, losing their jobs, ... boarding a bus to tease a child who was also cursed by his mother. From the smallest fun also. Even the last thing The weekly psychiatrist talked to had his pension cut off. Nothing but home to talk to the old mother. But my mother always reminded me to open a mailbox for 30 years. Every day gnawing on the pain piling up the pain.
In addition, he was humiliated by the program leader over the pain of his illness, being mocked in public. That much is enough to push people to the end.
The movie talks about cause and effect, whoever sows what causes karma!
A modern society without human-to-human communication like Japan and the United States will push people to tragedy in the loneliness of gnawing every second, every minute, and then what will come will smoldering fire. The fire is scary! "
6263," Flawless
"," Phoenix is impeccable and a credit to his craft. By hook or by crook you have to see this version of Joker, I found myself rooting for the guy and then ....... "
6264," One of the best DC and villain backstory movie ever!
"," When I watched the Joker movie at my local cinema, I prepared myself for the unexpected. After scene after scene, when the movie finished and went home. BOI I FELT SO ALIVE! The adrenaline feeling I got from the movie was no adrenaline feeling from a movie I've ever gotten! The movie was exciting, shocking, mind-twisting and 100% FANTASTIC! Joaquin Phoenix DESTROYED the roll man, he's a great Joker actor. The last time we have gotten a good Joker actor was Heath Ledger from 2012 The Dark Knight. I can see how the ghost of Heath in the Joker costume is proudly saying to Phoenix behind him: ""You did amazing. Got get em, brother."" Get it since they both played the Joker? Anyways, a must-watch experience! "
6265," DC in right track
"," This film is a best origin for joker and joaquin phoneix is surely getting oscar.The movie is bind with good acting,story and humour also dancing üòÇüòÇüòÇjust kidding. This movie is must watch for everyone even you are marvel fan because iam a marvel fan too .This movie is perfect but iam demarking a mark because of we need joker and batman together again on a big screen "
6266," Knock knock...
"," Who's there? Well, it's Arthur Fleck not Joker. Was this a good film? Yes, it's very good. I just felt a bit disappointed that there (for me) wasn't enough Joker. He doesn't really appear until the last 20 minutes which is a shame because the film goes into overdrive and really has you wondering what is about to happen. There are some really good touches, a few unexpected scenes and a good but subtle twist which many will miss completely it's that small. Phoenix is as good as everyone says, De Niro is just adding star name to a film that doesn't need it. It's begging for a sequel where the joker is on the loose creating havoc but alas I doubt we'll see one from the people involved here. "
6267," Absolutely fantastic
"," Thought it was fantastic. I won't go all out, seems enough people have made it clear about the critics. Let's put the critics &amp; mirroring society aside. Phoenixes performance is superb. You can't help but think of Heath of course. An Amazing image of a crazy joker obsessed with anarchy. &amp; just like Ledger, Phoenix always puts everything into becoming his roles/characters. That is very obvious. It also gives the viewer this sense of satisfaction from many angles of the Batman canon without making the film seem like it will take it too far Into the story arch of the cape crusader. Remember, this takes place damn near 20+ years before Batman is even around. You get a few treats making it clear that the writer is aware of the Main story arch, As well as Easter eggs, but this is Jokers limelight. It still feels like a stand alone Joker film that does NOT Need a sequel. In fact that would probably ruin the hype. There are a few slip ups as far as props and one too many bullets being shot. Nothing serious unless about that stuff. One thing I will say is that..if you're a non stop action fan then do not go see the film. It's super entertaining, not boring whatsoever. Although if you go in expecting Heath ledgers Joker, or evening big similarities, then you will be bored &amp; disappointed. This is Jokers story With plenty to offer &amp; Nice little Easter eggs. Go see!! "
6268," Joaquin Phoenix sure to get Best Actor Oscar nomination for this
",
6269," A movie that has the patience & coincidence to deliver a story.
"," The world of Hollywood seems to just churn out cliche'd, shallow, unoriginal garbage with an overdose of special effects.<br/><br/>is so refreshing to find a film that takes the time to build a storey, character and not loose it's way to the very end. well done to all involved for creating an engaging, well acted, directed and edited film.<br/><br/>I hope the success of this film is a lesson to the film makers that a good storyline and acting, and not following the crowd is the way forward. "
6270," Last 30 minutes were incredible
"," First 90 minutes were a waste of time, last 30 minutes were incredible "
6271," The backround music kind of ruined it for me
", It's a very captivating movie with a nice performance by Phoenix but the music was overdramatic and went on and on for more than necessary. The soundtrack was kind of a big thing for a movie like this so I feel like it wasn't as good as I would have expected. 
6272," Very well done.
"," This was better than I even expected, and I expected it to be very good. A must see even if you are not a fan of comic book movies. It's great cinema. "

6275," Beautiful
"," One of the best joker performances since jack Nicholson, so wonderfully portrayed. "
6276," Amazing
"," Edgy, dynamic and on point. Cinema to re-enjoy and over. "
6277," Good storyline
"," The storyline is very nice! The beginning of the movie was kinda long, and the sad cello after every moment was kinda dramatic. But the storyline was good "
6278," Ending should be where Joker smears his blood stained lips
", Direction is great. Background scores adds the soul to it. Acting is no doubt about it. But the ending should have been done when joker rises when he smears his face with blood. 
6279," Over hyped??? No way!
"," I kept a lot of patience before finally deciding to watch the movie after 3 weeks. Since there was so much hype about the movie i waited for my friends feedback who were head and heels over the acting of Joaquin. I regret being a fool and waiting for the reviews rather than using my instincts. Boy was i wrong. This movie is so beautifully crafted. It's perfectly dark and though the storyline is slow, it was justified since It had to show Jokers development as a character. Joaquin certainly deserves an oscar for his acting. What a legendary performance! Dont miss this one pls! "
6280," THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT
", I think this movie was great because this movie is about a guy with a mental illness like many people in our world has and this show us that we need to take care or to like see them and don't be mean to them 
6281," Near perfect character arc
"," Enough has been written about the movie being worth all the hype. So I'll not go much into it. This is a truly remarkable cinematic work. What stood out most sharply for me was how Todd Phillips painted the picture of Joker - it wasn't at all simplistic, but the complexity is never too labouring for the audience. And his genius actor, Joaquin Phoenix rises above possibly all his expectations to complete a near perfect show! Whether Academy gives the Best Actor to him or not, he's already a winner in all of our hearts. He was phenomenal, I could sense everyone in the audience could feel his pain. And not to mention the costume, set design, camera work and brilliant score. Violence in the movie is absolutely necessary and very tastefully done. Last but not the least, the story is set in the 60s or 70s Gotham City but its message &amp; violence are well adapted to today's hate-filled world. Without a doubt, the best movie this year! 9/10. "
6282," Best movie of 2019
"," It's magical in so many ways. The acting is tremendous and deserves an oscar. So layered between being unaware of being in a psychocitc episode, to a conscious choice to controlably give in to his insanity and aggression and hate. But then, there are also moments where he has absolutely no clue how incredibly insane, dangerous he comes across. Not being psycotic, but just really scary. His childlike incapability to communicate or make contact in a 'appropriate' way, especially to women and kids, is heartbreaking and scarily unsettling.<br/><br/>Half way trough the movie it's no longer clear whether stuff is actually happening or happening in his head. Till the end you don't know what actually happend. There are so many loose ends/interpretations that you can fantasize and discuss about for hours. And th√°t is what makes a movie a great one in my opinion.<br/><br/>Who did he actually kill? What actually happened out there in the real world? Seems that he killed the guys in the subway.. But after that? What was real and which things happened in his head after he stopped taking his meds?
In his psychotic fantasies he does brave heroic things (in his own delusional way).. There were some scenes that made everything look too easy, too unrealistic for the person he actually is.. I reminded of when he all of a sudden became brave and ended up with a girlfriend, which turned out to be... Yup - - &gt;a psychotic fantasy..<br/><br/>Therefore the question rises. How, why and when did he end up in the mental hospital? Did you notice he was not as skinny? so he must have been there a while. So did we just skip time and are we shown an image of a man who will always be a danger to society.. Or....
Or did he create an heroic image of himself, killing a TV host, being a hero to the poor, which was actually a psychotic episode? Maybe even while already being in the hospital? I love the fact that you just don't know. I hope they never make a sequel to awnser those questions. This open end is just perfect. "
6283," Masterpiece
"," A brilliant story that makes Joker a human character. Extremely Mad, But Human ... A Magnificent Interpretation of Joaquin Phoenix, that Deserves the Oscar for the Best Actor "
6284," Masked clown is Phoenix
", Wow! Joaquin Phoenix done his best and given a wonderful performance in this movie for the clown prince of crime. 
6285," Joaquin is brilliant & totally embodies the character
",
6286," Joker character that's hard to understand
"," As if made to understand, but the Joker is still the Joker. No matter how deep we try to understand, it is very difficult to understand. The Joker tries to get us to stand in his perception. Do not be surprised if in a few moments, you want to defend everything he does. But also don't be surprised if after realizing all that, you feel that you have been tricked by Arthur's thoughts.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips cleverly takes us round and round to see the Joker from various sides, without us knowing. Combined with the skill of acting three times the nominee Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix plays a mimic, do not expect by watching the Joker you will be able to understand the contents of his head. "
6287," Best performance of 2019, Jaoquin Pheonix delivers an incredible performance
"," The film is unique and interesting in so many different ways, It tells the story of a man who hasn't achieved anything in his life and is dealing with some incredibly horrible mental health and emotional issues, trying to escape his sorrow and achieve true happiness by making a statement about his life and showing the world his sense of humor and trying to make comedy about his life. It's an incredible performance from Jaoquin Pheonix portraying a man trying to find the comedy in the circumstances he lives in. Incredible acting, worldbuilding, cinematography and directing. Must see movie "
6288," ""Joker 2019"" is definitely the best American movie of the year, Jaoquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar award for this
"," ""Joker"" (2019) is an origin story for the super-villain character. After Heath Ledger's outstanding, haunting performance as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"", even I thought that it will be impossible for any actor to reach the highest of standards as the villainous Joker. Heath Ledger had set the level too high to reach, but the great, talented Jaoquin Phoenix has flown high and reached that exact highest of standard ; he definitely deserves all the awards for this performance in ""Joker"", and so does the director of this movie. "
6289," Damn! We See Bruce Wayne's Parents Blown Away Again...
"," An excellent interpretation of the Joker! An all new take on a on one of the most iconic characters in comic book history. The Joker's alter ego just wanted a normal carefree life as a stand up comic. This Joker is seriously ill emotionally, among other issues! Great film!! Okay peace out!! "
6290," Good movie to watch : )
", The events flowed naturally and it was an overall good movie to watch. Very nice acting as well. 
6291," A must watch masterpiece
"," With Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing actions, Joker delicately treads a fine line between what need to be explicitly told and what audiences must interpret themselves. It's not an exaggeration to say this has best character development I've seen in a movie. Would undoubly recommend it to anyone. It's a contender for the movie of the decade, if there's such thing. "
6292," Every Psychology Major's Favorite
"," This movie was phenomenal. I walked in as a Psych major knowing that it would be very intense and very dark. A lot of reviews say it's ""too disturbing"". I find these comments are most likely from people who do not understand mental health disorders. I think they are possibly the viewers that this movie is trying to reach out to. The premise teaches the audience what it is like to be someone with a mental disorder in today's society. The mistreatment, abuse (verbal and physical) and overall lack of sympathy. It also focuses on the mental health system, counselors and pharmaceuticals alike that show what happens when someone can no longer receive the help they need. This is exactly what happens, and Arthur begins to spiral, and yet, he thinks he is okay. This movie had me wrapped in it the entire two hours and had me focused on mental health awareness AND had me fangirling. Worth the watch. Maybe bring a friend, though! "
6293," Great Movie
", Excellent movie very well defines how Joker exists in Gotham city and the conditions how turned him to be Joker 
6294," The end result justifies the slow start - A masterpiece
"," If you were expecting this to be an action movie or a superhero movie... well you are wrong.... this movie is all about Joaquin Phoenix becoming the Joker, the making of the Joker., some scenes are so wonderfully shot..all you gotta do is sit back and enjoy. This actor though, so much talent there! Wow absoltely loved it! I understand some will be disappointed, to be honest I wasnt expecting this for a Joker Movie but in the end it was truly worth it! "
6295," Perfect
", Perfect movie ! 
6296," Put on a happy face cause the clown is here
"," Written &amp; Directed by todd phillips, Joker tells the story of one of those roaming souls. With a outstanding performance by joaquin phoenix as joker. Arthur Fleck finds himself at the bottom of the barrel of Gotham's underbelly. Arthur who has gone through so much trauma in his life time , is simply a man who wants to put on a happy face . A haunted soul that would later become the king of crime himself The Joker. Joker is a insightful, almost painfully honest look into the issues society faces with addressing mental illness in an adequate fashion. Also a believable, take on the potential origins of The Joker and his descent into madness. This might be the darkest most, horrifying DC movie ever. There are some scenes where you might just close your eyes or just leave. Most of you know i generally ignore DC Movies I only watch Marvel but this movie i had to see. you should watch this movie its A jaw dropping, astonishing, mind blowing movie a movie that will certainly force you to think about such conditions.you've watched &amp; enjoyed joker in Batman: The Dark Knight and many other movies in the past But believe me you don't know this one! It's just great to see DC starting to make good films and stop trying to catch up with marvel &amp; the MCU. To a large extent Music does play a crucial role in Movies A big shout-out to Hildur Gu√∞nad√≥ttir for her amazing background score, it just gives you goosebumps. I think everyone out there especially joker fans should see this movie.. But at the end it leaves y'all with a thought a serious thought.. Thank God, Gotham is not REAL. "

6302," Under your skin
"," No, this isn't going to be a testimony as to why this film is so socially important. Is it, though? Maybe. Probably not. In the end it tells the story of a severely mentally ill man. That premise stays the same throughout the whole film. The message is obvious, but if you try not to take it too seriously, Joker is quite capable of getting under your skin. Just how he would have liked it. "
6303," True Masterpiece
"," After watching the first version of the trailer I was a little bit sceptical, then I've seen a new one and decided to give it a try. Despite a hype going all over the place, it was the best decision so far. This movie is truly something else. Those 2 hours went like nothing. However, I was expecting a longer ending to mark the beauty and madness of the story simultaneously. It's not an action movie, it's all about the story. "

The story really sticks with you. I was so surprised by this ""superhero"" movie. It's like no other. Even Robert De Niro's casting in his role is genius after his recent public interview carry ons just like the character he plays in this movie. A must see! "
6306," Very good movie
"," Good direction and acting. Solid character development. The scene of the killing in the subway is gorgeous. Probably best movie based on a superheroe ever: It actually has a plot! I hope the success of this movie changes the mind of Hollywood to invest more in quality instead of VFX.<br/><br/>However, it's good but it lacks something else to become a masterpiece so don't put your expectations too high. "
6307," Joaquin Pheonix's performance alone is perfect
", It's good to see a movie that present the perspectives of the mentally ill and poor people. And the final scene was just top notch. Heath would have been proud. 
6308," I loved this movie but i have my doubts...
"," I Have my doubts<br/><br/>Let me Explain, This movie is a perfect, well film and amazing experience. This emotional Narrative of Joker's background history is amazing, is creative, is well performed and does not have errors in any way. But I don't know if I can agree with this version of the Joker. He is a Sick, bad, emotional Clown that becomes a psychopath because of bad people in Gotham. So Now the Joker has a purpose. Emotionally speaking he only wants revenge and love. This new Joker is Not a Joke, is real, he is in pain, he is sad... For me the bad and careless, non purpose anarchist that only want to make Jokes with bombs and other stuff is more scary, more unpredictable, more clever, more shady, more Joker... You always can have a turnoff or something to justify everything but this is my perspective. This Joker was defeated by Gotham and this new Gotham is now the Joker. This Gotham can't create a Pinguin without a little bit of jokerness, or any other villain. It will need writing skills to create a batman without vengeance. This Gotham is the new villain and we will need to agree with Ra's al Ghul perspective about destroy and rebuild the City jejeje (just a joke...) OMG!, even I am becoming a joker!! Jajajaja<br/><br/>A cool thing about this movie is the symbolisms! We can see a batman face in the makeup scene, going upstairs sad and going downstairs dancing is a meaningful part when The Joker embrace his badness and craziness and is a well put psychological contradiction that makes sense! The representation of hope is a midget full of fear! Heaven was Arkham Mental Hospital with everything in Withe and crazy happiness!!!! Blood becomes the smile! Gotham Becomes a Joke! Everyone is morally wrong but they have a functional society!! And Last, Joker killing his Mother?..., or not his mother!!! What do you think!? Did you believe the documents? Or it was just a fake bad joke???? I don't know! I just don't trust Gotham!...<br/><br/>Rating 9 because of the disagreement!<br/><br/>Acting 10

"," Before starting with the review,I have to say an important thing;if you decide to go to the cinema to watch joker, prepare yourself to what something you have ever seen.
Before watching the film I had a lot of hype,especially because he won the ""leone d'oro"",I remember when I watched the trailer for the first time, I felt a unique feeling and immediately I understood that he would have been an amazing film.
This is a very particular film, because it tells the joker's story in a different way,in fact in all joker's films, this giant character has been described as a crazy killer, without feelings;while in this film we discover something more about his story and the reason why Arthur Flek became the joker.
An interesting thing to do is the comparison between the joker of Joaquin Phoenix and the joker of Heath Ledger.
I don't know who is the better one, both of them are amazing,but there are a lot of differences between them.
The first thing to say is that they play a completely different role:Heath Ledger plays the villain in a movie focused on Batman, while Phoenix plays in a film, where he is the protagonist, reason why we discover a lot of important thing about him and we are able to justify his actions and idolize what he does, even if wrong. Personally i loved and the dark knight's joker, but after watching this new chapter I can say that it's my favourite and I recommend it to everyone, RUN TO THE CINEMA!!üÉèü§° "
6314," ""Joker"" a masterpiece of awareness of rising evil
",
6315," A Joker origin story - or one man's descent into madness?
"," Brilliant narration around a superb oscar-nom worthy performance from the everembrassing Joaquin Phoenix.
Only real issue I have is when a major origin story of a beloved(?) character only takes around 10 days to complet; leaves me lacking more background.
Other than that, an utter disturbingly excellent and buzzkiller piece of American cinema. "
6316," Superb portrayal of a mentally ill man
"," I rarely see movies in theaters, usually because I find the hype is not all it is cracked up to be. The last movie I saw in theater was 'A Quiet Place,"" and the hype for it was consistent for me (won't bore you w/reasons why, different review), so ""Joker"" brought me out of my theater slump and sadly, the hype for it is misguided.<br/><br/>This is a fantastically well done and well acted movie about a severely mentally unwell man and a system that fails him, repeatedly. Phoenix absolutely deserves an Oscar for his portrayl of Arthur.<br/><br/>However, this is a terrible movie about a super villain or the origin of ""The Joker."" I did not see nor was I disturbed by any so-called ""violence."" In fact, I felt the movie sorely lacked it. Where was the homicidal rage? A cpl murders a homocidal maniac doesn't make. In fact, I felt nothing for the few victims of Arthur's. They all deserved it. I felt sympathy the entire movie for Arthur. I wanted him to off ppl b4 he did it and frankly silently cheered for him when he did. This makes me want to cheer for the Joker in any future installements of Batman movies versus cheering for Batman. It is due to this, I feel the movie failed. It failed in making me feel anything but sympathy for Arthur/Joker and it failed at making him a scary, homicidal maniac. It simply made him a broken man, whom his entire life had endured horrible abuses, snapped one day, and decided no more. 7/10 for amazing acting and the mental health portrayl it truly was. "
6317," A bold and lively film, with a bouncy rhythm that makes it appealing. It has, of course, depicted a lot of violence.

6318," Brilliant movie / awesome performance
"," This a really good one.
Joaquin makes an amazing performance!
As a stand-alone movie for everyone, I mean people who don't really have in mind the DC universe.
As far as an origin story, about one of the most iconic villains of all time, has some flaws!(very little catastrophe of what joker can cause, Thomas Wayne portrayed as an arrogant stupid)
And propably is an one off thing, no sequel or no reprise of this joker in the DC universe (DC sucks in the movies) "
6319," Truly amazing film.
"," So I would consider myself a movie lover and film has been dying a slow, methodical death over the years... Hollywood has lost its creativity. Instead we are bombarded with sequels, rehashed stories, cgi filled blockbusters... It just gets old.<br/><br/>But this. This is a true film.<br/><br/>Everything from the cinematography, to the lighting, to the score and of coarse, the acting, is superb. Phoenix gives a performance of a lifetime. If he doesn't win 3 Oscars at one time, you'll know the show is rigged.<br/><br/>One thing I took away from this film is, be kind. Treat everyone you come into contact with kindly. Even if they are rude and mean. You never know what people are going through... Be more aware of the person next to you. Your one act of kindness could, not just brighten their day, but maybe save their life. "
6320," The best movie and best performance in the last 20 years.
"," Joaquin Phoenix delivers a stunning, chilling portrayal of the Joker. He put his own spin on it and it is completely mesmerizing. This movie completely left me speechless in the same way Silence of the Lambs did the first time I watched it. Phillips should win best Director. The score should also win. The supporting performances were all good. "
6321," Excellent movie. Loved this joker film
", So good iv Seen it twice. Best acting ever. Totally Oscar-worthy 
6322," Just give Phoenix the Oscar !
", One of the best films of the decade. Joaquin Phoenix is simply amazing. No competitor for this year's oscar. 
6323," Does Joaquin deserve an oscar?
"," I've been a fan of Joaquin Phoenix for many many years and have seen him jump headfirst into many complex characters but he goes above and beyond here. This is possibly his best performance to date and yes he definitely deserves an Oscar for his work.<br/><br/>But does him deserving the Oscar make him better than Heath? If you compare Joaquin Phoenix to Heath Ledger your denying yourself the chance to see the film clearly, both of them are the best at the joker they brought to the party.<br/><br/>The fact this came from the direction of the director that brought us the hangover is amazing because it's possibly the best dive into mental health in film history.<br/><br/>Definitely go see this, for Joaquins performance alone it's well worth it. "
6324," Sadness, and heart breaking
"," Great film, addressing real problems within societies. Social unfairness, cruelty to each other , carelessness "
6325," Weird and Wonderful.

6330," Its good but not as good as they say
"," I was really hyped when about to go see this movie. I'm afraid that it might just have been that... hype. The movie was slow in the beginning but took up speed in the last act.
It was good but not as good as people said "
6331," Dark, compelling and Oscar worthy!
"," Joaquin Phoenix should win an Oscar for his take on Joker. This is dark, emotive and thrilling. "
6332," Amazing play, but I was missing something
"," Many of us, who watched the iconic Joker play of Heath Ledger were trying to compare it with play of Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. One can try to witness those ""elegant madness"" of Joker character- see craziness in his eyes, laugh, confidence, joy of killing; and I want to see it all, all at once, like in ""The Dark Knight"" movie.
Through the whole movie, I was waiting for that moment... And now, seems like he found a chance for revenge, he puts his hands on the wall, lowers his head, and BUM; that's it, ohh, that look. But... next we see a man, who is crazy, but it's the illness, it made him to be this, all those circumstances, society; so real, too real for my taste. Why not going further, why not putting that spark in his eyes? I don't want to feel sad for him, I want to feel angry, excited and not believe how he can laugh at the end.
Play was good, but all I wanted is that crazy Joker, and I am getting a real man. Is it something you want also? I don't know, and it shouldn't be. Nevertheless, you will like this movie for sure. "
6333," Masterclass
", A Phoenix Masterclass In physicality and pitch perfect manic portrayal of Arthur's gradual evolution towards a stage one Joker. It's never OTT and contains snippets up there with Ledger's Nurse albeit more subtle reflecting a Joker volume of 5 not 11. Gotham's nightmare and dismal demise is the fitting backdrop to the uprising of the desperate underclass. The film never dips from start to finish. Superb. Can't wait to see it again! 
6334," The right title and the BEST ACTING I HAVE EVER SEEN
"," The director did the right thing naming the movie ""Joker"" and not ""The Joker"". This is not a movie about the super villain of Gotham but how he became that.
Joaquin Phoenix? THE GREATEST. I won't compare HIM with Heath Ledger because it's impossible. They incarnated two different faces of the character and there is no comparison.
Undoubtedly you are not going to watch the most popular and loved badass but Joaquin Phoenix making HISTORY. "
6335," Incredible Experience
"," A dark reflection of a man's descent into the nightmare world of mental illness and it's repercussions on a society that offers him no empathy, understanding or contrition. Arthur is a desperately sad individual who is the victim of his own utterly dysfunctional upbringing, a mental condition that causes him to laugh inappropriately and his complete inability to engage with his colleagues or interact with society. Phoenix is phenomenal, an actor who must have studied and understood the illness he expertly portrays and the catastrophic results if it is left untreated.
Arthur is a clown and a failed comedian who, due to the collapse of social care has his treatment funding and his medication withdrawn. He's his mother's carer and obsessed with De Niro's TV character. That's all you need to know.
The violence is extreme, bloody but totally in context with the character and plot, however many will find one particular scene extremely disturbing. You've been warned.
A brilliant film, disturbing, harrowing and thoroughly gripping. Washington Post scored it 2/4 - ignore it and make up your own mind. "

"," Okay, I am not usually a drama person but I love joker from Batman. We all do. That's why I wanted to give this movie a shot knowing it's only drama. And I am really glad I took that decision. Every single act of Jaoqlin was incredible. He really put life to the character Joker. When I was watching the movie, I felt like I was living through him as a joker. Hands-down the best acting ever. The movie is nothing like you expect from the regular drama. Trust me, I thought it would be inspirational but...not really and I actually liked that. The movie is about how he came to be what he is and you actually tend to understand him more and more and you will love joker now. I could keep writing but I don't want to give any spoilers. This movie is a must watch for any kind of movie lovers. "

""Joker"" 2019 will stand the test of time and thus take it's rightful place among the all-time, very best cinematic pieces.. The themes/messages are those most pressing and brewing now and for some time directly from our contemporary reality itself while the few political referrence trace to eons old subject matter that will always wear well and, finally, a charcter analysis that dive's as deep into that topic that most films shy from fully scrutinizing..

"," First of all this is the begining of the joker's story, the Batman doesnt even exist in this movie, Bruce Wayne is a little kid, i think that a little kid wouldnt defeat joker so, if this is a begining, it means that joker has a lot to grow as a villain right? Lets not be dumb here and say this joker is not smart because you didnt see him in action, this is the story of how Arthur Fleck becomes the joker, not the story of how the joker destroys Gotham city
The movie is great, has a great story and it has a big impact on people who have the mind and the eyes to see this movie
Joaquin Phoenix deserves an oscar and it is legitim to say that this is a masterpiece, because it is
Stop criticising just because you feel like top critics, you're not, you wanna be original, watch the movie with an open mind, because you need a good mind to see this movie

6347," Joker
", Absolutely fabulous movie. Joaquin Phoenix proves that he is the best actor...! üëå 
6348," Masterpiece! And if you look in today's society, the rebellion he caused exists!
"," As a big fan of the Batman, Joker, the psychology of the characters (read Batman psychology, the book), and psychological thrillers, I can say that it exceeded my expectations. It's simply brilliant, a masterpiece. However something that my French boyfriend said after we saw the movie in the cinema, made me thinking. We were discussing about the movie, menthal health, societal problems, and then he said something (I was thinking about the same thing): ""when I saw the scenes with the protests of poor and working class against social injustice and the rich, wearing clown masks, that quickly turned into a rebellion, with people going out on the street, burning places, vandalising, fighting with the police, getting killed by the police, everyone having their own agenda, bit in the same time √† common one, it reminded me of the gilets jaunes in France."" And that's one of the reasons why we should take this movie seriously. "
6349," A birth of a villainous character. . . .
"," THIS FILM IS NOT A FAMILY FILM! It is the birth of a character and not portrayal. It is a character study of a evolution of a man's descent into the criminally insane. A full on exploration of why Joker's brand of villainy and why it is essential to the birth of the Dark Knight. If Phoenix wins the Oscar, history will be made, portrayal of the same character (2 times) wins.<br/><br/>Phoenix, Phillips, and the Movie Oscar worth? We shall see. "
6350," wow.
",
6351," Almost a Masterpiece
"," Joker was and is the best Anti-hero Villian of all times. Pheonix's potrayal of the Joker was mere perfect. When you feel sympathetic with a villian, you know how good of a characterisation was done. Only thing I would say negative about the movie was the support cast which was a let down. "
6352," Genius
"," Enough has been said in favour of Joaquin Phoenix's performance that I don't need to add to it. I will just say that it as least as good as Heath Ledger's. Some might call that heresy, that Ledger gave the immortal perfomance of the iconic Joker; but the same was said of Jack Nicholson, and I don't see any objective reason why Phoenix and Ledger can't be ranked side by side.
The screenplay was well-written and thought through. Horrific in a deep and meaningful way, with only the occasional shortcomings. "

6358," ""This IS not America"" aka ""King of Comedy.
"," This is part of the DC comics batman franchise. Although it clearly isn't. It is a study of Arthur Fleck a man who needs help, who need support, in an America in which the poor have nothing not even health care and the rich have, well everything. The root of Arthur's mental health problems is the abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother's boyfriend. Now 30 odd years later he gets by trying to make it as a stand up comedian paying his way as a promotional clown. Earning enough money to care for his ailing mother. She is delusional thinking that Thomas Wayne of Wayne Foundation is the father. He isn't or maybe he is.<br/><br/>Arthur's failed attempts at comedy bringing him to the attention of Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) .....I will leave the plot there (no spoilers)<br/><br/>What we get in the two hours plus is a modern study of the collapse of a caring society and the further collapse into madness of Arthur.<br/><br/>This is 21st America with the clowns running the country and the mental health of its citizens not cared for by a society who puts profits before care. ( a somewhat simplified view I know, but a true reflection)<br/><br/>In Arthur Fleck, who later calls himself Joker, played in an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Pheonixs. Arthur joins the great misguided villians who are battling their inner demons. He joins Rupert Pupkin ( De Niro in King of Comedy which the plot takes reference from throughout) Geoff Tibbs as desperate comedians to be. Although the battle with mental illness mirrors Norman Bates in his act of Matricide. For sheer evil Arthur is up there with Larry from Irvine Walsh's Acid House<br/><br/>Notable mentions have to go to the soundtrack which sets the film in a dark light. The strings throughout cut through the darkness and set Arthur's descent into madness perfectly. Frank Sinatra never sounded so jaded and apt on ""That's Life"" and a masterful ""Send in the Clowns"". Gary Glitter's ""Rock n Roll part 2""fits Arthur's ongoing fight with his demons . (Glitter isn't known in the USA for his odious crimes, like he is in the UK) Cream's White Room also seems apt when Arthur is being taken away by the police.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a masterpiece and for a major studio to produce a film so dark as to be commended. "
6359," Truely a breath of fresh air in this sorta over saturated genre of Super Hero movies
"," I never thought they could pull off a Villain solo film without it being apart of some giant cinematic universe(like Universals recents The Mummy reboot.) . But when I saw the trailer, it got me intrigued by the direction they are taking the character and what kind of film this gonna be. From the Amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix, the well done cinematography, perfect music, the writing and so much more! But this film is a incredibly dark, do not take your children to this. This film talks themes of mental illness, insanity, murder, and suicide. "

The best lead I have seen this year without doubt. "
6366," Brilliant film
",
6367," Speechless...
"," If you get the chance, go ahead and watch this in theaters because that is the way this movie is meant to be seen. A standalone film with a take on the Joker that is not superhuman or invincible, but rather, vulnerable, fragile, what every man must probably look like before becoming a villain. This gave the audience a sequence of events that seamlessly tie together this man's descent into madness. The craziest thing about the movie is that I am sure it would be just as good if it were about a regular guy and not about the joker.<br/><br/>Absolute quality across the board, cinematography, scoring, performances, overall plot was intoxicating to experience. This definitely is my favorite movie of the year... quite possibly the past few years too. Granted it was violent although it wasn't gratuitous... and some people complain that it was, but I am not sure they know what gratuitous means because the kills were psychologically tied to the character or due to provocation.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SPOILERS *********** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN<br/><br/>
The first time the joker kills its because three men are attacking him on a subway for interrupting their harassment of a lady on a subway with his laugh- attack. The second kill is of Arthur's adoptive mother, who before killing her found out that she was dating a man who abused Arthur so severely that it caused his neurological condition that prevents him from stopping random laugh attacks... he resents her extremely for the lies, and the abuse. The third kill happens much later in the film when a character named Randall tries to get Arthur to talk about the gun because cops are questioning him, Arthur is still upset over the fact that this guy cost him his job so he kills him in front a dwarf who he could've killed but doesn't because this particular person did nothing to wrong him. The last kill of the film is the absolutely the most shocking in which he knows Robert De Niro brought him on the show to use and ridicule him in front of the nation on camera for not being funny, and he exposes the truth of the world he experiences daily to the audience and then shortly shoots Robert De Niro's character... gratuitous, not at all... gratuitous is something that is unnecessary, that is not the case at all in this film. I can honestly say this movie was not I was expecting, and I am 100% okay with that. "

6375," Truly Epic!
"," This movie portrays the making of a man named Arthur Fleck into a villain, by the cruel and unjust decaying city of Gotham with crime rate and violence pacing with the time. Innocent and mentally ill, Arthur is a struggling son trying to keep up with the world, to follow his dream of becoming a stand up comedian and to aid his mother out of her illness. Life grows harsh to him with everybody trying to push him down the hill. He got beaten up at many public places by freaks out in the town for no real reason, mocked in a famous television show by the man he took for his idol. As the movie continues the viewers get to know more about the past life of Arthur. Arthur's story gets darker as he grows more vicious and dangerous. Meanwhile the tension grows in a large section of downtrodden people of the Gotham City waiting to erupt as all the events reaches to the final countdown.
This movie is a great masterpiece in itself, with absolutely stunning direction, acting and story. "
6376," Overwhelming complexity in this movie
"," This movie showed us a new perspective and development of a very complex character. For sure a very very human one, thats why the movie has a more sad meaning. I think it's important to show that difference to some people that thinks this movie wanted to glorify the madness and crimes committed by any monster; if you watch the movie with close detail, you will notice it's not about how cool mental illness are... The laugh of the character hides pain and suffering, thats a big clue for what the movie is trying to say about mental problems.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie i will watch over and over again. "

6378," Joaquin Phoenix gives a brilliant and dedicated performance
"," My first review. Not only is Todd Phillip's 'Joker' an incredible character study with Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck, but there are so many filmmaking techniques involved to make this film special. The use of certain colors to portray a dark Gotham City (which is really NYC), brilliant cinematography, clever shot structure and great direction. If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win his first Oscar for this performance, then nobody should. This is coming from someone who is not at all a fan of DC or Marvel, which should show you how very special this film really is. Nothing, in my opinion, will ever top Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight, but Joaquin Phoenix is just as great here, as he really allows the audience to witness Arthur Fleck's descent into becoming the Joker. Go watch this film and enjoy Phoenix's remarkable portrayal of one of cinema's most villainous characters. "

6384," the human condition in the urban environment ! long overdue theme and central to the Joker
"," Chillingly realistic. The speed of the suspense is in tune, along with the soundtrack, with the despair, disconnect, and the abandonment of the people. Social critiques are always good, it keeps the true north: improving the human condition, present in our commonly selfish and greedy minds. This movie succeeds at delivering several messages. Early and throughout the movie more sublime communications are pictured to touch on the human condition in the urban environment and its dynamics. The violent interaction between people and cars, constant bombardment though the radio, building equipment, illumination, the multifamily housing building, accessibility (when he bangs against the exit door at the hospital). Great value in these scenes. Climbing vs dancing down the steep stairs. Then the more popular themes like the effect of TV shows and the hunting for ratings. Class divide. Mental illness. I mean, touched on so many different social-political issues while delivering the persona and its story to the character of the Joker. Phoenix was incredible, just so awesome. The Joker's birth, moment of epiphany at the public restroom is out of this world. "
6385," Joker is a masterpiece and must watch for all film connoisseur
"," This film is dark , gritty and masterful Joaquain is seriously amazing as he perfects the joker and all supporting cast are great and build up an amazing film "
6386," Great psychological drama with many uncertainties.
"," Great artwork, wonderful soundtrack! It's an intense psychological rollercoaster with a talented Joaquin Phoenix: It's definitely Oscar-worthy. There are many questions left open: What is real and what is an illusion? Some viewers even speculate that the entire movie might be ""Arthur's"" psychotic illusion with exception of the last scene at Arkham hospital. Nobody knows. One can only speculate. But the uncertainty opens the way for many possible sequels. I am not quite sure how to interpret the ending (red foot prints). Is it symbolism oder does he kill the black social worker? Is Arthur Fleck real or is it just one of Joker's delusions? On a sociological scale the movie can also be interpreted as a warning: Good welfare system and good salaries are necessary, otherwise people might rebel and burn the cities. The mentally ill need better support. White old men can also be victims of society. That is not an exclusive privilege of black people. "

6389," Awesome movie
", Awesome standalone movie. I really didn't even think it needed to be a Batman movie nor does it at all fit into that universe. No way is this joker the Mastermind behind a criminal gang. Almost more like fan fiction. For what it is though it is very well made.

6393," An absolutely stunning film and performance!
"," Wow, just wow, incredible!! Never been a massive fan of Phoenix but what a performance, just give him the Oscar now because nobody will get anywhere near him! "
6394," The best of 2019 thus far. Oscar season is upon us!
"," Joaquin Phoenix absolutely owns this movie. i don't know what to say about this movie that hasn't been said yet, but go see it immediately. "
6395," Joker is a masterpiece
"," Forget about Marvel's summer blockbusters: Joker is not a superhero (or supervillain) flick.
It is a love letter to 1970s' and Martin Scorcese's cinema, and more especially The King of Comedy (1982), whose script Joker draws heavily upon. I strongly advise viewers to watch the two films one after the other to appreciate the influence Scorcese had on Phillips. You just have to consider these two films as twins, Joker being the deformed, nevrotic sibling of The King of Comedy.
Phillips' movie also presents an economic and social panorama of the end of 1970s America - although some might say this comment may still be true nowadays.
Phoenix is incredible: his performance is a real tour de force, an Oscar-winning one.
Of course, one could point out one or two flaws in the film, but overall Joker is the masterpiece everyone was waiting for. "
6396," What do you get when you cross Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips? You get what every Joker fan deserves.
",
6397," Bravo!!
"," The cinema was teen crowded, at first I guess they all went to see a new Batman entry and that in the end all of them would be dispointed with the outcome. I was wrong, the kids loved the movie and I was delighted with that.
Todd Philips Joker proves that one can do a thought provoking movie with a proeminent social analysis that can have effect on kids and grown ups.
Joker is a beautiful, raw and wonderfully played by Joachin Phoenix, best joker ever.
Rotten society can and would create monsters out of its outskirts ostracized people, this isn¬¥t just a movie, this is real life, in your face.
Bravo!!
10 STARS "
6398," The movie Joker deserved
", Going into this movie I expected an insane Joker movie that tied into the Batman universe with an old storyline from the comics but I have never been so glad to have been wrong about a movie Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker in such a unique and terrifyingly insane way that weirdly makes a more realistic Joker even more twisted and crazy when his actions are a result of a tragic life and insane world that beats him down again and again till only the clown remains.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job at misdirecting the audience making you think you know how its gunna go then switches it on you and leaves you looking the clown.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet go see it you will not be disappointed it's insanity is on another level. 
6399," Bit overrated(only slightly)
", I came into this screening with v high expectations it was pretty good tbf but bit predictable everyone needs to chill out with thus being their best film of all time. Heath ledger is a better joker but still give phoenix a damn Oscar 
6400," A must see for...everyone pat the age of 14
"," Joker is a film that I believe everyone should see at some point in their lives, it doesn't matter when, just once. This is a film that is scarily important and I think it's being criticized for all the wrong reasons. If you're a general fan of film see this film and if you're not see it anyway. Unless you are under the age of 15! "

6403," when you bring me out...can you introduce me as the Joker ?
"," If you got fed up reading about how brilliant Joaquin Phoenix was in Joker,I'm sorry but i have to say that it's absolutely 100% true. He brought the movie to life with his performance,his portrayal of depressed, lonely Arthur Fleck was relatable and his descent to madness justified. The cinematic score highlighted his acting really well. The cinematography and colour tone was mesmerising and well done. There are certain things that could've been done better with the story on the civil protests and certain scenes could've been changed up a bit.<br/><br/>The last act of the movie actually left me with goosebumps. A truly mesmerising cinematic experience. "
6404," Beware you may go crazy!
"," Just came out of the theater. The Laugh. I can say that Joaquin Phoenix has the best JOKER laugh. You may go crazy. Sometime I thought I would laugh out loud in the theater. The story is fantastic. From start to finish you will be hooked up.<br/><br/>It's a emotional roller costar. Director has nailed it. Awesome cinematography.
It's a no nonsense JOKER movie. NO THE BUILDING WON""T COLLAPSE FROM OUTER SPACE. BUT YOU WILL BURN A CIGARETTE AFTER THE MOVIE IF YOU ARE A SMOKER. "
6405," Insanely brilliant!

6406," 101 more joker remakes needed
"," This is a perception of a character in the batman universe that is much more clever than you initially think.
Firstly it's in my opinion that a Joker franchise is needed this movie left me wanting to watch a continued journey of the characters development and wanted to see it dig deeper, get darker, and make me feel even more discomfort. I love the R rated hero movies much more than the marvel movies but that may just be preference. I love gritty realities that push the boundaries.
And i see a dark but beautiful future for joker movies that contain no limits, no restrictions.
This movie depicts a series of events that no one really knows whether happened or did not. Except from the killing of Bruce Waynes parents.
Its a slow and well told tale and anyone who attempts to present a performance of an insane protagonist will prevail because there are no restrictions and it opens up a side to story telling and performance that really can go in any direction.
And i think both the actor and director produced a compelling piece of cinematography, that will be remembered by many "
6407," Absolute Masterpiece. Best movie of the year.
"," I have never written a review in my entire life, but I simply had to point out that you have to see this movie. 10/10

6415," To many things to think about
"," This movie is about everything. We've been discussing it over and over again with my friends finding new hidden meaning, symbols, idea. Planning to watch it again anytime soon. "
6416," Wow!!! A powerful portrayal of victim turned villain
"," The movie is slow in parts, but builds into the final emotive scenes with great skill and believability. Amazing acting from Joaquin Phoenix.
Are villains born that way, or made? The film reveals the latter for this Joker, building piece by piece why he becomes the murderous person of comic book fame. The themes presented, such as mental illness as a complex, multifaceted condition as well as the influence that nurture (or lack thereof) has upon future capacity and happiness are on trend (and believable). I was a bit disappointed by the final portrayal of his mother, as she was also a victim (as no doubt was the perpetrator of the crime that set both mother and son on their bitter and tragic trajectory). Our local newspaper rarely gives 5 star reviews, and the movie did not disappoint. I wanted to riot too! (against the unfairness of a system that tends to fail our most vulnerable.) It is not a new message, but one worth repeating. Thanks to the director, actors, crew and producers. "
6417," Amazing!!!!
", I can't wait to see this movie again!!! When is it coming out to buy???? My brother really enjoyed this movie also!!! 
6418," Not enough stars available!
", 10/10 doesn't do this movie justice. IMDB needs to make more stars available for the rating of this movie. That's all I'm gonna say. 
6419," Absolutely amazing
", I saw the movie last night and the despair you feel radiating off Arthur during the movie is amazing. The Joker leaves you utterly disturbed but loving it so much and questioning everything you just saw. The physiological roller-coaster you go through in this movie leaves you with so many questions and I can have a conversation for hours about the it. All of this wouldn't be like this if it wasn't for Joaquin Phoenix's stunning portrayal of the Joker the way he plays Arthur's slow decent into madness is absolutely amazing. The Joker has easily become my favorite movie of all time and think it would be a mistake for it not to be nominated for best picture. 
6420," JOKER - INSANE ACTING DC
"," No words to describe it's hands down EPIC . As usual DC proved its dark ,acting and acting only. Can't take your eyes off from Phoenix. In this fast paced world, we need movies like this sit, relax and enjoy the acting . 2019 is the year people stand by villains like thanos , joker üòÉ. It's theatre or laptop watch with peace "
6421," Incredible!!
"," Made me see it twice in the cinema.
Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation is incredible. "
6422," A welcome tribute to the 1970s filmmaking, with a twist
"," I like it. It's a serious film for adult audience which does not offend its intelligence. As if made in the 70s, the golden era of intelligent Hollywood filmmaking. The cinematography, the acting and the musical score are all excellent. For me, what makes the film more intriguing is the possibility that it plays a trick on the viewer. It seems to be constructed similarly to Nolan's Inception. In my opinion, almost the entire story is what Arthur F., a mental patient locked in an asylum, is retelling or remembering. Only the last minutes at the asylum we see in ""real"" time. Thus it's just a story imagined by a crazy person from New York in the early 1980s, who thinks he's Joker in Gotham City. "
6423," Smile
"," Each Joker in every film portrays a side that shows the diversity and uniqueness of this character. In third origin we see a dark truth, a real mental depth of what makes the Joker, smile and why he wants to make the world laugh. "
6424," I'm 100% sold!
"," Revealing the truth of the origin of all evil/anti-hero DC and MARVEL characters is the only way to help make sense of what drives these characters toward their goal of eliminating good. M. Night Shyamalan is one that can pull it off.
AWESOME, AWESOME MOVIE! "

Incredible acting by Phoenix. He truly was made for this role and interpretation of the Joker. This is a movie that I will love forever but won't need to watch again...yep. 
6429," 10/10 - A Masterpiece
"," A breath of fresh air when it comes to a super hero film. No CGI crap, just a combination of a great script, and surely an oscar winning acting performance from Joaquin Phoenix. I don't think I've seen better character development in a film, which ironically I can only relate to the Joker performance from Heath Ledger some time ago. Despite the unapologetic violence, you somehow feel yourself rooting for the Joker. I read recently that in an interview, Joaquin was asked if he had studied previous Joker performances, to gain a good understanding of what was expected. However, he advised that he did no such thing, and took a completely fresh approach to the character to ensure success. Yes the Joker is meant to be creepy, evil or twisted. But for the first time we see emotion from the Joker - human emotion that as a viewer we can understand and relate to.<br/><br/>I could go on and on.. but to conclude, this is the kind of film that only comes around every 5 years. A true masterpiece. "
6430," Bleak but utterly mesmerising
"," I found the bleakness of the plot in this movie a little hard to watch, but Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a complete masterpiece, as was the cinematography and musical score. I am glad I saw it in the cinema. I just think its a bit of a shame that it derives from a comic book. It could be the new taxi driver. "
6431," Masterpiece
",
6432," A good story with a complex character.
"," Over time we have had many versions of the Joker, that of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and that of Joaquin Phoenix, normally many ask the question of which of these is the best, that is a difficult question to answer since the Joker is a very complex character, I mean each of these Jokers works in its own adaptation. The film is simply above the average of the current Super-Heroes movies, for example this one does not have forced references and you could say that it has moments in which the film can make you laugh, but unlike other movies of This genre, these are not silly jokes. As I said this is different, this is not the typical story of a man who has natural skills, a villain to beat who wants to destroy the world, and that in the end he conquers it without any consequence, in fact it does not even feel from the Super Heroes genre, it's more of a madness exploration drama, because that's exactly what the Joker movie does, it teaches you how a man can transform into the Joker, it teaches you how madness leads you to do Many unimaginable things. For me the most realistic and more complex adaptation of the Joker would be this, without a doubt that of Ledger was very good, but Leger has more to be a former war veteran who wants to make chaos because there is a man in disguise playing the hero who a psychopath, however in this new version, this time Batman did not believe the Joker, this time it was the city who created it, which is more interesting because it is something never seen before (Well at least in a film of this genre ). I loved the environment of Gotham City, it is quite dark at the same time as credible, and it is perfect for the film, the color palettes of the film is perfect for each scene of this film, it feels that everything combines, and that everything is instead. That is why my favorite scene would be the first one, the colors combine perfectly, we see Arthur sitting painting, you understand that it is not that he is not happy, maybe he tries, but it is not, this you can easily understand because, while the It makes you smile forcefully, throw a tear, in a nutshell, this scene makes it clear to you how the movie will work and a raw story that probably does not have a happy ending, the best thing is that it tells you without any unique dialogue of the characters (except the radio). The character feels human, everything he does feels naturally, he doesn't feel forced or anything like that, something that I like and that I like very much personally is that the character evolves from being Artur Fleck to being the Joker, this change is You can tell when he murders his adoptive mother after learning that he cheated on many things, from there Arthur becomes the Joker, who honestly sees him as Joker is somehow the healthiest state we see, since that Arthur was a man who suffered abuse, he was hallucinating, and he really didn't know what to do with his life, as long as Joker could say he already knows who he is for the first time, he accepts himself as he is and has a clear goal. The hallucinations were very interesting, everything we saw in the movie just makes it clear that only two things were hallucinations, the rest is your decision whether it was real or not, words of the director. For me, everything starts to be a hallucination after Arthur stops taking his medications, since from here many things begin to happen that are conscientiously favorable to Arthur, for example, that he is invited to Murray's show, or that a complete revolution has been made thanks to him, I only say that if he could imagine a relationship with his neighbor, why couldn't he imagine a complete revolution in his favor? That's why the final scene would be the best in the movie, this is the one that makes you doubt if everything you saw is real, for example, generates questions like, how the hell did they catch him if he was next to a crowd? ? o Why is psychology coincidentally similar to that of the beginning? or also that this place is similar to what we saw almost at the beginning that the psychologist asked if he remembered why he was internship. The meaning of the film is what caused the most controversy, since this as in films like ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Fight Club"" among others can be misunderstood, as you may identify with what the characters say, if we live in an unfair society in which the rich get fat while the poor die of hunger, and that is why we have to make a revolution, and that is not what the film is transmitting to you, rather it could be something like you are not bad with others, do not treat others badly, or also what the movie wants to convey to you would really be something like what one of the background songs of this movie says that although others trample your dreams you don't have to let that depresses you, and that is the exact opposite of what Arthur did. I really do not find much to complain about this movie, I liked everything and if it has any error this will be justified with something like ""Remember that many things are hallucinating."" Even that doesn't really bother me. In conclusion Joker is a raw movie, which may make you feel uncomfortable, which is fine because it means that the movie is getting you emotions, which also means that you like the movie, this is a movie that explores its issues, with a great performance of Joaquin Phoenix worthy of an Oscar, with little action but with more than interesting moments, I hope they do not ruin it by taking a sequel, because he really does not need it, and if Black Panther an average movie does not stand out in nigun sense was nominated for Oscar, I don¬¥t see why this not, that is why the Joker earns its well deserved 9/10.

6438," Pretentious and Grim
"," Taxi Driver probably was not trying to be like another film, and it emerged as one of the greatest films of all time. Rather than trying to be itself, Joker tries really, really hard to be Taxi Driver, which misses the point of what innovative filmmaking is. Arthur Fleck is a mentally-ill loser who lives a miserable life, and audiences get to share his misery for two hours. Much as the film strives to be like Taxi Driver, Joaquin Phoenix strives to be Travis Bickle or at least outdo Heath Ledger, which makes Phoenix's difficult performance pale by comparison. This Joker is such a loser that he seem improbable to become a worthy nemesis for Batman. "
6439," Phil Dunphy is funnier in Modern Family
"," I was so keen to see this film as I haven't heard so much hype about a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>It's a very good film, but all the rave reviews will lead you to believe that it's the ""best film ever""....even surpassing Dark Knight. When in reality its an above average movie.<br/><br/>I must hand it to Joaquin Phoenix though as I haven't seen many of his movies and the swift transition from Phil Dunphy to Joker is genius. "

"," This movie does match the hype and you can ignore the arguments about its one note social commentary. This society doesn't make the Joker but it definitely doesn't help Arthur in not becoming him. The performances are stunning, and this Joker feels insane, not the calculating criminal mastermind of The Dark Knight. Watch it. Stunning, dark, mesmerising and brutal... "
6444," How psycopaths and serial killers are born
"," Joker wins its audience by giving its suffering protagonist a satisfying revenge, which is very good but nothing so significant or groundbreaking about it, Nothing except for Phoenix's tour-de-force performance.
The movie came out exactly as I had expected it to be , playing it safe in terms of the story, a pretty conventional one and the trailers obviously demonstrate that, How psycopaths are born? How the society with its cruelty brings out the worst -or maybe the innermost true identities- of human beings ?<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I thought it lacked the uniquely authentic vibes of Scorsese's Taxi Driver &amp; The King of Comedy , Come on you had Phoenix himself , The man who gave one of the best performances I have ever seen in my life in The Master , but I think that's what you get when you -out of craving Hype- propose a daring idea like this to a big studio owning the rights to an exceptional character like DC's The Joker ,you won't make full use of Phoenix's talent, because whatever he does as the Joker , people will approve ..
This is my major problem with this movie , it is craving popularity .. People started comparing Phoenix to Ledger even before the movie came out ,
I think that movie would have worked as a character study away from DC ,
Now for Joaquin Phoenix's performance ,DAMN,
That man is unstoppable since The Master and you were never really here , He keeps pushing the boundaries and he doesn't seem to care about that ,
His crying laughter , his body performance and That scene towards the end of the movie when he shot Murray and then sat still tapping the floor with his feet and then walked around while smiling , I was mesmerized ,
That man is a living legend and he channels his real-life agony through his performance,I really can't find the words to praise it.
As for the Cinematography , JAW-DROPPING
The score suits the melancholic atmosphere of the movie
Todd Philips deserves the credit for giving the role to Phoenix but deserves the blame for directing a movie about the Joker which could have exceptional on its own as a comic book movie and Phoenix could have been any deranged serial killer/Psycopath in any movie and he
would be perfect as usual.<br/><br/>One other thing , Phoenix deserves an Oscar but I think he could be snubbed by the Academy because of the backlash the movie is getting for promoting violence, which I find absurd and silly of course "
6445," One of the best performances!!!
", Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor and he continues to prove that right. I'm not comparing with Heath ledger because his performance was one of the best I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix was a satisfying take on the joker and I couldn't ask for any better. 
6446," Will the Joker ever leave Joaquin?
"," This is a performance which comes about once in 40-50 years. This is not even acting , he has become that character. Method acting to another level. The script and direction are impeccable. The cinematography is intimate, mostly shot in close up with zoom lenses.
The background score complements the emotions of every scene.
This film is closest to perfection, if something like it even exists.
I've been an actor in Bollywood for 13 years and a student of film all my life and I have to admit I have not seen this level of acting in many decades.

6449," Typical Cinematic Tragedy
"," I went to see this not having read reviews, but hearing some good things from some of the hype, and hype it is. There are some serious fan boys that are out of touch with what makes a good movie. I call this a cinematic tragedy because like so much in movies now-a-days, there are some great elements to it but the story, direction, or core elements fall flat somehow.<br/><br/>One thing that everyone is getting right is that Phoenix does an outstanding job. Perhaps too goog. The director, editor, producer, or whoever is responsible can't seem to take the camera off him. Yes, he's the titular character, but how many damn times do we need to see him dancing to music that's only in his head or to his own reality? Many, many times. The damn movie even closes with a slow motion of it. We get it. He's crazy.<br/><br/>And that is one of the things that hurts the whole theme to the movie. Aurthur is a sad sap of a character. Lives with his mom, crappy job that he looses and has probably had issues with maintaining employment in the past, looses his public mental health support, lives in a city that is full of trash, super rats. Because Aurthur is the solo, main character and are stuck with his close up, we are supposed to, and do identify with his plight. I feel that we are supposed to cheer him on when he kills. He's celebrated as a hero of the impoverished, the downtrodden. But that's the rub. It's not necessarily society that has pushed him over the edge, it's the fact that he's totally nuts. A normal person wouldn't do these things. And if the movie showed a perfectly normal person snapping in a reasonable way, then that would give weight to the theme. So there's a big fat contradiction to all the effort that the movie is going through.<br/><br/>---minor spoilers---<br/><br/>Also, there's really no story. Solo movies like this that are an exploration in character typically have the same character as the antagonist. After all, the whole movie is told from his point of view. What I mean is, Author is crazy, he killed, he knows killing is wrong, he's at odds with it, and the movie is a struggle between right and wrong. Not here. Well, maybe there's an outside force acting against him to create conflict or tension. Not here (there is a minor police investigation, but we're not shown its progress, so we don't even know if Authur is in any danger). Is he hatching some scheme to make a grand statement against the growing class gap? Not at all, so nothing to thwart there. There's just no story.<br/><br/>---end of minor spoilers---<br/><br/>It's strictly an exercise in character development that can not sustain 2 hours. There was a story here, but the movie ended before anything could be done with it. This whole movie gets us to the beginning of an act 2 then fizzles out. "
6450," My favourite movie now
"," I knew for sure that this would become one of my favourite movie! Best performance EVER! Phoenix's acting is just so in depth that I could almost overlap my pathetic part of self on him. Definitely have to watch multiple times!!! Quote from anonymous ""While Marvel builds its supervillains with super power, clever brain, money and weapons; DC just gives him a pathetic life"".. All the chaos, insanity, cruelty and indifference is making so much sense now.. It's about how much trauma one would need to become Joker.. It may seem ironic that this guy wants to be a comedian while his whole life is an absolute tragedy, but somehow I feel that the best comedy is always inherently a tragedy. People make fun of something as if in this way they could relieve the pain that they are suffering from. In this sense, I am completely empathetic with his painful and possibly self-mocking laughter condition...Phoenix's performance is just too good and profound, that I almost forgot the cinematography and BGM is just as good as anything else.

It is normal for the film to be +18 because the film has a heavy psychological pressure and the film deals with a somewhat dangerous subject, ""Anarchism.. There are 2-3 bloody scenes, because of psychological pressure, these bloody scenes can evoke a sense of violence.

"," First of all we should all admit that phoenix is one of the most important actors in the world and most under rated one. see him in joker he lost almost half of his weight dance and do reactions with his face, smile and laugh really hard, he is really legend. the music also was amazing and exciting. but the only objection i have on this movie is the story line and the build of the joker character i think it could be more conflict and suffering but at all it's not a weakness point. the movie is great and will move your feelings hard. "
6456," Amazing
", Others said it before me. Joaquin deserves an Oscar for his rol as the Joker!! Dont need a lot of words to recommend this movie. Just watch!! Its amazing. Very good and emotional storyline. Good camerawork. Good acting. Good music. 
6457," Empathy provoking classic, great film!
"," Very rarely do I watch a modern movie that makes me feel like I've seen something special but this film really struck a chord. The portrayal of Joker from Phoenix is a masterclass and he will surely win an oscar for this performance. What I loved about the movie was how much you empathise with the character and pity his life. Its about as far from a typical supehero film as you can get, not a great deal of action as it focuses instead on the psychological path of Joker's creation. Left me feeling quite emotional for a good while afterwards. "
6458," One of the most depressive title I'd ever seen! Please keep young or happy people away of this movie.
",
6459," Most overrated film of the year
", Sorry but this film is rated a 9 on IMDB?! How I will never know...The film is so painfully average and depressing it's an absolute disgrace that this film has got the air time it has. 
6460," Well acted, but also a bit Implausibly at some points
"," Phoenix is again playing absoultly fantastic. He gives everything he can. Robert DeNiro also does a great Job. Some scenes are brillant (Subway), but other Things dont make sense to me. For example: why is Arthurs stand up recorded? If this Film would play in 2019 this would make sense, but 1980? Not really. Also its a bit unrealistic, that Arthur is shown in one of the most famous Shows in the City and than nobody is remembering him, when they See him on the street. Also i didnt really understand why the invitation to the TV Show had to be Real. A twist like in Requiem for a dream would have been better. The protests are a good idea, but i think Phillips should have been explaining more about the other parts of the society. It comes a bit out of nothing, that the Total anarchy is breaking out. "
6461," DC Executives Ruin Another Character
"," Honest review. You have heard what great acting, Phoenix should get an Oscar, etc. Yes, the acting, directing, music, lighting, was all great. The problem is that this movie never should have been made. I collect comics and enjoy comic book movies because they are fantastical, an escape; this movie is neither. There is enough dark crap going on in the world to have to also have this character turned into some screwed in the head, abused, mentally ill, psychopathic murderer. The Joker has always been fun because there was always a bit of mystery about him; the actual Joker is a guy that just gets his kicks out of messing with Batman in every way imaginable. This Joker is not fun, he's a damaged. If you see this movie, don't review it right away, let it simmer for a few days as I have done. For me, when it comes right down to it this movie would have been better off never having been made. Further, those currently at the helm at Warner Brothers have NO IDEA how to handle their properties. They have been handed characters greater than anything Marvel has ever had, or will ever have, and they insist on mismanaging every one of them. I dread The New Gods coming out after sitting through Joker. The amount of money they are bringing in from this movie will make them believe they have finally done something right, they have not. This movie has nothing to it that will last, it has not added anything of quality to the DC Universe, or Batman mythology at that. Go see it, you will probably like it, I liked the production of it, I just wish it was never made and I will never watch it again. It's just not part of any comic book world I ever want to believe in. "
6462," It's Rob Zombie's Halloween in the Batman Universe
"," I'm not a big super hero movie fan at all. And I really can't stand the ridiculous Marvel cross-over movies with 72 story lines and 55 Avengers running around. But this sounded different and intriguing and there was lots of buzz. Sadly, it falls pretty flat for me. The performances were preachy and predictable, but not necessarily bad. Just not that engaging. The moral here is simple. Don't be a jerk to people, no matter their socio-economic or mental state. Fine, I get that. Despite what people have said, I'm not sure it's really glorifying violence, though pretty much all the characters in the film are d-bags and seem to have it coming. But my real problem is that so little happens. I don't need tons of explosions or CGI, but the basic backstory could have been handled in 45 minutes, then move into some actual crime or something.<br/><br/>This really reminded me of Rob Zombie's remake of the Halloween movie. On the one hand I appreciate doing something different. On the other hand it starts to creep into preachy pretentiousness. And do we really need our psychotic killers to all be sympathetic? At one point I was wishing for Jared Leto's Joker to show up and wisk me away. So I appreciate the effort, but this won't be the definitive Joker film for me. "
6463," Jared Leto who?
"," While this movie is not a relaxed and easy watch it is a must see. With a haunting performance and well constructed story you will be left satisfied. If you want a ""super hero"" movie this is not it. I would compare it to taxi-driver or you were never really here. "
6464," Joker will kill muray, his mother and his friend
"," Arthur was imagining his girlfriend
Hahahahahaahahah
üòàüòàüòàüòà "
6465," Missed Opportunity, but Phoenix grabbed an Oscar
"," First of all, lil bit spoilers ok ! dont read if you wanna know nothing.
Ok . first CONS of this movie:
1.)Thomas Wayne and Wayne corp is portrayed like an Evil ..
2.)Little Bruce Wayne is potrayed like a autistic child.
3.)If you look closely, the story is hundred times watched social analysis of individaul who is strugling against ""system""...
4.) Ending is waaay to ""ok im done and tired, lets write it quickly, let the fans make their own judgement about ending and what it is,..
5) the biggest flop in my eyes was the scene in ready room in the robert de niro show when Fleck asked about introducing like a joker... jesus christ its a JOKER movie so that sentence should be DARK, underlined with gritty and dark music theme .. JOKER... can you introduce me as ..... bu bum bummm JOKER ... get it ?
6) Stupid and so common relevances to todays Donald Trump era.. Joaquin is middle class (both democrats or republicans voter) and Wayne is Donald Trump-esque character.. And the gotham is post-election world with tension.. So obvious yet so boring . trump is your president, deal with it..<br/><br/>PROs:
1) Joaquin Phoenix. I was sceptical but legendary acting here.
2) Music , sound , cinematography, colours and dialogues.
3) twists , halucinations vs reality
4) Fridge
5) Connection to the Waynes murder / bridge to batman
6) Overally not boring at all, i guess minimum of cliech√©s
7) dont do a sequel.. no need .. its perfect as origin for this character even tho nobody knows (not even writters) if HE was the REAL joker or just catalyst for creating one . "
6466," Great movie, BUT !!
"," It's great movie and wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix , but the problem is the movie makes you empathizes with joker character and hates Tomas Wyne , and the movie's intention is encouraging violence and criminality. "
6467," Great movie with a bit of flaws!
"," When i went to watch joker i was a bit nervous to watch it, especially because the night before i had re-watched ""the dark knight"" (still a great film). One of the BEST parts of this movie was heath ledgers portray of joker! I was a concerned if joaquin phoenix could pull off a better joker, well right after watching this movie... all of MY concerns were gone. This movie is probably one of the greatest comic book movies of the year ( and i'm a big marvel fanboy). The cinematography in this film is great, i was worried about the direct todd philips doing a bad job but he did pretty good! The way the film looked was great for a movie like this which is meant to be dark and disturbing. Joaquin did a FANTASTIC job as joker, everything he did from the joker laugh to the way he acted felt like if i was watching JOKER. This movie is 2 hours long but due to it's slow pacing it felt much longer, which of course is great considering how good this was. Flaws: The one big flaw i had was the scene in which we find out the woman arthur has been ""dating"" his just a figment of his imagination, this was a bit cheesy but at the same time shows how broken arthur in this film that he has to go to the point where he has to imagine this sort of stuff. I didn't like this much and it was a bit confusing once i found this out, overall didn't bother me to much but it is my biggest flaw. One thing i found i bit disappointing was the final act, i imagined it being WAY LONGER, and i know i know this wasn't a marvel movie which has its big cgi final fight scenes (i also really the shot and music playing while joker is in the police car) overall not a big flaw without these 2 little things i think this would be a 10/10. OH and robert de niro does a great job in this film. Nobody really does a bad job in this film. So that was joker, a great film, a great comic book film and overall would definitely check this one out again and you should!<br/><br/>9.5/10 "
6468," You joking at me?
"," If you ignore the ""greatest film ever"" shouts from people who have probably never watched a non comic book movie this a surprisingly strong effort. It goes all out in its attempts to re-imagine a fairly one note villain as the subject of a Scorsese outsider character study and actually manages to escape from under the weight of its much referenced influences to stand as its own take on the subject. It might not have much new to say but the outstanding cinematography and a top form Joachim Phoenix lift the film above the usual genre fair and only occasionally overblown direction and a clunky, completely unnecessary ""evil society"" monologue hold it back. "
6469," Well made
"," I was pleasantly surprised by the tone of the movie, that's between grim and surreal with occasional grotesque moments, underlined by an outstanding use of music. Phoenix is freakin good, I liked much his laugh. The character development is good.
On the other hand, Joker comes a bit short in the ending, when you expect a climax that's nowhere to be found. Phoenix acting becomes a little stale also, when it should have delivered the final punch. Another flaw (or it's more a doubt maybe) is the glorification of social revenge. I didn't like the unnecessary rude depiction of Wayne at all. Overall, it's a well made and well directed movie, that could have had more substance. And as usual nowadays, a nice movie that's heavily marketed suddenly becomes a masterpiece for the masses. 6.5 stars. "
6470," Great Movie
"," Especially when he kills the broadcaster right in the head after he blamed him and the whole society because of the bad discrimination. and when he stands above the car and dancing for the success of his sudden revenge.
but some scenes are cut off not completed nor started perfectly, scenes like when he goes to Tomas's house suddenly and when he kills his mother without letting her talk or have any expression. It made me sleepy at some long drama moments especially with music. "
6471," Character genius?
"," Excellent performance from joaquin and the setting is perfect.
But the character of the joker is questionable to my opinion. He does not reflect the mastermind of crime he used to be. To me he is not (or will not become) the genius man to set up major crime events with other criminal organisations.
And to set up the population to riot by eliminating a populair celebrity host is not realistic to me. "
6472," anti capitalist movement from a crazy white dude
"," The critics is quick to whack down this movie as empty but it did caught what society had done to this character. it's sad, depressive, with no mental health to help him through his dark period turning to violence as a substitute for drugs and the help he needed. Joaquin Phoenix was good in this dark character and i hope he will be nominated for oscar 2020. "
6473," Disturbing
", The performance of Joaquin Phoenix was iconic but the story was disturbing the violance was high during the movie and psychological games was annoying its seems that the director and the author was intentionally make the audience feel disturbed really big shout for them because they success with me 
6474," Joker moves you with his character portrayal. It's muft watch.
"," Everyone is awful these days. #Joker
#JoaquinPhoenix just draws himself into one of the most iconic and devastating beautifully villain of cinematic history. He is thunderous masterpiece. #todphillips delivers an intelligent film with meaningful messages. "
6475," Joachim Phoenix after this movie will always be joker
"," Really the acting of Joachim Phoenix deserves all the greetings for this movie that are heard thought these days. But we have to consider some facts. First of all the story of Batman from another point of view is really smart, it deserves your attention. the main concept of the movie is that the results of continuous bulling to a person can lead to great outbursts of anger and violence that is the fact, so imagine now that person to be emotionally unstable like Joker(that is the moment that joker is born). Also I want to mention that the smoking propaganda through the whole movie is really outrageous. "
6476," I wish I'd brought some sandwiches
"," This was an intriguing story of a bloke who longs to be a clown. How does one get on ' the clown ladder ' you may ask? What does it take to become a successful clown such as Sir Ronald McDonald? All of these questions are answered in the film and more. The film starts by introducing the lad Arthur who is severely underweight, depleted nutritionally &amp; quite possibly insane. Arthur is intent on becoming the best clown in Gotham, after struggling to gain momentum Arthur turns his hand to the stage, again with little success. It is at this point that Arthur garners the attention of the rozzers, his anti social behaviour also lead to an asbo and a dressing down from Batman's dad. After being called all the idiots under the sun by Batman senior Arthur goes absolutely mental and shoots a few people.
I for one will never trust another clown as long as I live, I also fully support the proposal to stop and search all clowns in the street for Arms, ammunition &amp; drugs. They're out of control and must be brought to justice. The lad in IT 1 &amp; 2 does the clown population no favours either. "
6477," others did it better
"," That's the TL:DR: others simply did it better. Both the ""man reaches breaking point and becomes violent"" / ""slow descent into madness"" and the Joker himself.<br/><br/>The long of it is: this is by no means a bad movie. Neither is it mind-blowing. Given it had the best ingredients in the world to work with, aka Joaquin Phoenix and a nice cast all around and obviously wonderful art direction, costuming etc, it was a serious let-down. Especially since it so easily could have been great. So yes, I rate my expectations.<br/><br/>I also rate my emotions and cringing in shame on behalf of a person for 2 hours is precisely not how I want a joker movie to make me feel. This is the sad sack loser joker nobody asked for (before and after the supposed transformation). There is nothing cathartic about seeing him beat random people up, you just cringe even more at his delusions that everybody is personally out to get him.<br/><br/>To be more specific: the characters arc did not fit with the narrative they were going for in my opinion and the portrayal did not ring true to the ""Joker"" actions for me. Too much sadness, too little repressed rage. It didn't help at all that we got overly dramatic music to underscore every moment of defeat instead of letting us take things in quietly. The music killed most of the important moments for me. I also consider it a sign of the movie needing to cue in its audiences to what they're supposed to feel, like the flashback reiterating the big reveal that was already made clear in the dialogue between the two people.<br/><br/>There was also, as others have pointed out, nothing funny about the movie. While humor might be subjective, I've always been a fan of gallows humor and as somebody who was laughing and crying at myself simultaneously because my pitiful situation was just so ridiculous, I thought I would be able to sympathize with Arthur when he realizes that his life is one big joke. Nope, not a chance. See, Arthur is not the (awesome!) Comedian. Jeffrey Dean Morgan perfectly embodies the sentiment they were going for in 30 seconds where this whole movie can't manage it. Arthur takes himself very very seriously and he can't stand people laughing about him, much less is he able to do it himself. So how does that fit in with everything being a joke to him? Not at all, obviously! Because we can't have an accurate portrayal of this one person's mental health, we need to shoehorn in some ""typical"" Joker actions and statements that are at odds with the character. In ascribing them to this particular character, they are also robbed of the exact flamboyance and joy they should normally transport. Yes, joy, or at least satisfaction. The joker in my favorite iterations (Ledger and Hamill, though the new game voice is in line with the sentiment) clearly enjoys what he is doing. No joy to be had in this movie though.<br/><br/>The only legitimately good moment was when the whole audience in the cinema started laughing when Arthur killed Randall. Problem is, the funny thing was the pointlessness and the absurdity of it all in context, so it was a laugh at the expense of the movie and not one of approval.<br/><br/>My personal view: save yourself the ticket money and 2,5 hours of a torturous journey that goes nowhere, both personally and narratively and re-watch Ledger or your favorite animated episodes. "
6478," This movie is a joke!!!!!
"," I was looking forward to watching this movie for a number of months. As far as the movie as a whole, it's a fractured compilation and is very difficult to sit through. On the other hand, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was excellent for the role he portrayed. Overall I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>**Spoiler alert**. How could they change how Bruce Wayne's father died in this movie compared to other versions?????? "
6479," Not a Christopher Nolan movie
", I watched joker i enjoyed the acting of joaquin Phoenix..Direction is very good but lackes of twists. First half is good and second half is terrorize you.. don't compare with The Legend Heath Ledger ..and Christopher nolan ..i gave 8 star only for Joaquin Phoenix

And don't listen to the magazines, please watch this movie, because they were all talking how Jlo should receive an Oscar for The Hustlers and I listened to them and wasted my money on a cinema ticket for that contentless ""clip on a phone"" All in all, give that man an Oscar "
6486," ""That's life""
"," (My English is not perfect because I'm French üòâ)<br/><br/>I understand that this film divides because it disturbs and creates deep discomfort from beginning to end. The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is breathtaking and deserves an Oscar. Philipps would be entitled to this honor for the staging. The music is ... just ... perfect!<br/><br/>""Joker"": a future cult film, no offense to his detractors. Stanley Kubrick's ""Mechanical Orange"" (1971) has become one. "
6487," A beautiful, haunting portrayal of an infamous clown
"," Best associated with anarchy and uncontrollable chaos, the film takes you through a twisted series of events that propel a man on the verge of insanity, to jump off this steep pinnacle with glee.<br/><br/>Here, the titular protagonist isn't heralded or framed as a solution, but rather as a deadly consequence of an ignorant society, that nearly drove itself insane in the process.<br/><br/>Diagnosed as heavily demented and severely mentally disordered, Joker is a film that'll have you laughing at the wrong moments, where comedy is used as a means of destruction, promoting stress rather than relieving it.<br/><br/>Blurring the canonical line between fantasy and reality, it is a careless and mesmerizing descent into madness. "
6488," WOWOWOWOW
"," We, today, saw this at the Llandudno Cineworld and I can honestly say this was one of the most incredible cinematic experiences I have ever had.<br/><br/>I went in expecting a Chris Nolan-esque Joker back story but what I got was a nerve jangling exploration of a mentally ill mans descent into madness and criminality. Joker is about as much to do with DC as Jaws is about a shark. The tension created on screen was off the scale, so much so, that the graphic violence provided respite from the character development.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the critics have been saying about Joker but saw that Metacritic is only at 54% - this I cannot understand, yes it leans on The Kind of Comedy but surpasses that picture easily.<br/><br/>Go and see this film!

6493," A Psychological and Sociological Masterpiece.
"," Everyone should watch this movie, and we should talk about it with young people and in the media. Why? If we put aside the amazing acting, directing and cinematography, it's an enormously important movie for our time. When society overshoots its sustainable capacities, when leaders get so distanced from the people, when we forget about kindness, empathy and mental health... we give birth to those who bring violent change, those who incite anger, fear and exclusivity. Then, all hell breaks loose. Is that the developing direction of our modern civilization? "
6494," Mixed Bag
"," Good-outstanding visuals and direction-a few great scenes.
Bad-this movie is a poorly structured remake of Taxi Driver-basically a what if premise-what if Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver became the Joker. Great comic book villains or movie villains in general all have superior abilities-this Joker while evil and violent is rather deficient in intelligence which lessens the the experience. So if you love the movie Taxi Driver you will love this movie. If not, you won't. "
6495," Ummm stand alone yes but otherwise not true to story
",
6496," Tread Carefully.. You May Be Disappointed
",
6497," Superb acting but poor directing, poor character development
"," Joaquin Phoenix acting was superb, but the director failed to make audience feel the character development of the joker becoming evil, mastermind of crime and manipulative. Director make audience feel that the Joker is weak, pathetic, bullied by society, yes he did a great job, we do feel sympathize for Joker. However the message of Joker becoming a killer, evil mastermind was poorly conveyed and portrayed. It feels like all of the sudden, Arthur Felix able to kill people without actually showing motive to kill people, he doesn't seems to be enjoy killing people. Joker supposedly enjoy committing crime he planned and he laugh whenever he enjoys it. But in the movie, Joker is still weak and pathetic until the end. "
6498," boring with interesting bits
"," I was bored for a lot of joker especially during the first half,the only thing keeping me watching was joaquin and some interesting moments.<br/><br/>Those interesting moments were what pushed the movie into ok territory.<br/><br/>Its a one and done movie for me, watched once and thats enough as i just didn't see the masterpiece everyone is raving about. "
6499," We create monsters ! Joker is a good movie, monsters are not born but created by the society.
"," When you are surrounded by poverty, increasing crime, violence and claws of capitalism dig deeper and deeper into your skin you can not react any other way than going insane. In a Gotham, city which is on brings of collapse we meet this young, troubled man and see how he transforms into the vile creature with disregard to life.<br/><br/>How to live in a dump? How to cope ? Mental condition, ugly apartment, long commutes, awful job (which made Arthur happy to some degree). How to survive. It is a really difficult task when you have streets littered with rubbish, businesses going bust and packs of viscous teenagers running the streets and causing problems. The rich has forgotten those who are less fortunate. Rich part of the society turn the blind eye. They do not have solution, they see it as an opportunity. Thomas Wayne wants to become a mayor not out of goodness of his heart but to reinforce his position of power in the society.<br/><br/>Super rich of Gotham are obsessively wealthy and feel that they are in control. This story erupts when One day, three bankers, elite of Gotham pick up on the wrong man. Arthur defends himself and through his actions commits first degree triple murder. A sociopath is born. Gotham a created this monster, society did create this vile entity. We create modern Jokers, we push people over the edge with our despicable actions or lack of any attempts in helping those in need.<br/><br/>But when the monster is born we do not blame ourselves, oh no, we do not. We just see them as the abomination but what it is is nothing else than waste created by us. We did this. We created joker.<br/><br/>Arthur's mommy was writting to Mr Wayne asking for help, whether she was sane or not that has never been answered in the movie but her screams for help were left unanswered and this lack of action was one more reason for Joker to abandon set norms and be this energy of evil pulling people in similar situation to him.<br/><br/>Joker breaks, he rejects all the norms. The boundary of what is right and wrong is so blurred tha he finds no problem with brutally murdering people who wronged him or will wrong him. The war between rich and poor has begun. Poor people inspired by the brutal murders and thanks to slimy media are interpreting unfortunate events in the as a response of the poor. The truth is that Joker become a symbol for those who want to release their anger and frustration. No more ! They fight back and follow psychopath who kills because he become empty, rejected shell.<br/><br/>Movie is dark and worth watching. Phoenix did play Joker really well. It is easy to draw comparisons between legendary Keith Ledger role but I would rather see his performance as his own interpretation of the Joker character. It is movie about evil side of human nature. There is only despair and misery, there is not Batman in this movie, the balance is on the side of evil. You will not find solace here. "

As u all know the movie is about Joker's origin, I dont even want to reveal the plot but I cant keep my mouth shut bcoz it's well written story and well executed. Everything about the movie is excellent, the pace of the story is slow, it's not a cons, it gave enough time to care for the characters around and its also the main reason to feel the elevation of the movie in last 20 mins, the climax was mind blowing.

I feel it hasn't been appreciated by many people, even though it is currently rated 9/10 on IMDb. Joaquin was nothing short of extraordinary as an actor. His acting in the movie is chilling. The story and the act perfectly sets up the future joker played by Heath Ledger. It is a dark movie and I understand some people might not enjoy that. But then that doesn't take anything away from the brilliance of this movie.. The movie is exactly what it is supposed to be. Rarely do the movies live up to the hype, and this one did it. It was refreshing to see this unique movie in which superhero doesn't save the world. "
6506," Go see it right now!!!
"," 10/10 this movie will have a cult-like following similar to American Psycho. I had know idea Todd Phillips was capable of producing a movie like this. It touched on hard pressing social issues such as isolation, suicide, poverty, mental illness and everything in between. This was movie was set pre social media but I imagine that was touched on as well because social media is destroying us as people but I digress. The movie is going to make the comic book fans of joker go nurs because it's the closest thing to that you will see with the hard R rating some brutal stuff. Somewhere my fellow comic book nerds are all secretly hoping Todd Phillips now directs an Arkham Asylum movie *fingers crossed* this movie is epic do yourself a favor go to the theater and see it. "

6509," Decent, not great
"," A decent flick, that's a character study on the man before the Joker rather than the theatrics of a Zack Snyder mess of a film. I find that the movie, although interesting enough, only justified the 'what' of the Joker, and not enough of the How and Why of the Joker "

"," Absolutely loved this movie which i watched today.<br/><br/>I am, and still are a massive fan of Heath Ledgers definition of the Joker but i,m afraid Joaquin Phoenix has tabled Heaths performance for me, however this is a completely different take on the Joker i believe and a big statement of course.<br/><br/>Jack Nicholson is also one of my favourite actors of all time and played a blinder as we all know, however all actors have played this character in a different era.<br/><br/>The movie focuses ... if you like the rise of the Joker and how the City and the gotham people and even his foster parent mother turned Arthur Fleck into a monster.<br/><br/>This movie really has a new side to it and a touch of class/darkness missing from all previous movies involving the Joker charachter, whats missing was the joker alone movie of course which we now have,,, i should add that Christopher Nolans trilogy and Tim Burtons versions of batman were fantastic i have to say and i,m a big fan of those.<br/><br/>I just hope viewers can understand this particular movie is of course not a batman movie,its also violent, its sad, its funny, it really is what it is... it is also the birth if you like of the Joker who is one of Batmans biggest archenemy...<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next Joker V Batman from this franchise (i hope)<br/><br/>Phoenix V Pattinson fingers crossed<br/><br/>Well done<br/><br/>9/10 "

"," A movie which you can not forget. A must watch movie for all the DC fans. Acting, cinematographer, screenplay, direction, BGM everything are so perfect. A must deserving movie for the Oscars. "
6513," Finally, Joaquin Shines!
"," I usually consider Joaquin Pheonix as an average actor. Lately, I haven't seen much movies starring him, until now. He did a great job as a character who starts out as strange, but sympathetic, to the outright villian we all know him as. While Heath Ledger also did a great job, we didn't get to know his character from the beginning, unlike this take. While Bruce Wayne does make two appearances, we only see him as a kid and briefly. A very risky, but interesting take on The Joker. Joaquin Phoenix should at least get nominated for an Oscar! "

I wish there had been more drama and action scene in it.<br/><br/>It is worth to watch if you know enough about previous DC movies.

I honestly forgot during the movie that i was watching an actor and not a really mentally disturbed person. His movements, his expressions , his laughter and the way he talked deeply unnerved me . His eyes were so expressive, especially in the last scene , when you could actually feel what was not said. He deserves all the Oscars in the world for this movie . I believe i have never watched such a haunting performance.
The director did a remarkable job too but you can barely look away from the protagonist to realise how good the film in general is. "

"," I have watched every Batman movie, or movies/series related to Batman. Joaquin Phoenix is a terrible actor. He over acts and is not good at his trade. I rate him as one of the ""worse"" Jokers. Even the Lego Joker is better than him. I don't believe he has ever watched a Batman show or series. He plays a detached person that just happens to play a clown. Nothing to do with being the ""joker"", ""clown"" yes. I couldn't want to see this movie and once it started, I was bored to tears. At least there was some relationship to Bruce Wayne and his parents. If it wasn't for that and the fact that the movie took place in an imaginary Gotham City, a person would not have been able to relate this move to a DC villain. Please wait to see this movie when it hits HBO and it's free. Not worth the trip to the movies, and if Phoenix wins an award, just shows how screwed up the system is. Heath Ledger put his heart in to this same character, not to be said about Phoenix. "
6528," Amazing and refreshing.
"," Disturbing, realistically dark, and jaw-dropping. Joker pushes all the right buttons to make a cohesive and convincing journey into madness. Psychologically tolling and chilling scenes will take you off your feet
..
Expertly crafted and an ALL TIME performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Todd Phillips really surprised me with his ability to construct a drama/thriller. This movie will go down as the most memorable movie of 2019. Hopefully they expand upon this universe further; it would be nice to see Joaquin helm this character again. Although, this man is an artist, and it doesnt seem in his nature to join a superhero franchise. One can hope though, right? I need to see this film again and again another time to give it my perfect 10 score...I'm on the fence about a 9 or 10 because of some minor gripes that may even disappear with a second viewing. Don't miss this spectacle! "
6529," Amazingly well acted, very clever, not what I was expecting
"," Great film, in my opinion only really 2 main characters, Joker and Murray, very clever, not a typical comic book movie, if anything, quite a sad film but without the audience feeling sad, more intrigued to see where it is going, but you will already know the answer, as there is no surprises, but that does not make it any less a movie, if anything, it enhances it, so impressive. "
6530," Moments of brilliance
"," Very good. Moments of brilliance. The pace seemed very slow and dragging. I wouldn't put it up in the category of all time classics like Godfather or Taxi Driver...A couple of minor plot holes for me. Why did they keep broadcasting for so long when he was the guest on TV instead of immediately cut away? The character went from a sensitive person to just being shallow, superficial and actually approving 'crazy for crazy's sake'. That seemed like a cop out way to handle the story arch and hugely diminished the build up of the character. So he ends up just another A-hole...so what?. I was hoping for a little more than that. What happened to his girlfriend and her daughter (and did he even care if she was horribly killed)? "
6531," Ledger still the Best Romero2nd
", Hold the Oscar talk as I finally watched this brooding boring movie that definitely disappoints after reading all the accolades laid at its feet. Whoever green lighted the direction this movie took should be fired for straying so far away from DC expectations. No amt of weird prancing by Phoenix can salvage this disjointed mess and the underlying theme of child abuse causing maniacal behaviour is just depressing tho lends a foreboding undercurrent of danger. It has 2 red herrings disguised as blockbuster revelations one less so than the other---if you watched it then you can figure it out. It lacked the elegance and evil present in Silence of the Lambs as Phoenix is no Hopkins and Phillips no Demme--DC movies should be thrilling which this is not--arthouse style has its place but should not occupy the whole movie and not in the DC universe--it was like unwrapping an elaborately decorated gift only to find a few packets of hot sauce mixed with envelops of Quaker Oats--curiosity overwhelms to find out what the big deal is but prepare to for a big letdown

And for good reason too. They review movies for a living and are in the cinema almost daily. How do they follow up after giving a movie the supreme mark?
I respect their dedication to the art and think most of the reviews on this site are of no real value and based merely on the gut reaction of giving a movie 10 stars.
I also suspect that this time next year most people will have forgotten the movie and be raging against the latest thing.
This is not the perfect movie, It is not sitting there above all the other movies ever made. In fact it probably is not even the best movie released in 2019.
It is being put up on a pedestal that will crumble as people forgot about the circumstances of its release. And continue to read the professional reviews they rail against today. Because at the end of the day, an expert opinion is worth more than a million know-nothing reviews. "

The scene should have ended when she asked him to leave. It's not inception where u have to reveal it. Respect our intelligence and move on.<br/><br/>Second scene that I hated is the Thomas Wayne murder. It's been done a 100 times n this was underwhelming. You just make them walk down an alley, make the guys follow them and just edit a gun shot and we'll know what happened.

Casting choice of Joaquin Phoenix had me intrigued from the beginning, he is one of my favourite actors. He was absolutely phenomenal, i had to keep reminding myself that he is acting, i was blown away. De Niro is also great, for the limited scenes he is in, he shines as expected. When this was first announced, i was against it because of the mystery behind the character.. 'he doesn't need an origin story'. I still believe that but i loved this story, i by no means condone the criminal actions displayed in the film but at a movie review point of view, i was hooked from the beginning. I was in a state of shock in some scenes, which i found fantastic. The pacing is solid, little bit 'ehh' here and there but i was so invested that i didn't care. The music is great, both the tracks used in the film and those used in the trailers. I must admit, I've had the soundtrack on repeat for a few days now... The visuals are beautiful, the brilliant cinematography might not be as obvious as other films but in this case it was beautiful to watch. This has a darker tone than The Dark Knight, i wouldn't have it any other way! The darker tone is perfect. "

", The movie is masterpiece and first of it's kind....Joaquin performance is unbelievable and give the movie different taste ...very recommended 
6555," The Film is a 7, the performance is a 10!!
"," Joaquin Phoenix has had a wild and electric acting career and his rendition of the Joker doesn't disappoint. Phoenix's Joker represents all of the sadness and mental illness in the world and how society throws it to the side, like 'garbage.'<br/><br/>A character portrayal which displays the origins of how someone with a chemical imbalance can break down and go postal or even tragically participate in mass shootings.<br/><br/>The nuances and the idiosyncrasy of the performance is brilliant and tragically sad as this Joker relates to many people in real life. Other films Joker reminds me of is Taxi Driver, and Falling Down.<br/><br/>Finally, as brilliant and as academy award winning as the performance is, as this is a movie, it at times glorifies the Joker's behavior and because this movie hits so close to home with a lot of people, I only hope no one goes out and does something bad after seeing this film. There is nothing glorified about this sad and depressed behavior in real life and there's nothing glorified about doing evil things in real life. It's a just a movie. "
6556," Not many laughs here
"," I haven't seen any reviews of Joker, but I can there is sure to be a lot of comparisons between this and the dark knight. It is probably the biggest compliment to Joaquin Phoenix to say that his performance is certainly comparable to Heath Ledger in the dark knight.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly dark in mood and there are many things relevant to real life in the 21st century. The movie tells the story of how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker. It is a tough watch, but brilliantly shot and acted. The only thing I would question is the playing of a Gary Glitter song.<br/><br/>If you are into feel good movies then the Joker will not be for you. If you want to see a great acting performance then you'll be hard pushed to beat Joaquin Phoenix in 2019. "

You would really enjoyed, but I know it is due to the restriction from comic but the story is not complex enough in my mind. We all know what is going to be happened, Arthur would go nut and become the Joker. They gave us a good story but compared to the acting and producing, it can be better.
Another issue for me is that i feels like they are trying so hard to make a epic movie. I enjoy a movie with great camera work and acting, but to be honest for this one, sometimes I feels like they are trying too hard.
For example, for the scene he practiced the knock knock joke at home and pretend to shot himself, you just know there is going to be a scene that camera slowly rolling away, and there are going to be light coming from the ceiling, there are going to be contract of color from his brighter clothing and darker furniture. Don't get me wrong, it is a great scene, it gives you a sense of oil painting, but it just gave me the feeling that they are trying to achieve this.
A great movie like Dark Knight, it is epic not because Nolan is trying to make it epic, the story is just that great. But this one, I feels like their target is to create a masterpiece so they just create a movie to fit the ""standards"" for a masterpiece- great camera, great music, great acting etc,. They achieved it but it just seems to me it is a little bit artificial. "

6566," Punchline Hits You Where it Hurts
"," The whole masterpiece/not a masterpiece debate hinges on one thing. Is this simply a copycat movie a la some of Scorsese's finest cinematic moments or does it delve deeper than this? It certainly pays homage to and doffs its cap to Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy with some very obvious scenes. Both Sophie's and Arthur's mimed gun to the head moments much like Travis Bickle, and Arthur's delusional aspirations at becoming a stand up comic much like Rupert Pupkin. The inclusion of Robert De Niro as chat show host and comedian Murray Franklin certainly makes you very much aware of Bickle and Pupkin, quite possibly two of his most accomplished screen performances. I for one feel it's a masterpiece of sorts rather than an out and out masterpiece due to its heavy reliance on these particular films. However this in no way takes anything away from my appreciation of the movie and in fact took me back to my first experiences of watching those Scorsese films and being in awe of them. Jokers greatest achievement for me has been to combine these two films to create its own cinematic mix of potent movie craft. The character development is like watching a sculptor at work such is the painstaking way in which Arthur Flek's motivations and actions are displayed on screen. Joaquin Phoenix's acting of the part is quite simply staggering and kept me transfixed throughout the trials and tribulations he encounters. The nuances of his performance were spine tingling at times. There are two very distinct films at work with Joker and it's based on two very simple things ultimately. Inside you will find either a masterpiece or a film that comes so close to this, and this will be based on whether you have seen the two Scorsese films mentioned or not. If you've never seen those two films and see Joker fresh and unencumbered by past movie history then get ready for a deeply disturbing film that delves deeply into a dysfunctional society and the casualties it can produce. "

6573," #Joker Stand Alone Movie: Should be left alone or be toned down for general consumption
"," I'd say the character that #Joaquin portrays could've been in any other story or franchise &amp; it would be seen as disturbing &amp; too dark for the mainstream. It was well acted &amp; tears down the ""suspension of disbelief"" which takes the character out of the campiness that #Joker's portrayal has been in the past. If fans of the #DC stories can see this as a ""What if?"" or #Elseworlds story: then it's easier to swallow. I think for that reason alone, it hasn't been removed from mainline theaters.<br/><br/>It's a sad look at mental illness in real world settings that depict a part of what's going on around us w/a political tone that's definitely social commentary.<br/><br/>In reality, it very narrowly captures an element of the DCU within Gotham (that could very easily be New York or San Francisco, or at least the most lowest income areas of both w/a little bit of LA thrown in). That sets the tone: the familiarity with the underside of society that we all hope will ""just go away"" or ""is someone else's problem. We see a common enemy of big pharma &amp; Capitalism gone bad. We see a person seeking help (albeit through a broken system, that may have been forced on him). Then we see a man, who through the eyes of mental illness, comes to a breaking point. A breaking point we can all sympathize with. A breaking point, that we think might not be his own fault. Therein lies the rub: we relate &amp; disgust ourselves a little, and yet we can't look away at this travesty. That's why it's disturbing. We all find ourselves just 5 minutes away from making similar choices.<br/><br/>This movie takes us to the precipice of normality &amp; morality then takes a magnifying glass to our psyche.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping for a longer edition that works out even more of that complexity or at least a second one to explore that depravity &amp; not make just another ""violence for violence sake"" comic book storyline.

6576," Gritty, dark and tense
"," A great film. Phoenix portrays the joker in a mesmerising, Ledger-esque way. "
6577," A new look at an iconic villain.
"," Joker is the name Gotham citizens fear the most. Joker is the idea that brings fear and chaos to the streets of Gotham. Joker is the enemy that tempts Batman to do the unthinkable. We have seen all that before as audiences but what we have never seen is Arthur Fleck. A man suffering from multiple mental illnesses that have gone unaddressed and untreated.<br/><br/>This movie is way more disturbing than ever imaginable. It's an unflinching look at a man whose mind is in fractures and reality has began blending with delusion and fantasy as the streets of Gotham unravel and become unruly. Arthur laughs uncontrollably and has a card he presents to a woman and her child explaining it is a condition. Arthur slides further away from reality when the truths he once believed about his childhood are revealed to be lies and everything he knows may not even be real.<br/><br/>Visually bleak through out, the only real color appears in the make up that Arthur applies to himself. We can see the transformation star Joaquin Phoenix had to endure both physically and mentally in order to portray this character. Phoenix dances and smokes and lets out eerie laughter that will leave you cringing when he begins to up the ante and take life itself. As he does so a revolution that divides the upper class and the poor begins to erupt on the streets. Arthur desires to be a comedian but is laughed at and his laughs come just a beat off from the rest of the audience as we see just how unstable his mind truly is. His interactions as we get closer to the end are more and more volatile with increased tension and less predictability in how it plays out.<br/><br/>It truly is one of the most uncomfortable films that I have ever watched. Mostly because we see mental illness on the daily and how it damages people and leaves people feeling neglected and lost. If you remove all traces of the name Joker and all traces of the name Wayne and Gotham this film is still an unsettling look into a fractured mind that went ignored and could have been saved. One of the most polarizing films of 2019 as there are zero positive moments. It had moments of pure awkwardness (after Arthur kills a colleague, but let's a short person leave who is unable to reach the locked door) as well as moments that will break your heart (when you realize that the Arthur's relationship with a fellow tenant is all in his head). It works on the merit that it will always be willing to go where you least expect the narrative to go. It doesn't have the moments audiences are used to when Batman stops the unnerving moments from happening. It's a complete stand a lone film that creates and develops a completely new version of a villain that is iconic in nature.<br/><br/>It compares to the legendary portrayals of the past and is a film regardless of how one felt about it will be talked about for a while to come. If Phoenix doesn't score a nomination for Best actor next year then the single best lead performance of the decade will go overlooked. If this does not get a best picture nomination then the only film that bears a comic book name and to efficiently and realistically tackle mental illness on screen will also be overlooked. As uncomfortable as I felt at times, this is a necessary film to maybe guise itself under being a comic book based move while simultaneously reminding audiences to never be afraid to seek the help you need. We don't need to have the level of rebellion seen in this movie to make a difference and end the gap between the rich and the struggling. All we need is more compassion than the fictional Thomas Wayne showed in this film.<br/><br/>It's not the type of movie that will wow you with the action or impress you with the cool space sequence. It's definitely unlike any previous comic book movie to date. Phoenix has definitely cemented himself as a legendary Joker performer as he did so without a Batman to play off of and did so will presenting a truly haunting look at a man plagued by his own mind.<br/><br/>It truly is one hell of an experience and one hell of a film. If you come out of this uneasy and unsure exactly where it leaves you in your own mind then you grasped the entirty of the movie and then some. If you are uncomfortable with extreme depression, extreme delusional actions and violence as a result of a decaying mind then I strongly suggest you avoid this movie. It's the one movie no one will fault you for skipping. Everything it accomplished is meant to be done to the extreme in order to make you see how this all happened and to bring a little bit of humanity to a character that has often been criticised for having none at all.

"," Way too much fuss ! Is it a good enough movie? Sure ! It has its moments. But is it that good To stumble upon a rave review in every other second on social media ? Don't think so either. Joaquin Phoenix is a wild actor and as per his credentials he acted the hell out of an unhinged whacky character, the way he usually does. But for a movies perspective, following a single character throughout the whole movie even if he is the lead protagonist, restricts other characters buildup and it's not necessarily a good thing. 99.99% of the time Joker was infront of the lenses and sometimes it could be a little tedious even if it's Phoenix, u know! no breathing room for the storyline to grow.<br/><br/>Joaquin Phoenix: 9/10
Joker movie: 7/10<br/><br/>Cinematography was beautiful, no doubt about that. Storyline, not rich enough. Dialogues, don't even start !
Now, can u tell me anything that's new in this movie?<br/><br/>Plotted may be in a New Yorkish 80s era Gotham, combined two Scorsese classics Taxi Driver and king of comedies, blended Charles Bronson's famous anti heroic and public pleasing Deathwish shootout at subway and a subsequent public revolt. What else ? To prevent any IP lawsuit Todd even brought De Nero to negate that criticism and Scorsese as a producer (even though he dropped himself), he outdid at that part I give u that. So what's new in this movie that I should hail now ? I can tell tons of great anti establishment movies far better than this which never received any limelight , better anarchist than this movies Joker. Oh heck! even Heth Ledger was a better one in that regard.<br/><br/>Product of an opressive regime/failed society, vigilantism, showdown at live tv and a successive masked vigil showdown against establishment, does it sound similar ? If it is, then u r right my friend !! May be from ""V for Vendetta "" ?!<br/><br/>So why should I hail this movie? No brand new concept or ideology, no groundbreaking nothing. One linear storyline told from one single point of view. Only a very very good actor at the epitome of his career.Have I missed anything ? Some odd gimmicks could never make up for the lack of it. Quality dialogues, not even start !! At best it should get a soft 8 at IMDB, not what I'm seeing right now. "
6582," Why so delirious?
"," Reading some of the many reviews of 'Joker,' I have to wonder if the cinema in which I watched this film actually played the correct version. This is no masterpiece and unfortunately did not live up to the frenzied hype which it has received.<br/><br/>The idea of 'Joker,' i.e. an origin story about one of the most interesting and captivating villains ever being played by Joaquin Phoenix is mouth-watering. But sadly, I found the film to be unimaginative, predictable and boring.<br/><br/>There are few films where the phrase 'on the nose' is more applicable. 'Joker' is very aware of itself and handles its material and concepts too clumsily, serving its narrative upon the audience like a microwaved meal - pre-cooked and simple but not altogether satisfying. One such scene where it's revealed that all of Arthur's interactions with his 'girlfriend' were a figment of his imagination demonstrates this lack of subtlety perfectly - the fear and shock emanating from Zazie Beetz's character when Arthur turns up to her flat uninvited is more than enough to show that this interaction is maybe not one between two genuine lovers, yet the director still feels it necessary to insert a fight club style montage to show it was just Arthur's warped imagination all along! The bloodstained footprints when Arthur exits the scene were also something you'd expect more from an A-level horror film project rather than a fabled masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film simply fails to present an accurate depiction of what the Joker should be; clever, calculating and cold whilst retaining an element of charm that someone so charismatic and dangerous would naturally retain (see Harley Quin and admirers of Ted Bundy). An admittedly funny scene where Arthur walks into a glass door shows the character here is less prince of darkness more mad clown with clumsiness.<br/><br/>This is a film about descent into madness made by a person who isn't mad, as though the director sat with a checklist of all the things which could potentially make a villain and ticked them off scene by scene - mental illness, poverty, lives with mum, no friends, abuse, no more meds = villain. Then, how do we show this 'dark' descent - queue endless slow motion dance scenes and stomping of puddles.<br/><br/>Maybe the mouth-watering concept was just never that. After all, what makes the Joker so menacing and powerful is his mystique and merciless lack of motivation. A scene in Dark Knight springs to mind where Alfred recites the story about the gemstone robber - ""some men just want to watch the word burn"" - maybe the Joker should have just been left as that. "

This version of the joker is a combination of Nicholson and ledger but with a Phoenix twist . He is mesmerising every step of the way you feel for Arthur as you delve into his life and as he emerges as the joker you feel this sinister charismatic person come alive ! Probably my favourite of all jokers ( although most of them were all outstanding ) I hope to see more from Phoenix regarding joker as he plays him so perfectly .

I've seen a lot of post saying it's promoting bad mental health and encouraging people to be violent? ... what? This movie if anything is showing us that Society itself is the violent thing in this world that people need to start caring more it's not showing us The way to becoming a psychopath.

6591," Fantastic watch
"," Joker origins is a truly remarkable and totally immersive experience. Giving life to this eccentric character, Joaquin Phoenix fills the screen with outlandish movement and crazed laughter only for it to be tempered with majestic poise.
To have the ability to elicit empathy and pity from the audience for a madman is testament to the talents of Director, Todd Phillips, and the lead artist.

Joaquin Phoenix performance was beautiful "
6597," An interesting view of the mind
"," I found this to be quite an interesting view of a damaged mind. The breakdown, the daydreams and pressures of everyday life weighing down on a person clearly in need of support.<br/><br/>I personally feel that this 'Joker' is incomparable to any other joker as it's more about the man as opposed to the villain.<br/><br/>I did have an issue with the scale of uprising being so rapid and large. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Maybe it represents the state of anarchy and angst within the streets of Gotham, but in a normal world, that wouldn't of happened. I'm not sure if any of those uprisers would have known what exactly they were fighting about, certainly after seeing him kill a celebrity.<br/><br/>In regards to the violence... Well, it was tame in comparison to what I expected and to many other films I have seen come out. The difference I guess is that it is more believable. Anyone who walked out is a snowflake and needs to grow a pair. Seriously. The film does nothing to glorify gun violence so anyone preaching that also needs to sort themselves out. Plenty of other films make having a gun seem like a great idea - this films definitely does not do that.<br/><br/>Overall, this film really worked well, even without batman. The continuity between the films is a little off as this film showed a man in a joker mask killing the Waynes, whilst the others didn't.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid film with an incredible performance of Arthur Fleck the man that became Joker.<br/><br/>This also means that Heath Ledger remains the best Joker to date. "
6598," It was good, but could have been so much better
"," Phoenix is pulling this scripted movie by its ears. He is giving a performance of his lifetime, however the movie itself, the script and the setting is just wrong.<br/><br/>They made Thomas Wayne into a hearltess which he definately was not, in any of the comics that I know, they actually made him look like Trump or something.<br/><br/>They make us feel simpathy for the Joker, whereas he should simply be irredeemable. I kinda rooted for Ledger's Joker, but I always knew that Bats was the good guy and would eventually defeat him just because he was better than the Joker.<br/><br/>Again, 7 stars for Phoenix's performance, the rest was crap. "
6599," The Taxi Driver remake we needed in the age of Ultron
"," This film is, first and foremost, a revisiting of Taxi Driver. Which right off the bat should echo with the concerns of those who criticize this film for being derivative.<br/><br/>Yes, Joker is in many ways a remake of Taxi Driver for contemporary mainstream movie-goers, which uses the super-hero genre as an entry point for discussing serious social issues that would have likely been too taboo for basically any other major Hollywood superproduction of recent memory (save maybe Logan and Mad Max: Fury Road)<br/><br/>Yes, this is a (partial) remake of Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>The real question: is this necessarily a bad thing?<br/><br/>I won't pick apart all the subtle differences and less than subtle similarities between this film and Scorcese's take on the mass-murderering male. I will merely say that Joker seems to me, if nothing else, a labor of love for a type of socially conscious hollywood film that seems, in the age of flashy marvel ""super-men"" and ""super-women"", to be somewhat of an anachronism, but as I argue, a necessary one.<br/><br/>This film neither glamorizes far-right terrorism, as has been claimed, nor bestows an undue sympathy on misogynists or skinheads by virtue of their being misogynists or skinheads. Regardless of what such men may find of appeal in this film, simply put, Joaqu√≠n Phoenix's Joker is none of the above, and yet at the same time a vessel for helping to understanding all of the above as part of a broader critique of a society that produces poverty, privilege, ultrav-iolence, and sociopathic loneliness in equal measure.<br/><br/>It is a film that seeks to broach the often taboo subjects of class conflict, violence, and pharmaco-carceral police states in such a way that both pays homage to the films from the 19070's it explicitly cites (Taxi Driver, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) and repurposes their thought-provoking criticism for the age of Trump.<br/><br/>Joaqu√≠n Phoenix may channel Charlie Chaplin's tramp and Robert DeNiro's psychopath in equal parts, but make no mistake: this Joker is neither an incel, nor a Trump supporter. He is, quite literally, someone who stands with ""the 99%"", and that that shoots someone who sounds like and looks like and looks like he has about as much money and privilege and toxic spite for women as one of Donald Trump's sons.<br/><br/>Joker is, like Travis Bickle, a terrorist, of sorts. A man who lives out his particular male toxicity through testosterone-induced chivalric fantasies of domination and ""salvation"" (namely, of women of his social class perceived to be ""damsels"" in need of immediate rescue). A one-man rebellion, equal parts suicidal, homicidal, and populist, directed, in this case, not against the so-called ""low"" lifes Travis Bickle couldn't bring himself to have any sort of empathy with, but, first and foremost, against people in society who simply look down and spit upon the lives of others who they believe to be beneath them.<br/><br/>As Zazie Beetz's character would say (and I'm paraphrasing): were it any other movie, any other franchise other than Batman, Joker would indeed be a kind of hero. The quintessential folk hero: the bank robber, the escaped convict, the knight in shining armor, but more than that: Robin Hood.<br/><br/>By contrast to this anti-elitist social reject (who, very unlike Travis, does not use racist, immunitary, or criminoloical rhetoric as justification for his actions), Iron Man and Batman come off exactly as what they are: namely, billionaire playboys who justify their own use of ""police"" violence through the very existence of people (or, in Iron Man's case, ""aliens"") they claim to be dangerous. Joker, quite explicitly to the contrary of Christopher Nolan's take on the Batman mythos, is a film that asks, in a sense, for empathy to cut both ways. We can neither overlook that very real sense of empathy we may come to feel for Batman or iron Man's purported ""villains"" (re: victims), nor exonerate the members of their own aloof and privileged entourage for their complicity in perpetuating the very violence they claim to be enemies of.<br/><br/>It can be said that the true ""toxic"" masculinty of the film belongs, in this sense, not exclusively to the empathetic protagonist, but to the movie's surprise antagonist: Thomas Wayne, Batman's lionized billionaire father, whom in the comic books, as we know, would become the origin of Batman's ""motivation"" as a vigilante. In contrast to the unjustly murdered philanthropic billionaire of the Nolan films (a rich man ultimately trying to do ""his best"" for Gotham's underprivileged citizenry), here is a man who (it is suggested) either raped or otherwise impregnated and wantonly abandoned a servant in his employ, clearly in need of money for child care, who was instead pressured into silence and into renouncing any and all claim to having knowledge of the child's true parentage. A responsibility that the Wayne entourage, of course, blatantly denies, but that in the age of Epsteins and Trumps, perhaps should not seem so far-fetched.<br/><br/>Joker effectively takes the pseudo-dickensian demophobia of the Nolan films (for whom the very existence of ""the Joker"", qua terrorist, seemed to be ground enough to justify the declaration of an authoritarian state of exception), and flips it on its head. And this alone to me makes up for the movie's at times rather trite and clich√©'d pathetic soliloquies in defense of the ""little guy"".<br/><br/>If nothing else, Joker attempts to rescue populism from its Trumpist appropriation and equally sociopathic derivations.<br/><br/>At times a bit too heavy-handed and moralistic for its own good, at times too safe in its pathetic appeals for ""reform"" and ""increased funding"" for mental health care in an age of enduring care-sector privatization (a political conceit which, however laudable, ends up subverting much of the film's earlier and, to my mind, far more poignant and militant commentary on the shortcomings of trying to psycho-patholize violence), Joker's more enduring message of alarm should ring true enough.<br/><br/>Joaqu√≠n Phoenix's Joker may very explicitly state, in the film, that his motivations are anything but political, and yet, if the film does nothing else, it makes us ask if he is truly as alone as society has made him and as he himself would like to claim. A single sad man enacting his own personal violent vendettas does not a radical antiauthoritarian movement make: and yet we could ask, as one of the posters carried by a protester in the film seems to insinuate, if we weren't, each of us, ""clowns"" in our own right. Ask ourselves a rather disturbing but perhaps also enlightening question: could there not be little bit of the best (and also worst) of The Joker in all of us?<br/><br/>All I would say is this: if there is a little bit of the anarchist antiauthoritarian ""tramp"" in you, perhaps he is worth cracking a smile for. If there is, on the contrary, also a bit of the sad violent fascist ""trump"" in you, then perhaps you'd do well to try to remove it, as best you can. "
6600," A film for people who actually read comic books!
"," Enjoyable reimagination of the Batman origin story. It's hard to escape the heavy nod that Todd Phillips tips to Scorcese's ""King of Comedy"" and a healthy homage to Wally Pfister's cinematography in Nolan's Trilogy. This is a fun way to handle this type of material. Reinvent rather than retread. It demonstrates a similar type of maturity that began filtering into comic books themselves during the silver age of comic storytelling... when the art form began to take bigger and bigger chances, introducing politics and philosophy as ways for the stories to shine lights on the ills and troubles plaguing society at their respective times. If all art is communication, then the development of art is an aim towards becoming commentary that breaks through - a discourse rising above expected platitudes and transcending pure aesthetics. Mr. Phillips, I won't say that you've gotten any better as a director, but you remain provocative and a bit depraved, and you know who your subjects are and what makes them interesting. You've come a long way since ""Hated"", but luckily not TOO far. "

6605," The most conflicted I've been about a rating in years
"," Hey, I'm TheFilmNudist, and today I'll be review Todd Phillips' ""Joker.""<br/><br/>There's something about this movie that feels rushed, or unfinished, which is surprising for a two hour long film. Now that's not to say this is a bad movie; it isn't. In fact, i saw it twice, enjoyed it even more the second time, and might go see it a third. There's a lot to like and even love in ""Joker;"" but once the credits roll, the overall package feels disappointing.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly watchable and entertaining film, and I can't stop thinking about it. Joaquin Phoenix gives a mesmerizing performance, and he brings Arthur Fleck to terrifying life. As Arthur, Joaquin gives a sympathetic, and totally unrelatable performance. You can 100% sympathize with this character. He's lonely, he's depressed, and he's unsatisfied with the monotony of his life. He feels unloved and purposeless, and honestly, who hasn't felt like that from time to time. So as he's getting beaten, or made fun of, or harassed, you can't help but feel bad for him. Things just go from bad to worse for Arthur, and it makes ""Joker"" one of the saddest and most relentlessly bleak movies of the year. But when Arthur starts to lose it and unleash his rage on the people who he thinks deserve it, you can't help but wish he got the help he needed to curb his impulses. It's not fun watching him turn into the Joker; instead of feeling the excitement I anticipated, I just felt sadder and sadder while watching Arthur lose his mind and become the titular villain we all know. But I can't deny that it was effective viewing. In ""Suicide Squad"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" viewers will most likely root for the Joker and want to see what villainous shenanigans he pulls off next. But in this, I assume most viewers will be increasingly frustrated and disgusted with Arthur's behavior, which is effective. This is the first time in a long time I can actively remember being turned off by the villain and wishing he would turn toward good.<br/><br/>And while I wouldn't necessarily say that this movie has a lot of depth to it, there is certainly enough to keep you thinking about it for days afterward. I don't want to spoil anything specific, but the opening and the ending specifically have a lot of meat to chew on if you stop to think about it. The movie arguably starts at exactly the moment when Arthur starts his descent towards being the Joker, and ends at arguably the moment when Joker is thinking about creating his arch-nemesis, and both scenes are masterful at instilling a sense of dread within the viewer.<br/><br/>The directing, cinematography, and score are also all top notch. Every scene, every frame, and every sound worked together fantastically to evoke emotion within the viewer; there are scenes in here that I cannot stop thinking about because of how twistedly beautiful they were. One scene in particular after Arthur commits his first crime is so gorgeously dark that I want to see the film again just to witness that particular sequence on the big screen once more. And of course, needless to say, the acting is incredible and if Mr. Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for best actor then I'll be jumping off a bridge (I'll take any excuse at this point).<br/><br/>Like I said, there's a ton to love about this film. But I can't help but shake the feeling that the movie should have been at least another hour longer. The film ends as soon as it's getting going; it really leaves you wanting more. And while that is a good thing in theory, in reality it just leaves the audience mildly unsatisfied. I mean, all spoilers aside, Arthur finally becomes Joker within the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie, and in my personal opinion, this doesn't really give the audience enough to be completely satisfied. Yes, I know this is a character study about Arthur, but the movie is called ""Joker,"" and seeing the Clown Prince of Crime is something that the audience is expecting to see. And they do see it, but most likely not as much as they'd like.<br/><br/>I haven't agonized this much over a rating in a long time. I did really enjoy this movie (more the second time than the first when I had time to process how dark and depressing it is), and the overall look and feel of the movie is important; this movie looks like an arthouse film, and has a slow burn typical of an arthouse film, and the fact that it is being widely released to general audiences in the guise of a super villain movie is in my eyes a milestone of cinema. But, even though I loved the acting and directing of this movie, I can't help but wish the plot would've been deeper and longer than it actually is.<br/><br/>I know it seems like I'm being very nitpicky, but this is a very hard film to review without explicit spoilers. Yes, I really loved multiple aspects of the film, and I can't wait to see it again. But the overall package felt short-winded and in need of more footage. Overall, I would recommend you going to see ""Joker,"" but don't go expecting the action packed super villain romp that you may expect.<br/><br/>6/10 "

The plot weaves nicely into existing or previous versions of the Batman storyline, but does not spend too much time on how Bruce Wayne's path crosses the Joker's tragic story. This version far surpasses any other. The story is fresh, interesting, intelligent and even ventures to be relevant in current times and explains the problems relating to real life mental health issues.

I just kept 1 star off the rating as i thought it could have a few more plot twists that could have helped the screenplay. All in all no complains. Go watch it today. "
6633," Simply brilliant
"," Could honestly say it's one of the, if not THE, best marvel/dc films i've seen. You're able to care for the Arthur and feel so much stress and worry for him within a few moments of the opening scene. About an hour into the film I felt it was mine numbingly depressing and needed something big to happen within the story to engage me.<br/><br/>Well I was not left disappointed when the intense last half an hour had the same epic feel that you get when watching the latest 3 batman instalments. I was left wanting to stand up and clap the film for its excellence. The director and Joaquin Phoenix were able to fill me with 100 different types of emotion and help me to remember the feeling I felt when I read ""The End"". "
6634," Joaquin Phoenix is God!
"," I have just witnessed a masterpiece of an acting! I can't remember the last time I've seen a performance like that. The movie was well written, brilliantly directed and would like to see it once again! "
6635," Joker laughs his way to the bank
"," The film is incredible (not perfect) but an interesting character study. And that is the key...this film (while being in the world of comics) is not a ""comic book movie"". It's an in-depth look at a man who is more and more becoming disassociated from society and reality. And Joaquin Phoenix as the title character is a real tour de force. You get to watch him on this journey as a shy, mild-mannered mentally ill, depressed man into this confident, cocky, psychotic man. And he does it brilliantly. You'll feel sorry for him, you'll be creeped out by him. I don't know if there's another male performance this year that really comes close to the kind of work Joaquin put in with such a layered performance like this.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked about this film is that it feels true to the time period. And I dont just mean the costumes...It just genuinely feels like this could be a film from the late 70s/early 80s. And stylistically, I think Todd Phillips did a great job directing the film. Props to the cinematographer as well.<br/><br/>Now even though I did really like this film, because it is such a character study of this one guy..unfortunately the other characters get shafted. Especially Zazie Beetz's character Sophie. She's in there to really just serve as Arthur's fantasy woman. She doesnt really have much to do except to laugh and smile and comfort him. I honestly just had to look up her character name, that's how literally unmemorable/unimportant she is. There is also a scene involving her where the director really goes out of his way to make something super obvious to the audience by using flashbacks, that wasnt really necessary. Another thing, there is one part that is a bit spoiler-y so caution ahead....but at one point in the film Arthur is led to believe that Thomas Wayne is his real dad. And the thing that bugged me, is that he didnt really look THAT much older than Arthur. (I just looked it up and the actors are 18 years apart). So yeah technically old enough to father a kid, but I dont know, I just didnt find that plausible. And I suppose Joaquin could be playing a bit younger and Brett Cullen could be playing a bit older, but it just struck me a bit odd. The other thing about this reveal that bugged me a bit is that we know this is a one-off film and has no relation to other Batman movies past or future and so this possible tension of Joker-and Batman being related is squandered. Its ultimately squandered anyway since its revealed this his mom is actually delusional and spent time in Arkham. But even if it was true, you know it would ultimately go nowhere.<br/><br/>Now onto the violence controversy. Yes, it is violent. But I would say its a more gritty, realistic approach. It doesnt feel to cartoony...and while bloody isnt a super gore fest. Its not like you're gonna watch someone get sawed in half, or have guts pool out on the ground or a jaw break off.<br/><br/>Overall though, I did really enjoy it. I would recommend seeing it, but just know what you're getting into. "
6636," Put on a Happy Face
"," The most controversial film of the year is also one of the best. This may have not been the best time to release this type of film, but from a pure technical standpoint; it's damn good. The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal and should nab him the Oscar. The direction by Phillips is also some of the best this year as he really captures the environment by providing us with great cinematography and storytelling. The score is also an amazing addition to the film as it captures the overall mood of the film. Did this film stretch a little too long and is it disturbing? Absolutely. Do I really want to watch this again? No. It's filmmaking at its finest though. "

From how Arthur pretended to be optimistic to how he became disappointed to the world from how afraid he was when he killed the three guy to how crazy he was when he killed the host when facing the famera Joaquin's act is definitely wonderful
After seeing how he being lied(the gun thing) and how he was humiliated I can't help saying:Sorry Arthur It's the world that fails you

Thankfully for me I did not seek violence as retribution, although I certainly thought about it. A dark film, a meaty film, and one that makes us all think, ""We must account for our actions as individuals, no matter who we are."" "
6646," Outstanding
", This is one of those rare movies that is able to linger in your head for a long time. The descent of the joker into madness was truly something to behold.

Im not gonna repeat the many people who wrote earlier. But what i am going to say is that if Joaquin does not get an Oscar for it, then Oscars must be cancelled! His performance was absolutely mind-blowing. The whole movie: the costumes, music, decorations, screenplay, direction - literally everything is flawless. You cannot better it in any way. "

6661," This is no joke
", Went to see this today with my son...we didn't speak or take our eyes off the screen from start to finish Joachim Phoenix is utterly mesmerising. The Joker is my favourite DC character and this film was all I hoped it would be. Dark moody and totally compelling telling the proper story of the Joker 
6662," The Machinist meets Silence of the Lambs
", The subtle violence and depth of the character was well balanced. This was purely focused on the Joker background and neatly tied into the origin of Batman. The mental illness and povertous background made sense and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal was flawless! T 
6663," No the hype is not real
", The movie resembles so much to taxi driver phoneix is great 10/10 for the acting but the storyline looked so much the same as taxi driver's due to which the movie lacked lustre nothing extra or jaw dropping that was really expected from this movie disappointed as there was nothing new to the story or scenes just a rip of from here and there still a good movie.

"," Holy ****. This is hands down the best film of the year so far! Phoenix was made to play this role, the character is so unsettling and his demonic laugh will stay with you. In the dark knight, Heath Ledger was playing the joker. However, in this film, Phoenix is playing as Arthur Fleck. This is a new type of joker we have never seen before and is just as crazy as the Ledger Joker, if not more. The film manages to maintain the tension throughout the run time and also has some scenes you'll never forget. The movie is very controversial, but I feel that it was made to be like that. "

‚ö°Reviewing the storyline of the film ""Joker"" without giving any spoiler.
(Release date:04 October,2019)
‚úÖOk,at first let me tell you this movie is directed by Todd Philips &amp; also written by Todd Philips &amp; Scott Silver.The genres are crime drama &amp; thriller.
Film review:Joaquin Phoenix was the joker in this film.Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath ledger's Joker,Jack Nicolson's Joker and Alex in a clockwork orange.
Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get his oscar for this movie then the oscar should be cancelled. Phoenix was amazing as you might've heard from every review ever!But Todd Philips is at his best here.Cinematography was very good,the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film, the storyline he takes &amp; the visuals are just breathtaking üôÇ.The acting &amp; plot are what sold it though.Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies.And I got to be honest there are scenes that are violent.However in my opinion this film needs to be nominated for Best Picture, screenplay,cinematography, actor,director &amp; Score.

"," An exceptional performance from Joaquin (I will lose faith in the oscars if he doesn't win best actor for this!) and an incredible unfolding story with a poignancy that different people will reflect on different ways. For me, it reinforced my belief that the vulnerable in society need support, care and love. When we neglect this duty, the results can be horrendous "

This movie is so deep and profound and it's a concentrated version of the world when you really think about it. This movie is amazing. Joaquin was phenomenal. Cinematically the film was perfect.

6677," Joker is true cinema.
"," Joker is probably the best film I have seen, it is very beautifully filmed and well written. I like that it is very inspired by Scorsese's gritty 70s crime dramas (Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, ect...) and the odd humour definitely has One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest vibes. Although it is dark and disturbing it is still a very beautiful and melancholy film. Joaquin Phoenix did a great and complex portrayal of mental health and the Joker. I'm expecting the film to win some Oscars this year.
Joker is true cinema. "

"," As we watch Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck pass trought the Gotham's raw and rude reality, we can also feel his development, a deep and brutal script and actor achievement. "
6680," A great movie treated unfairly!
"," Me speaking about the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix, or the surprising work of the director Todd Phillips will not be that of an importance, many people have spoken about it already, and it needs no prove for we all know it's the best movie for the last 5 years at least, if not, at least the best actor, do not listen to those who wanna ruin a good movie for you.
People find it hard to understand that THIS IS JUST MOVIE, it's a work of art, it's uneven to control it, a work of a director is to make art, he is not responsible for teaching people how they should perceive the movie
Movies are the window of our imagination, as humans we have the capacity of feeling so many emotions that we do not have a chance in our life right now to feel, and art is the gateway for all our fantasies, it has nothing to do with the real world, the movie is about a BAD PERSON, we all know that, so we must cut the nonsense and enjoy the art that is this movie.

The story, the picture, the character, the sound, everything about this movie is done so very well, it is a true masterpiece. Easily one of the best movies I have seen. Full of powerful moments and surprises, no stones left unturned. Although fictional, is an eye opener to mental health, and relates well to the real word in some aspects. I agree that it should not be compared to endgame, however I will compare it to the dark knight for being such a high quality movie that is not overly far fetched and very engaging, I will also compare it to breaking bad for how well it tells a story (just relax if you disagree with that) "
6688," *throws Oscar at Phoenix
"," Joaquin Phoenix's Joker is unapologetically raw and satisfyingly shocking. Being a iconic villain you couldn't help but be sympathetic towards him and that's the beauty of this film. Every single expression of Phoenix screams Joker. He was hauntingly magnificent, you just can't take your eyes off him. An awestruck performance that will haunt your thoughts for days!<br/><br/>Heath Ledger would be so proud. "

6694," THIS is the Joker in the comics
"," I think this hews closer to the Joker in the comics. Ledger's Joker was pretty good, but so so very smart. This one is just..Joker. Very good helming by director. I'm sure the editing and sounds will also get a nod in the Oscars. It's good they have De Niro there. The style of filming and setting of the film follows one of his classics. There was a subplot there that didn't pan out I don't if it was in the comics, but that would have a good source material for another Batman edition. And of course, Phoenix got his craft down in this movie. Character development üëåüèΩ Warning: this is a serious film! "

"," Todd Phillip's masterpiece ""Joker"" brings us into the mind of a haunted and twisted man named Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix truly captivates this horrific character and gives us a disturbing, Oscar worthy performance. While watching the film I never thought of this person as Phoenix but instead I was convinced that I was watching the tribulations of the deeply troubled Arthur Fleck. Phillip's camerawork was surprisingly amazing in this film as well. There are amazing shots in the film that not only show the bleakness of the worn down streets of Gotham City but also slowly reveal Fleck's decent into madness. Don't believe the critics saying not to see it because this film is amazing. "
6706," Taxi Driver starring the Joker
"," Excellent performances all around. Finally a DC movie that doesn't feel like too many ideas being thrown into one movie. Joker is very much a singular cohesive vision that has not a single wasted moment. The back drop of a Gotham city ravaged by wealth inequality sets up the perfect environment for a disturbed character like Joker to emerge as the clown prince of crime. The tax dodging 1% might find this movie ""too controversial"", but this movie is not for them anyways. Highly recommended for comic and non-comic book fans, don't miss this. "

Now for the question that ties to the ending.....is any of it real? There are at the beginning of the film two clocks both show the same time...is one the delusion and one the real and thus is any of it real apart from the one clock and the ending? Just my mind seeing other levels as we already know he sees a fabrication so is the whole thing a fabrication from within his cell?
I will leave it with you. "

Everyone in theater was blown away and I kept hearing WOW and OMG! I have never gone to see a movie a second time in the theater, but I am 100% going back to see it again next weekend! "
6734," Joker is not just a joke
"," When i saw this movie in the early 10 minutes, i know this movie is brilliant. The actors, drama, violent and joke is best for me. Best movie have i ever seen. The ending is blur make the viewer asking what is the joker generally. "
6735," MOVIE MASTERPIECE, PHOENIX RISING
"," This should do for prequels what GODFATHER 2 did for sequels, and it needs to be said that the movie itself is just as fine as its celebrated star's performance. Though it surely will not make the kind of money Marvel kiddie-crap usually strives for, this violent journey into the dark side of mental illness seems geared toward satisfying more adventurous audiences. So leave the kids and impressionable teens at home, and take a walk on the wild side with Mr. Phoenix through these very dark, very mean streets of Gotham. "
6736," Amazing performance
"," What an amazing performance by Joaquin, I'm
A big fan of his and when he didn't win the Oscar for Walk the Line I literally cried. He is a real actor, his devotion to the craft is incredible. "
6737," Political Paranoia
"," As unrest unravels across the world, Joker shines. This is the best origin story I could have asked for and then some. What's there to say that hasn't been said:<br/><br/><ul><li>Phoenix has peaked here.</li><li>Great soundtrack (though I dislike the emotional cuing in some of the score)</li><li>Masterful plot with greater themes</li></ul><br/><br/>Mental health is an ongoing crisis in the United States and it needs to be addressed properly as well as mass shootings. I do not believe this film incites violence, but merely shows the dire consequences when people who are deemed crazy are marginalized, dehumanized, and treated like mere clowns. "
6738," Not only the best comic book movie, but the best movie I have ever seen.
"," This movie is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is pheneonal. It left me with dread and satisfaction that I didn't thought was possible. When the movie was announced, I was pretty skeptical but this proved me so wrong.I adore this movie. Brilliant. "
6739," Sympathy with the Devil
"," Note: I'm a fairly hardcore Batman fan. I'm not sure if that sways my rating or not, but several of my superhero-hating friends also thought it was scarily enjoyable.<br/><br/>Joker was somehow exactly what I hoped it would be but also totally shattered my expectations, and both of those are extremely high bars for an avid Batman fan like myself. The first half caused me to simultaneously feel deeply rooted sympathy and repulsion for the most illogical of man's creatures, which is again quite the accomplishment. For the entire second half, my heart never stopped pounding out of my chest, and I was fighting back nervous laughter at how horribly perfect everything was. This movie made me feel the closest I've ever felt with the Joker, which was a scary and beautiful experience. "
6740," Masterpiece! A Truly Marvelous Masterpiece!
"," Boy! I tell you, I had very little expectations and I caught myself almost standing up and clapping for such an amazing movie. I'm sure it's the start of a string of movies. It's a fresh introduction for comic book fans and newcomers alike. You're captivated in the eyes and mind of the protagonist who's known to me an iconic antagonist. However, because of his actions and the settling ambience portrayed in this film, you're caught wanting more and actually applauding his motives. It's the perfect psychological drama film that's more than just a origin story, it's a masterpiece! Far beyond my expectations and hopes for such film. "
6741," We are the super rats.
"," When I read the comments on pushing the Oscar to Phoenix or claiming the best movie ever about a comic book, I just feel the movie made all the sense. Its a Joker assaulted by the desire of becoming a star, and the process of raging against society for not becoming one. Dont we live in that world right now? Great acting, great soundtrack and beautiful image.<br/><br/>But this environment has nothing to do with Ledger's Joker, in my opinion! Totally different movies! Enjoy! "
6742," Beautiful, dark, and amazing.
", This movie is incredible. From the choices in the camera work to the amazing score to the incredible performance by Joaquin Phoenix. They didn't beat you over the head with Batman references either which was refreshing. The thing about this movie is that you can not be into comic books and still enjoy this as a movie. Props to all involved! Only question I have is if we can get more somewhere down the line? 
6743," Pretty Amazing
", Some of the critic reviews leave me wondering if they even watched the same movie. This show is nothing short of phenomenal. Goes to show why most of us go off audience reviews instead of trusting some of these critics that have nothing but negative things to say. It's nice that the majority of critics did give it a good rating. I got chills watching this. And the score fit perfectly with each scene. Well done! 
6744," Best joker
"," I remembered the first time I saw the character of the joker .. I was fascinated by this character .. Because it's cartoon .. But when I saw Heath Ledger with Nolan .. I saw that filmmakers see this character is more than just an enemy .. My head is Heath Ledger, and I bet Joaquin Phoenix will overtake him. ..And uncomfortable in my seat .. I took out everything in my heart in my discharge to perform Joaquin .. and an early celebration of Oscar deserved to Joaquin .. in short .. Thanks Joaquin "

6746," Acting extraordinaire Joaquin once again proving why the Phoenix family is one of the most talented in hollywood !
"," Okay so, I went into this film finding myself quite bored 10 minutes in. Not because the film itself was boring, but because I had gone into it expecting carnage from the getgo despite literally knowing it's supposed to be a backstory. Once I got myself over that thanks to the wonderful lead actor, I realised that this film is fantastic and at that point it was literally based sheerly on his performance alone. It was well and truly magnificent. It was everything you want and deserve from a Joker portrayal...and then even more. It's not a superhero movie, so dont expect tonnes of action. the film's more of a psychological thriller...so expect tonnes of madness (am i allowed to say that?). All in all, very powerful film, if not for the script and storyline then most definitely for the oscar worthy acting. Also I have GOT to talk about that talk show scene!!!! amazing stuff. amazing!!!! amazing !!!! amazing!! work!!! I really do hate to compare but it's clearly the Heath Ledger hospital scene of this movie. A massive round of applause to all involved, but especially the beyond talented Joaquin Phoenix. "
6747," Very good film
"," This film almost lives up to its hype. Very good, but ""one of the best films ever"" ? No. What I liked best about it is the score. Excellent, creepy and melodic. What I liked the least is the idea that he would start a violent urban movement of people rioting in clown masks just by shooting three Wall street brokers in metro. It wasn't even clear to the public what the motive of the shooter was. I also don't understand why he killed the shrink woman in the asylum. As for the Phoenix's performance, it's very good but not as amazing as many reviewers say. Overall, a very good film but not an amazing masterpiece. "
6748," Good Movie
", The Story line is good and Pheonix acting is also great. 
6749," Look before you type
", People keep saying it's just a guy going through some sad Man going through some trauma but that's what it supposed to be it's supposed to be a guy who gets bullied on the streets and if people can't realize that and appreciate the film for that being that when people are just don't know how to write mo Man going through some trauma but that's what it's supposed to be it's supposed to be a guy who gets bullied on the streets and if people can't realize that and appreciate the film for that being that when people are just don't know how to rate. Movies people only say that's bad so they can get more attention on this app but I think not this movie was good and I want to see it again
